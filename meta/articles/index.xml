      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/40829/who-are-the-other-vishistadvaita-philosophers-and-what-are-their-most-important/42412#42412&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadly Ramanuja&amp;rsquo;s school of Vedanta identifies two traditions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a tradition of personal education including spritual initiation, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a tradition of Vedantic exegesis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important pre-Ramanujan Acharyas in the tradition of personal education are Nammazhvar, Nathamuni and Yamunacharya. Thir works are well known:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nathamuni&amp;rsquo;s works are lost but some fragments are available in quotations and citations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yamunacharya&amp;rsquo;s works are partially available; the Siddhitrayam and the AgamaPramanyam being his most important works that are extant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nammazhvar&amp;rsquo;s works which are in Tamil are completely available with a flourishing tradition of post-Ramanujan commentaries. The correspondence between the Upanishadic verses and those of Nammazhvar are striking and it is most fitting that his verses are called Tamil Upanishads or Tamil Vedas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to the tradition of Vedantic exegesis, Sri Ramanuja says the following in the beginning of the Sribhashya commentary on the Brahmasutras:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Indica, IndiaFacts&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Śrī Rāmānuja’s Vedāntic Harmony: Samanvaya As A Paradigm For Social Harmony&lt;br&gt;&#xA;M A Alwar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Śrī Rāmānuja was a philosopher par excellence and the famous proponent of the philosophy called Viśiṣṭādvaita. The religious side of that philosophy is called Śrīvaiṣṇavism. It is often said that philosophy without religion is lame and religion without philosophy is blind. Hence philosophy and religion should go hand in hand for their survival. On the one hand, the religious aspects needed for spiritual progress are strengthened by theoretical foundations and, on the other hand, philosophy finds purpose in the practice of religion. In Śrīvaiṣṇavism both religious practices and theories are inseparably associated as it can be witnessed in the several rituals that are performed by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given below is the list of 74 simhasanAdhipathis of YathirAjar, as appointed&#xA;by Him.&#xA;This list is provided by Sri Anbil Ramaswamy and is available in&#xA;Ramanujacharya Home page created by Sri Achutharaman. (under Acharya&#xA;vamsavruksham)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BHAGAVAD RAMANUJA&amp;rsquo;S SISHYAS WHOM HE NOMINATED AS SIMHASANA ADHIPATHIS:&#xA;Bhagavad Ramanuja installed 74 of his disciples as Simhasana Adhipathis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Authorities mainly are: AVM, GLE and ATA:-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chottai Nambi, son of Aalavandaar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pundarika, son of Mahapurna&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yaamuna, son of Goshti purna&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sundara bahu, son of Maalaa dhaara&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Raamaanuja, son of Saila purna&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PARAASARA BHATTAR (and his brother, sons of Aalvaan)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parasara Bhattar was the son of Kurathalwan. His Acharya was Embar. He learned the Sastras so well that he came to be called a &amp;lsquo;walking university&amp;rsquo;. His works include his commentary on Vishnu Sahasra Nama Bashya 1,000 names of Vishnu ) also known as &amp;lsquo;Bhagavad Guna Darpanam&amp;rsquo;, Rangaraja Stava, Ranganatha Ashtaka, Sri Guna Ratna Kosam, Kriyaa Deepam, Ashta Sloki, Satusloki, Dvisloki, Tanisloki  While he was a kid, a haughty Advaita exponent by name &amp;lsquo;Vidvad Jana Kolahala Panditha&amp;rsquo; was being carried on a palanquin to engage in a debate with Ramanuja. The boy stopped him on the way. Holding a handful of sand in his closed fist, he asked the Panditha how much of sand was there in his palm. The Panditha was nonplussed and asked how could anyone count the sands. Parasara retorted saying that if he could not answer that it was just a &amp;lsquo;fistful&amp;rsquo; how did he propose to win an argument with the great Ramanuja. The Panditha praised the boy, his father Kuresa and his Acharya, Embar. The Panditha subsequently became the disciple of Parasara assuming the name of &amp;rsquo; Per Arulala Perumal Emperumanar&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first prominent Ramanujadasa of Odisha . Under him , Srimandira underwent some changes that are now the hallmark of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lakshmi temple ,Sridevi and Bhudevi with Bhagavan and the kitchen are his influence (neighbouring states have all Saraswati with Vishnu).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Also the chalanti pratima concept and the mock quarrel between Lakshmi and Narayana as Bachanika .&lt;br&gt;&#xA;These are common in Pancharatrika temples of the South  too .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
