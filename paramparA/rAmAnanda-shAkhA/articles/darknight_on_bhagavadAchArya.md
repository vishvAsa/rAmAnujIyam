The actual issue with few rAmAnandis like bhagavadAcharya was about the presence of sri rAmAnuja in the guru parampara.
They did not want the lineage to continue from rAmAnujAcharya, they wanted to separate.

He made afalse claim that sri rAmAnuja was never part of guru parampara which is totally false because their own grantha bhakti mAla says the sampradaya emerged from rAmAnuja sampardAya. This was noted by PBA swami in 1940 itself he said rAmAnandis initially accepted that they were from lineage of uch as Namalvar, Nath Muni, Udayavar, and Manavala Mamunigal , but some group was not broke and they themselves called upon as direct lineage of rAmAnandi not sri vaishnava.

The end punch , bhagavadAcharya who caused ashastra padthi becaue he employed janeu distribuition like arya samajis because he was an Arya Samaji. He  also said rAma krishna are not bhgavAn but avatras of bhagavAn god only knows what it means , being rAmAnandi he went against their core principle
