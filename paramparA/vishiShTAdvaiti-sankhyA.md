svAminArAyaNa tradition of gujarAt, rAmAnandi-s of N India, vaikhAnasa-s etc.. are vishiShTAdvaitins only. They're infact more populous than shAnkara-s.

And rAmAnuja's followers are spread fro TN to nepAl and sikkim.

Folks who read and memorize rAm-charita-mAnas (a VA text) >>> folks who read shankara's works

Those who visit tirupati (vaikhAnasas are VA too) >> those who visit the shAnkara maThas etc..

However, among soma-yAjins, agnihotrins and aupAsana performers, (nominal) shAnkara-s dominate.

shankara enjoys greater brand-name than vishiShThAdvaidin pioneers like rAmAnuja.
