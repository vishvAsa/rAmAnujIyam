कृष्णदेवराय-मुख्यानां राजगुरवस् तातार्य-वंश्याः।

> The KDR copper plate which gives first teertham in all Vishnu temples to a venkata tatarya makes it clear that he was considered as foremost among SVs by KDR. And this tatarya was considered as the person who shall adjudicate on all SV matters.

> In amukramalyada 6.66, he calls Mamuni, Desika and Adivan Satakopan as avataras of Ramanuja. Krishnamachariar came out with a book by someone who questioned the validity of Adivan Satakopan getting sanyasa from nrsimha. But KDR mentions the same story as well.

> While Basava Dikshita and Vyasaraja are referred as "guru", the shrIvaiShNava Govindaraja (descendent of anantAchArya) is identified as "Guru/ AchArya of Krishnadevraja himself".
