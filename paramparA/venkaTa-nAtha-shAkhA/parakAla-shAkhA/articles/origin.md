### PREFACE 
IN response to the request of a large number of the younger generation amongst those who have constituted the bulk of the sishyas of the Mutt, I have written this brief sketch of the origin and growth of Śri Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami's Mutt at Mysore. It should have been very properly commenced with the history of Śrī Vedantha Desika, the Great Teacher, Poet, Saint and Philosopher. But that history has been widely known to the bulk of the Śrīvaishnavas of the South. I have therefore begun with Śrī Periya Brahmatantra Swatantra Swāmi, the immediate Sanyasi successor of Śrī Nigamantha Mahā Desika, who had the good fortune to receive the gift of the image of Sri LakshmiHayagrīva, worshipped in the Mutt. This humble work of mine is based upon 

1) a study of the "Guruparamparā-Prabhāvam" (a very much condensed work from that of the 3rd Brahmatantra Swatantra) published under the aegis of Sri Krishna Brahmatantra Swatantra Parakala Swami; 
2) tradition handed down from centuries, preserved by the families counting themselves as the disciples of the Mutt from amongst whom the Swāmis presiding over the Mutt have been chosen; 
3) a study of some of the works like the "Parakala Guru Vijaya and "Uttara Parakāla Guru Vijaya" relating to the Swāmis; 
4) some inscriptions and important [[iv]] documents, sannads, etc., available in the Mutt. 

For the last, I am very grateful to Śri Mukhāmi Narasimha Raghavachariar, Mahāvidwan, who has allowed me access to them, by command of His Holiness the present Parakāla Swāmi. 

I must remind my fellow-disciples, the readers, that they owe an incalculable debt of gratitude to the illustrious occupants of the great, universally revered, Royal Throne of Mysore, to whose continuous and unstinting and devoted patronage, the Mutt owes its eminent position and usefulness to the world at large. The disciples' unalloyed devotion and loyalty is due to the Rulers of this great Kingdom, which has played the most distinguished part in the preservation of the glorious culture of this beloved ancient land, once threatened with total destruction. I place this little work as a humble offering at the sacred lotus feet of "Sri Lakshmi Hayavadana Divya Pādukā Sevaka Śrīmad Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla Mahā Desikar with the profoundest pranamams. If the work will help the present and coming generations to cherish loyal devotion on their part to the institution and enable them to regulate their conduct, character and aspirations,-for the fulfilment of their souls - consistently with the ideals placed before them by the Swāmis and the Mysore Rulers, their Royal Sishyas, in the midst of the distractions to which mankind is subjected by the onrush of the modern ideas of "Civilisation ", I shall consider myself as having been richly rewarded. 

The author takes this opportunity to record his deep indebtedness to Sri. A. S. Ramanatha Ayyar, B.A., Madras, for his most valuable contribution in the Epigraphia Indica [Part VII, Vol. XXV, July 1940, pp. 318-26] entitled "Conjeevaram Inscription of Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar, Šaka 1282". The learned article serves a memorable supplement to the "Guruparamparā-Prabhāvam" as regards the origins of the Mutt and the contributions made to its usefulness by that sage. 

I take this opportunity to express my grateful thanks to Sri. V. V. Srinivasa Aiyangar Swami for having kindly written a Foreword to this humble work. 

My warmest thanks are due to my friend, Sri. Chakravarthi Rāmānuja Iyengar, M.A., L.T., for his valuable suggestions, and to Sri. G. Srinivasa Rao, Superintendent, Bangalore Press, for its neat get-up. 

My grateful thanks are also due to the eminent scholar, Sri. C. K. Venkata Rāmaiya, M.A., for kindly rendering the "Foreword" into Kannada, in his inimitable style.

### FOREWORD 

AT long last this brochure which might have been presented to the public a long time ago has now been prepared and published. His Holiness the present occupant of the pontifical throne, Sri Hayagrīva Divya Paduka Sevaka Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakalaswami of Sri Parakala Mutt, Mysore, we may be sure, inspired and ordered a compilation of a record of the origin and history of the Mutt from all available sources. On my own behalf and on behalf of hundreds of thousands of devotees, I take this occasion to lay before His Holiness our profound sense of gratitude and gratification for this publication. 

From all we are able to see and ascertain, Sri Parakala Mutt, with its headquarters at present in the city of Mysore, is undoubtedly the first Vaishnavite Mutt in South India. Many things and institutions in the world have had only a small, if not, insignificant; beginning. But the record here published to the world shows clearly that the Great Parakala Mutt had a great and glorious beginning in the mandate of Sri Devarāja Swami of Kanchi followed up by a stone inscription regarding the event. 

Asceticism has been constituted into an Ashrama in the map of human life according to our ancient scriptures. I wonder if any other map of life in 

viii 

any other country or religion has anything at once so natural, so beautiful, so ideal as that Ashrama. The donning of orange robes in due course according to this plan is the symbol and solemn dedication of the evening of life to the service of God and man. Even in these degenerate days when everything ancient seems to be in danger of being treated with ridicule, it is a matter for no small consolation that to-day we find so many great souls and spiritual leaders who have espoused that Ashrama are endeavouring each in his own manner and measure to promote ancient learning and spiritual revival. It is true that Sri Vedanta Desika did not himself enter that Ashrama. There can be no doubt that the choice was a deliberate decision on his part. But at the same time there is no doubt whatsoever that he held that Ashrama itself in the highest esteem if only from the use of such expressions as "YATIRAJA", "YATICAKRAVARTI", "YATISARVABHAUMA". It is also most appropriate and fraught with great significance that the origins of modern Srīvaishnavism are to be traced to the identical source. 

Though we have not had any accurate account of the origin of such institutions as Mutts, there can be little doubt about their nature and purpose. They have always found their source in the magnetic and dynamic spiritual personalities of some great saint. The establishment of Mutts merely represents to us the hankering of the human mind to perpetuate and propagate whatever is for the good. While it is also true that most human institutions have tended [[ix]] as if by some irresistible law to deteriorate and degenerate, the Vaishnavite Mutts in South India such as Sri Parakāla Mutt and Sri Ahobila Mutt have proved and established a vitality and strength sufficient to overcome any such tendencies. To-day we are proud of all our Mutts and also of those who adorn them as their heads. 

Such Mutts are real corporations also. They may be described too as seminaries. They may be defined in terms of Gurukula. They are in essence also moving Universities for the spread of learning, secular and spiritual. They are also capable of being regarded as being great spiritual streams, taking their origin on some sacred peak and receiving during their course many tributaries making more and more for the breadth, depth and beauty of the great river. That is what Sri Parakāla Mutt has been demonstrated to be, albeit in these few pages of mere recorded facts. 

It is a matter for infinite pride and satisfaction that this Mutt has been traced historically and directly to Sri Vedanta Desika and through him to Bhagavad Rāmānuja, not to go any further. It is a matter for even more importance and interest that the great founder of this Mutt was the direct disciple of Sri Vedanta Desika and was, beyond all questions, his spiritual son. If Sri Vedanta Desika attained the title and distinction of "Sarva Tantra Swatantra ". this great disciple was claimed and acclaimed as "BRAHMATANTRA SWATANTRA " even by his own Acharya. More than all, the deity of Sri Lakshmi-

X 

Hayagriva worshipped daily even to-day at the Mutt at Mysore was the very Mūrti whom Sri Desika cherished and worshipped during his life even as, we are told, by Sri Bhagavad Rāmānuja himself before him. This is forsooth the truest kind of hierarchy. 

While reading the brief accounts of one great saint after another who have during all these centuries sat on this pontifical throne, one cannot help putting to himself the question whether the world has ever witnessed such a wonderful apostolic succession. If indeed, the good fortune had been given to all the great and saintly souls to worship each in succession that very Hayagriva-Mūrti which was worshipped centuries ago by the forbears of Srivaishnavism, what of the unique characteristic and, if I may add, good fortune of the Deity itself to have come to be so highly and devotedly worshipped by such a distinguished line of great saints. 

Even in these days of rank materialism, there are still thousands of true and sincere Hindus who are found to cherish in their heart of hearts the ancient ideals of life and learning. To all of them the sight of this record of valuable and great contributions to Srīvaishnavism made successively by the occupants of the Gadi in this Mutt, is a record of which any human institution may well be proud. If one thing in this booklet strikes the reader more than any other, it is the intensive effort made by so many of the Swāmis to travel all over the country with the Gods of their worship and their spiritual 

xi 

fire and light, carrying as it were to the doorway of every devotee all the benefits and blessings of Srīvaishnavaitic faith and philosophy. Times are changing, and indeed very fast. To-day and perhaps more than ever before, the need for such administration and propaganda is absolutely necessary. Will our present Swāmi not take into His gracious consideration at least the example so gloriously set by so many distinguished predecessors of his? One cannot be sure whether such a desideratum has not at the present day come to be even a duty. No institution even as no man, can live and function beneficially without increasing measures of adaptation to environment. Apart from travelling through the country there are other more obvious modern methods of teaching and propaganda. What is sorely needed at the present hour is to reach the mind of the rising generation and inform their minds and stimulate their interest concerning the vast and valuable spiritual treasures in Srīvaishnavaitic religion and philosophy, to lead and guide them, to enrich their souls and secure their salvation, here and hereafter. 

The author of this treatise has concluded with a glowing tribute to His Holiness the present Swāmi. I have had the pleasure and privilege of coming into contact personally with that great saint. I well remember even now an occasion when on one of my visits to him, possibly the very first, I found him surrounded on all four sides by scores of books; and I voluntarily burst out "Tad hi Tapas-Tad hi 

15 

xii 

Tapaḥ ("That indeed is Tapas; That indeed is Tapas") standing reminded there and then of that Upanishadic exclamation, about Svadhyaya and Pravachana-about self-study and propagation of knowledge. His Holiness has already by his ideal devotion and strenuous life taken his proper place in the respect, devotion and affection of the public. To see him worship the Gods of his Mutt, the Gods of his heart, is to stand bedazed into a realisation of what alone is ideal worship. I have been struck every time I witnessed the personal performance by him of the daily worship by an overwhelming sense that His Holiness has, by his great understanding, devotion, sincerity and realisation, made the act of worship a veritable fine art filling us with an intense appreciation of the idealistic beauty and transcendence of such worship. 

Above all His Holiness seems to me to be one of the greatest economists of time and he is one of the very few I have come across who will be willing and able to render a good and satisfactory account of the twenty-four hours of each day which he believes he gets and holds in trust for the discharge of the functions connected with his great and holy office. I may also here declare my experience that whenever I have had the privilege of visiting the Mutt and worshipping there, my mind used to be irresistibly taken back to all the great saints and sages who have made the institution what it is and make me feel that somehow the spiritual personality and presence of all the great sages and saints in the 

xiii 

apostolic hierarchy of the Mutt is still there capable of being felt and even imbibed by those who have a responsive spirit. 

Such a Mutt and such a Swami should be a sufficient guarantee for the advancement of Srivaishnavism in South India.

ಮಠಗಳ ಮೂಲವು 

ಇದಮಿತ್ಥಂ'' ಎಂಬಷ್ಟು ಖಚಿತವಾಗಿ ಗೋಚರಿಸುವ ವಿವರಗಳೂ ಮತ್ತು ಪೂರ್ವ ಚರಿತ್ರಗಳೂ ನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೂ, ಮಠಗಳ ಸ್ವಭಾವವೂ ಮತ್ತು ಅವುಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿತವಾದ ಉದ್ದೇಶವೂ ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗಿವೆ. ಯಾವುದೊಂದು ಮಠವನ್ನೇ ಆಗಲಿ, ತಪಸ್ವಿಗಳೂ ಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳೂ ಆದ ಸಾಧುವರೇಣ್ಯರೇ ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಿರುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಶ್ರೇಯಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಸಾಧಕವಾದ ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ ತತ್ತ್ವಗಳನ್ನು ಜನರಿಗೆ ಬೋಧಿಸಿ ಕೃತಾರ್ಥರನ್ನಾಗಿ ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆಂಬ ಮಹತ್ತರವಾದ ಆಕಾಂಕ್ಷೆಯೇ ಮಠಗಳು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿತವಾದುದರ ಮೂಲ, ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯವಾದ ಯಾವುದೋ ನಿಯಮಕ್ಕಧೀನವಾಗಿ ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಬಹು ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯವುಗಳು ಖಿಲವಾಗಿ ಕ್ಷೀಣದೆಸೆಗೆ ಬಂದಿದ್ದರೂ, ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಭಾರತದ ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲ ಮಠ, ಶ್ರೀ ಅಹೋಬಲಮಠ, ಮುಂತಾದ ವೈಷ್ಣವಮಠಗಳು ಮಾತ್ರ, ಆ ಬಗೆಯ ಪ್ರವೃತ್ತಿಗೆ ಒಳಗಾಗದೆ ಅಂತಹ ಪ್ರವೃತ್ತಿಯನ್ನೇ ನಿಗ್ರಹಿಸಿ ಪರಿಶೋಭಿಸುವ ಮಟ್ಟಿನ ಚೈತನ್ಯವನ್ನೂ, ಶಕ್ತಿ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯಗಳನ್ನೂ ಪಡೆದಿವೆ. ಈ ಮಠಗಳನ್ನೂ, ಅವುಗಳ ಅಧಿಷ್ಠಾತೃಗಳಾಗಿರುವ ಪೀಠಾಧಿಪತಿಗಳನ್ನೂ ನೋಡಿ, ನಾವೆಲ್ಲರೂ ಇಂದು ಹೆಮ್ಮೆಪಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೆ. 

ಇಂತಹ ಮಠಗಳು ಸಾಂಘಿಕರೂಪದ ಜ್ಞಾನ ಪ್ರಸಾರಕೇಂದ್ರಗ ಎಂದು ಧಾರಾಳವಾಗಿ ಹೇಳಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ. ಅವು ಗುರುಕುಲಗಳೆಂದೂ ಹೇಳಬಹುದು. ವಾಸ್ತವವಾಗಿ ಅವು ಪರಾಪರಾ ವಿದ್ಯೆಗಳೆರಡನ್ನೂಎಂದರೆ ಆಧ್ಯಾತ್ಮಿಕ ಮತ್ತು ವ್ಯಾವಹಾರಿಕ ವಿದ್ಯೆಗಳೆರಡನ್ನೂ ಹರಡುವ ಚರ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳಂತಿವೆ. ಪವಿತ್ರವಾದೊಂದು ಶಿಖರದಿಂದ ಪ್ರವಹಿಸುತ್ತ, ಅನೇಕ ಉಪನದಿಗಳ ಜಲರಾಶಿಗೆ ಆಶ್ರಯ ಕೊಟ್ಟು ಪಾತ್ರ ವಿಸ್ತರವನ್ನೂ ಆಳವನ್ನೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತ ಮುಂದುವರಿಯು ತಿರುವ ಪಾರಮಾರ್ಥಿಕ ಮಹಾನದಿಗಳೆಂದೂ ಅವುಗಳನ್ನು ವರ್ಣಿಸಬಹು ದಾಗಿದೆ. ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲ ಮಠವೂ ಅದೇ ರೀತಿಯದೆಂಬುದು, ಈ ಗ್ರಂಥ ದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಗ್ರಹವಾಗಿರುವ ಸಂಗತಿಗಳಿಂದ ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟವಾಗಿ ವ್ಯಕ್ತವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಶ್ರೀ ವೇದಾಂತದೇಶಿಕರಿಗೂ, ಅವರ ಮೂಲಕ ಭಗವದ್ರಾ ಮಾನುಜಾಚಾರ್ಯರಿಗೂ, ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲ ಮಠದ ಪೀಳಿಗೆಯನ್ನು

ಮೈಸೂರು ನಗರದ ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲಮಠದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರತಿದಿನವೂ ಪೂಜಾದಿ ಕೈಂಕರ್ಯಗಳು ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ ಹಯಗ್ರೀವ ಮೂರ್ತಿ ಯವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹವು ಶ್ರೀ ವೇದಾಂತದೇಶಿಕರು ಯಾವಜೀವವೂ ಪೂಜಿ ಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ವಿಗ್ರಹ; ಅವರಿಗೆ ಪೂರ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ಶ್ರೀ ರಾಮಾನುಜಾಚಾರ್ಯರೇ ಸ್ವಯಂ ಪೂಜಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ವಿಗ್ರಹ, ಹೀಗೆ ನಡೆದು ಬಂದಿದೆ, ಆಚಾರ್ಯ ಶಿಷ್ಯ ಪ್ರಶಿಷ್ಯ ಪರಂಪರೆಯ ಪೀಳಿಗೆ, 

ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲಮಠದ ಪೀಠವನ್ನಲಂಕರಿಸುತ್ತ ಬಂದ ಸಾಧು ವರೇಣ್ಯರ ಅನುಕ್ರಮವೂ, ಅವರ ದಿವ್ಯ ಚರಿತಕ್ಕೆ ಸಂಬಂಧಪಟ್ಟ ಸಂಗತಿ ಗಳೂ ಈ ಗ್ರಂಥದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಕ್ಷೇಪವಾಗಿ ಸೂಚಿತವಾಗಿವೆಯಷ್ಟೆ. ಅವು ಗಳನ್ನು ಓದಿದ ಯಾರೊಬ್ಬರ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೇ ಆಗಲಿ “ ಮತ್ತೆಲ್ಲಿಯಾದರೂ ಈ ಬಗೆಯ ಮಹಾನುಭಾವರ ಪರಂಪರೆಯು ಪ್ರಪಂಚದಲ್ಲಿ ಕಂಡು ಬಂದಿದೆಯೆ ” ಎಂಬ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಯು ಹೊಳೆಯದಿರಲಾರದು. ಶ್ರೀವೈಷ್ಣವ ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತ ಪ್ರತಿಪಾದಕರಾದ ಮೂಲಪುರುಷರಿಂದ ಹಿಡಿದು ಇಂದಿನ ವರೆಗೂ ಅನೇಕ ಶತಮಾನಗಳ ಕಾಲ ಇಷ್ಟು ಮಂದಿ ಸಾಧುವರೇಣ್ಯರಾದ ಮಹಾನುಭಾವರ ಸುಯೋಗವು ಈ ಹಯಗ್ರೀವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಕ್ಕೆ ಪೂಜೆ ಮಾಡುವುದಾಗಿದ್ದ ಮೇಲೆ, ಇಷ್ಟು ಮಂದಿ ಪರಂಪರಾ ಗತರಾದ ಸಾಧುವರೇಣ್ಯರಾದ ಮಹಾನುಭಾವರ ಭಕ್ತಿಯುತವಾದ ಪೂಜೆ ಯನ್ನು ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸುತ್ತ ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ ಹಯಗ್ರೀವ ಮೂರ್ತಿ ಯವರ ಸುಯೋಗವೂ ಎಷ್ಟೆಂದು ನನ್ನ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ತೋರುತ್ತಿದೆ.

ಬಹುತರವಾಗಿ ನಾಸ್ತಿಕತೆಯೇ ವಿಜೃಂಭಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ಈಗಿನ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೂಡ, ಆಸ್ತಿಕ ಲಕ್ಷಣವಾದ ಪ್ರಾಚೀನ ಸಂಪ್ರದಾಯ ಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಆಧ್ಯಾತ್ಮಿಕ ವಿದ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ವಿಶ್ವಾಸವುಳ್ಳ ಅಭಿಮಾನ ಶಾಲಿಗಳಾದ ಲಕೋಪಲಕ್ಷ ಹಿಂದುಗಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರೆಲ್ಲರೂ ಈ ಗ್ರಂಥದಲ್ಲಿ ಸೂಚಿತವಾಗಿರುವಂತೆ ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲ ಮಠದ ಪೀಠಾಧಿ ಕಾರಿಗಳ ಪರಂಪರೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬೆಳಗಿದ ಮತ್ತು ಬೆಳಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಮಹಾನು ಭಾವರಿಂದ ಶ್ರೀ ವೈಷ್ಣವ ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತಕ್ಕೆ ಸಮರ್ಪಿತವಾಗಿರುವ ಸೇವೆಯು ಮಾನವ ಕಲ್ಪಿತವಾದ ಯಾವ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಯಾದರೂ ಹೆಮ್ಮೆ ಪಡುವಂತಿದೆ ಯೆಂದು ಹರ್ಷಿಸುವುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂದೇಹವಿಲ್ಲ. ಈ ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಓದಿದರೆ, ಇತರ ಸಂಗತಿಗಳೆಲ್ಲಕ್ಕಿಂತಲೂ ಮಿಗಿಲಾಗಿ ಮನದಟ್ಟಾಗುವ ಸಂಗತಿ ಯೊಂದಿದೆ; ಈ ಮಠದ ಅನೇಕ ಮಂದಿ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರು, ತಾವು ಆರಾಧಿಸುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ ಹಯಗ್ರೀವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಯವರ ವಿಗ್ರಹವನ್ನೂ ಮತ್ತು ಇತರ ವಿಗ್ರಹಗಳನ್ನೂ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು ನಾಡಿನ ನಾನಾ ಸ್ಥಳ ಗಳಿಗೂ ದಯಮಾಡಿ, ಭಕ್ತಕೋಟಿಯ ಬಾಗಿಲಿಗೆ ಪಾರಮಾರ್ಥಿಕ ತೇಜಕ್ಕೂ ಜ್ಞಾನಜ್ಯೋತಿಯೂ ಬಂದಂತೆ ವರ್ತಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ವೈಷ್ಣವ ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತವನ್ನೂ ಸಂಪ್ರದಾಯಗಳನ್ನೂ ಭಕ್ತಕೋಟಿಗೆ ಬೋಧಿಸಿ ಕೃಪೆ ಮಾಡಿರುವುದೇ ಆ ಸಂಗತಿ. ಕಾಲವು ಬಹು ಶೀಘ್ರವಾಗಿ ಮಾರ್ಪಡು ತ್ತಿದೆ. ಆದಕಾರಣ ಹಿಂದೆ ಮತ್ತಾವಾಗಲೂ ಅವಶ್ಯವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ದಷ್ಟು ಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಈ ಬಗೆಯ ಧರ್ಮಬೋಧೆಯು ಇಂದು ಅಗತ್ಯವಾಗಿದೆ. ಈಗಿನ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರೂ ತಮ್ಮ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಪೀಠಾಧಿಕಾರಿಗಳಾದ ಅನೇಕ ಮಂದಿ ಗಳ ಭವ್ಯತರವಾದ ಮೇಲ್ಪಂಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನೇ ತಾವೂ ಅನುಸರಿಸಿ ಅವ ರಂತೆಯೇ ಧರ್ಮಬೋಧೆ ಮಾಡಲು ಪ್ರವಾಸವನ್ನು ಕೈಕೊಂಡು ಕೃಪೆ ಮಾಡುವರೆಂದು ನಾವು ಪ್ರಾರ್ಥಿಸಿ ನಿರೀಕ್ಷಿಸಬಹುದಲ್ಲವೆ? ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳ ವರು ಹಾಗೆ ಕೃಪೆ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಾದುದು ಅವಶ್ಯ ಕರ್ತವ್ಯವೆಂದು ತೋರುವ ಸಮಯವು ಸನ್ನಿಹಿತವಾಗಿದೆಯೆಂದು ಕೂಡ ಹೇಳಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ. ಸನ್ನಿವೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊಂದಿಕೊಂಡು ವರ್ತಿಸುವುದಕ್ಕೆ ಸಾಧಕವಾಗುವಂತೆ ತಕ್ಕ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಗಳನ್ನು ಕಲಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಲ್ಲದೆ, ಯಾವ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಯಾಗಲಿ ಅಥವಾ

ಯಾವ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯಾಗಲಿ ಉತ್ತಮಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಾಳುವುದು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ. ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲೆಲ್ಲ ಸಂಚಾರಮಾಡುವುದರ ಜೊತೆಗೆ, ಈಗಿನ ಕಾಲದ ಇತರ ಬೋಧನ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಚಾರ ವಿಧಾನಗಳೂ ಇವೆ. ಇಂದು ಅತ್ಯಗತ್ಯವಾಗಿ ನೆರವೇರಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿರುವ ಕಾರ್ಯವೆಂದರೆ, ತರುಣರನ್ನು ಜಾಗೃತಿ ಗೊಳಿಸಿ, ಶ್ರೀ ವೈಷ್ಣವ ಮತದ ಮತ್ತು ಶ್ರೀವೈಷ್ಣವ ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತದ ಅಮೂಲ್ಯವಾದ ಮತ್ತು ಗಹನವಾದ ಜ್ಞಾನಭಂಡಾರದ ಪರಿಚಯವನ್ನು ಅವರಿಗೆ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟು, ಅವರಿಗೆ ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸಕ್ತಿಯುಂಟಾಗುವಂತೆಯ ಮತ್ತು ಅವರ ಜ್ಞಾನಾನುಭವಗಳು ವೃದ್ಧಿಯಾಗುವಂತೆಯೂ ಮಾಡುವ ಮತ್ತು ಐಹಿಕಾಯುತ್ಮಿಕ ವಿಚಾರಗಳೆರಡರಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಅವರು ಚರಿತಾರ್ಥ ರಾಗಲು ಸಾಧಕವಾಗುವ ಸನ್ಮಾರ್ಗ ಪ್ರದರ್ಶನ ಮಾಡುವ ಮಹತ್ತರ 

ಕಾರ್ಯ. 

ಈ ಗ್ರಂಥಕರ್ತರು, ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲಮಠದ ಈಗಿನ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರ ಮೇಲಿನ ಭಕ್ತಿ ವಿಶ್ವಾಸಪೂರ್ವಕವಾದ ಶ್ಲಾಘನೆಯ ಮಾತುಗಳಿಂದ ಗ್ರಂಥ ವನ್ನು ಮುಕ್ತಾಯಗೊಳಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ವಿರಕ್ತಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠರಾದ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರ ಪರಿಚಯಲಾಭದ ಸುಯೋಗವನ್ನು ನಾನು ಪಡೆದಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ನಾನು ಮೊಟ್ಟ ಮೊದಲನೆಯ ಸಾರಿ ಅವರನ್ನು ಸಂದರ್ಶಿಸಿದಾಗಲೋ ಅಥವಾ ಆ ತರುವಾಯವೋ ಕಂಡ ದೃಶ್ಯವು ಈಗಲೂ ನನ್ನ ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ಕಟ್ಟಿ ದಂತಿದೆ. ಆಗ್ಗೆ ಅವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಸುತ್ತಲೂ ಹಲವಾರು ಗ್ರಂಥಗಳನ್ನು ಹರಡಿಕೊಂಡು ವ್ಯಾಸಂಗಮಗ್ನರಾಗಿದ್ದರು. ಆ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಅವರ ಸಂದರ್ಶನ ಭಾಗ್ಯವು ನನಗೆ ಲಭಿಸಿದಾಗ, ನನ್ನ ಪರಿವೆಯೇ ಇಲ್ಲದಂತೆ ನನ್ನ ಮನಸ್ಸು “ ತದ್ಧಿತ ವಸ್ತ್ರದ್ಧಿ ತಪಸ್ ) ( ಅದೇ ತಪಸ್ಸು, ಅದೇ ತಪಸ್ಸು') ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಿಕೊಂಡಿತು ; ಸ್ವಾಧ್ಯಾಯ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರವಚನಗಳನ್ನು ಕುರಿತ ಉಪನಿಷತ್ತಿನ ಆ ಅಮರ ವಾಣಿಗಳನ್ನು ನಾನು ಸ್ಮರಣೆಗೆ ತಂದುಕೊಂಡು ಆನಂದಿಸಿದೆ. ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಅಸಾಧಾರಣವಾದ ಸ್ವಾಧ್ಯಾಯ ಪ್ರವಚನಗಳಿಂದಲೂ ಮತ್ತು ವಿರಕ್ತ ಜೀವನದಿಂದಲೂ ಶಿಷ್ಯಕೋಟಿಯ ಶ್ರೇಯಸ್ಸಿಗಾಗಿ ಶ್ರಮಿಸುತ್ತ, ಸಾರ್ವ ಜನಿಕರ ಭಕ್ತಿಗೌರವಗಳನ್ನೂ ಪ್ರೀತಿ ವಿಶ್ವಾಸಗಳನ್ನೂ ಗಳಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 

[[xxi]]

ಅವರು ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಆರಾಧಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ಮೂರ್ತಿಗಳ ಪೂಜೆಯನ್ನು ನೆರವೇರಿಸುವ ವಿಧಾನವನ್ನು ನೋಡಿದರೆ, ಭಕ್ತಿ ಪಾರವಶ್ಯದ ಆದರ್ಶ ಪೂಜಾವಿಧಾನವೂ ಹೇಗಿರುತ್ತದೆಂಬುದು ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಗೋಚರವಾಗಿ ಮೈಮರೆಯುವಂತಾಗುತ್ತದೆ; ಆನಂದಾಧಿಕ್ಯದಿಂದ ರೋಮಾಂಚನ ವುಂಟಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲ ಮಠದಲ್ಲಿ ಅವರಿಂದ ನಡೆಯುವ ಪೂಜೆಯನ್ನು ನೋಡುವ ಸುಯೋಗವು ಲಭಿಸಿದ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಂದು ಸಲವೂ, ನನಗೆ ಆ ಬಗೆಯ ಅನುಭವವುಂಟಾಗಿದೆ ; ಅಲ್ಲದೆ, ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಜ್ಞಾನ ಭಕ್ತಿಗಳ ಮತ್ತು ಶ್ರದ್ಧಾ ಸಾಕ್ಷಾತ್ಕಾರಗಳ ಪ್ರಭಾವ ದಿಂದ ಪೂಜೆಯನ್ನೇ ಒಂದು ಲಲಿತ ಕಲೆ ಯ ನ್ನಾಗಿ ಪರಿಣಾಮ ಗೊಳಿಸಿ ಪೂಜೆಯ ಸೊಬಗೂ ಮತ್ತು ಅದರ ಲೋ ಕೋ ತರ ಸ್ವಭಾವವೂ ಹೃದಯಂಗಮವಾಗಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಗೋಚರವಾಗುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 

ಎಲ್ಲಕ್ಕೂ ಮಿಗಿಲಾಗಿ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರು, ತಮ್ಮ ಕಾಲವನ್ನು ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಸದ್ವಿನಿಯೋಗ ಮಾಡಿ ಶ್ರೇಯೋಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಗ್ನ ರಾಗಿರುವ ಮಹನೀಯರಲ್ಲೊಬ್ಬರೆಂದು ನನ್ನ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಖಚಿತವಾಗಿ ತೋರಿಬಂದಿದೆ. ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರು ಒಂದು ಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನೂ ವ್ಯರ್ಥವಾಗಿ ಕಳೆಯುವವರಲ್ಲ. ಹೀಗೆ ಸತ್ಕಾಲಕ್ಷೇಪಮಾಡುವವರ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯು ತೀರ ಕಡಮೆಯೆಂದು ಹೇಳಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ. ತಮಗೆ ಲಭಿಸಿರುವ ಕಾಲವೆಲ್ಲ, ತಮ್ಮ ಪೀಠಾಧಿಕಾರಸಂಬಂಧವಾದ ನಾನಾ ಕರ್ತವ್ಯಗಳಿಗೂ ಮಾಸ ಲಾಗಿದ್ದು ತಾವು ಗುರುತರವಾದ ಆ ಕರ್ತವ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ನಿರ್ವಹಿಸ ಬೇಕೆಂಬುದೇ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರ ಆಕಾಂಕ್ಷೆ ಮತ್ತು ಸ್ಥಿರಸಂಕಲ್ಪ. ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಕಾಲಮಠಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದು ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳವರ ಪೂಜಾವಿಧಿಯನ್ನು ನೋಡುವ ಸುಯೋಗವು ನನಗೆ ಲಭಿಸಿದಾಗಲೆಲ್ಲ, ಶ್ರೀ ಮಠವನ್ನು ಹಿಂದಿನಿಂದಲೂ ಪುರೋಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿಗೊಳಿಸಲು ಶ್ರಮಿಸಿದ ವಿರಕ್ತಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠರಾದ ಮತ್ತು ತಪಸ್ವಿ ಗಳಾದ ಪೀಠಾಧಿಕಾರಿಗಳ ಅಂತರಾತ್ಮಗಳು ತಮ್ಮ ತೇಜಶ್ಯ ರೀರಗಳನ್ನು ಬೆಳಗುತ್ತ ಪೂಜಾಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಜಯಂಗೈದಿರುವಂತೆಯೇ ನನ್ನ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ತೋರಿ ಬಂದಿದೆ ; ಭಕ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ಅನುಸಂಧಾನ ಮಾಡಿದರೆ, ಅವರೆಲ್ಲರ 

[[xxii]]

ಕೃಪೆಗೂ ಪಾತ್ರವಾಗಿ ಅವರ ಸಾನ್ನಿಧ್ಯದ ಆನಂದಾನುಭವವುಂಟಾಗು ವುದು ಕೂಡ ಸಾಧ್ಯವೆಂಬ ಭಾವನೆಯು ನನಗುಂಟಾಗಿದೆ. 

ಇಂತಹ ಮಠವೂ, ಇಂತಹ ಮಹಾನುಭಾವರಾದ ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀಗಳ ವರೂ ಇರುವಲ್ಲಿ, ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಶ್ರೀವೈಷ್ಣವ ಮತದ ಪುರೋಭಿ ವೃದ್ಧಿ ಸಾಧನೆಯು ಏಕಪ್ರಕಾರವಾಗಿ ಮುಂದುವರಿದು ಶ್ರೇಯಸ್ಸು ಟಾಗುವುದೆಂಬುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಲೇಶಮಾತ್ರವೂ ಸಂದೇಹವೇ ಇಲ್ಲ.

THE first quarter of the 14th century of the Christian era had to witness an awful crisis in the history of South India which, had it been allowed to develop unchecked, would have sounded the death-knell of the Orthodox Hinduism of Ages. From such a development the ancient faith was saved by the rulers and saints inhabiting the regions in and near the borders of the countries which were included within the sway of the Hoysalas of Mysore. They not only saved it but revitalised it in such a manner that the age-long creed even to this day promises to survive the most terribly organised attacks, which may be planned against it, even in the coming centuries. 

> कलि-प्रणिधि-लक्षणैः कलित-शाक्य-लोकायितैस्  
तुरुष्क-यवनादिभिर् जगति **जृम्भमाणं** भयम् ।  
प्रकृष्ट-निज-शक्तिभिः प्रसभम् आयुधैः पञ्चभिः
क्षिति--त्रि-दश--रक्षकैः **क्षपय** रङ्गनाथ क्षणात् ॥ 22 ॥  
 श्रीमदभीतिस्तवः ॥ 

The crisis was caused by the blitz of Malik Kafur, which, before it reached the extreme end of the peninsula, left the realm of Hoysalas of Dwara Samudra a complete wreck, materially at least (for, the spiritual fire was there still burning as of old in the breasts of the inhabitants of the once prosperous country, which, within less than quarter of a century, blazed forth again as the result of the spiritual and organising [[2]] powers of the great Vidyaranya and his brother Sāyaṇācharya, the founders of Vijayanagar). 

Away in the south and the eastern regions below the Ghats, the renowned Śri Vaishnava saints and scholars, inhabiting the dominions which constituted the ancient Chola, and later, the wrecked Pandyan Empires, had helped preserve the ancient spiritual heritage of the land 

1) by their teachings, 
2) by the monumental works which they wrote, and 
3) by their own selfless, devoted and austere lives. 
   
Among such scholar saints of the Tamilnad, the most famous and revered personality was that of Śrī Vedantha Desika or Venkata Nātha (reference in "Alfonso de Albuquerque" "Rulers of India" Series) of Kancheepuram. 

When the Tamil land was exposed, at the opening of the second quarter of the 14th century of the Christian era, to a simultaneous and concerted attack by the armies of Muhammad Bin Tughlak from the north and those of the Sultans of Madura from the South, a creation of Malik Kafur,-a slaughter, unparalleled in the annals of that sacred and beautiful land, ensued. Out of the holocaust of human beings, a few, however, succeeded in effecting their escape with some of their monumental works and a few devoted followers. The most famous of these was Śrī Vedantha Desika, who, having heard of the security which had just been ensured to the Hoysala people by the might of the arms of Vira Ballāḷa III (A.D. 1292-1342), had, after a sojourn of 12 years as a fugitive in the remote village of Satyāgālam on the Cauvery (Coimbatore District), had made his way to Melkote (Thirunārāyaṇapuram in Mysore country, "Melnad"-as the Tamil people called it in contrast to their own country below the Ghats, "Keelnad "). There, as in Satyāgālam, in the midst of the most picturesque and peaceful environments, the great scholar-saint continued his work for a long time, which had been interrupted under the most tragic circumstances in his own native land. 

[[3]]

But, by this time, about the middle of the century, the determined assault on the Kannada country from the north, the east and the south, had been shattered by Hoysala Veera Ballāḷa III from his position at Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam in the south, operating against the Madura Sultans as well as the northern armies from Delhi, and by the newly established Vijayanagar Sovereign Hakka (Harihara I) and Kumāra Kampana, the former under the guidance of Sri Vidyaranya and the latter under that of Sāyaṇācharya, his brother. Thus, it was the Kannadiga Sovereigns to whom destiny allotted the task of preserving, and later enriching, the ancient faith and culture of the land. Under the ægis and the sheltering umbrella of the Vijayanagar Sovereigns, the culture and religion of the land once more began to show forth with added glory and lustre. Within the embrace of that Empire, the Advaita, Dvaita and Vishistadvaita systems of philosophy, under the respective teachers, developed [[4]] and flourished, unimpaired and unhampered by any unhealthy rivalries or jealousies. 

It may be said that Sri Vedantha Desika from Melkote carried on the work which had been started there two and half centuries ago by his predecessor in the spiritual hierarchy, Bhagavan Śrī Rāmānuja, for a long time before he returned to Kancheepuram and Srirangam. It is, indeed, a strange and predetermined destiny that that work should, to this day, after a lapse of nearly six centuries, be continued without interruption under the Gandabherunda of the Mysore Rulers, blessed by the occupants of the Gādi of Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Parakala Swāmies of Mysore, the Rajagurus, successors of the First Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar, the immediate successor of Śri Vedantha Desika in the spiritual pedigree of Śrī Rāmānuja (as far as the Vadagale-Acharyas are concerned) and founder of the Śri Brahmatantra Matha, originally in Kancheepuram and later at Thirupathi. 

Unbroken tradition has it that Śrī Rāmānuja got the gift of Sri Lakshmi Hayagriva's image, worshipped in the Brahmatantra Parakala Matha of Mysore, directly from Śrī Saraswati in recognition of the expounding of the Vishistadvaita system of philosophy before the assemblage of Pandits of Kashmir "Saraswati Peetham" about the beginning of the twelfth century, during his visit to that country, even as Śrī Sankaracharya, under similar circumstances, got the image of Sri Sharada herself three centuries earlier. From Śrī Rāmānuja the image of [[5]] Śrī Hayagriva and, with it, the spiritual succession, passed on to Tirukkurukkaippirān Pillān. From Śrī Puṇḍarīkāksha, a scion of that distinguished saint, who also had become the Rājaguru to the Vijayanagara Emperor, the image, with all attendant Imperial paraphernalia, passed on to Śrī Vedantha Desikar and from him to Śrī Periya Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar at Kancheepuram. 

By the close of the 14th century A.D. the Empire of Vjiayanagar had been established on secure foundations for over half a century by the concerted efforts of the sovereigns and their ministers and army leaders, who combined undisputed spiritual power with their profound and unerring statesmanship. The march. northward of the Empire was continued as far as the Mahanadi, embracing the Kingdom of Kondavīdu. The advance, too, southward, as far as the Kanyakumāri and the extension towards both the coasts about the same period secured to the Peninsula an uninterrupted revival of power and prosperity. Princes and peasants, army leaders and Dandanāyakas (Viceroys) vied with one another in the attempt to revive the glory of the past in the field of literature, philosophy, the arts, as also in practical devotion. Amongst the last was the blessed Śrī Yaduraya or Vijayaraya who, during his pilgrimage to the south, to Yadavādri or Melukote, after worshipping Vindhyachala Vāsini (the Goddess who prepared the ground for the avatar of Lord Sri Krishna, his ancestor), happened to come into contact on the way from Vindhyachal with Śrī Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar at Thirupathi,  [[6]] the holy shrine of Lord Sri Venkatesha. The Jeeyar, having founded a Mutt in Conjeevaram in 1360 A.D. (Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XXIV, Part vii, July 1940, pp. 318326) had by now (1379 A.D.) removed his headquarters to Thirupathi. Its remoteness from turmoil, the grandeur of the surrounding hilly country, and its being the resort of all classes and communities, hailing from the most distant regions of India, of Marathi-speaking peoples, of Kannadigars, of the Andhras, of the Bengalis, of the Hindusthanis, of the Punjabis, of Kashmiris, and of course, the Tamilians, all these considerations prompted Śri Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar to stay there, at Thirupathi, permanently ministering to the spiritual cravings of Hindus from all Hindusthan, who had been kept in terror and dismay by the kaleidoscopic changes happening over three centuries. Moreover, there was no longer the need felt for a continuous stay in the Tamilnad, which had been the home of ever-raging religious controversies between the various schools of thought like the Dvaita, Advaita and Vishistādvaita, etc. The age of controversies had passed. Śrī Vedāntha Desika, Śrī Pillai Lokāchārya, Śrī Vidyaranya, Śrīmat Akshobhya Theertha and others all had definitely succeeded in effecting the final settlement of their respective systems. The age of Bhakti and the practice of devotion and the unhindered development of gnyānam had ensued, thanks to the peace and security guaranteed by the Vijayanagar Sovereigns to the southern peoples. [[7]] 

Thirupathi was away from the regions of controversies. Added to this, Sannyasins, having discarded family ties, and uninfluenced, therfore by consideration of patronage, favour or disfavour of men in power, and such, had by this time come to enjoy the confidence and esteem of people more than the Grihasthas, however much learned they might be. Śrī Vidyaraṇya, by assuming the Sanyasashramam, had acquired greater power and influence and was able to command the devotion of Emperors in a far higher degree than their grihastha ministers like Madhavamantri and other members of the cabinet, not to speak of his own brother, the great Sāyaṇācharya, the commentator of the Vedas and the Minister and Adviser of Śrī Kumāra Kampana. Thus it was that the Brahmatantra Matha at Thirupathi became the rallying centre of all conditions of men and women who had elected to tread the path of Bhakti and Prapatti. 

The great Yaduraya, who might have held the exalted position in the regions of the Godavari as a Bhoopala", having acquired the blessings of Śrī Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar and the sacraments of the Śri Vaishnava faith, decided to make the Mysore country, to which he was appointed Viceroy, (Daṇḍanayaka) his own home. Having become the Lord of Mysore (1399 A.D.), he directed himself to the task of furthering the practice of the Vaishnava faith in his own realm while consolidating his dominion. One of his first acts in this direction was the construction of the gateway (unfinished [[8]] Rajagopuram) at Melkote, the great centre of Śrī Vaishnava faith in Mysore, which had now acquired the position hitherto held by Srirangam and Kancheepuram in the cult of temple worship, which forms still an integral part of the practice of Śri Vaishnava faith. In a poem which Śri Vedantha Desika has composed in memory of the connections of Śrī Rāmānuja with the great religious centres, Thirupathi, Srirangam, Kancheepuram, Thirunārāyaṇapuram (Melkote), the "Divyadesha Mangaḷānu śāsanam," he has characterised the last, "Yadavādri" (Melkote) as the most favoured of Divya-Deshams by Śrī Rāmānuja who sojourned there for nearly a decade. 

Amongst the non-controversial works attributed to Brahmatantra Swatantra Swami was "The Divya Sūri Stotram", composed to enable the Bhaktas to cherish constantly the memories of the ancient saints and Acharyas of the faith. In recognition of his services to the faith, Lord Sri Venkatesha appeared, it is said, in Brahmatantra Swatantra Swami's dream and commanded him to take up the supervision of the management (Śrī Kāryam) of His shrine. and regulate also the services to be conducted therein in accordance with the Śrī Vaishnava Sampradayam as had been laid down by Śrī Rāmānuja. The connection established by Śrī Brahmatantra, at this time, between the Royal Family of Mysore and the Thirumalai Shrine is still perpetuated-eternally-by the great lamp endowed by the Rulers of Mysore which is kept burning by them all through these centuries in that shrine. The establishment of this connection was the crowning [[9]] work accomplished by the great Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar. May the lamp, the symbol of the Sanathana Dharma, and may the Yadava Family of Mysore which kindled the lamp continue like this for ever and ever in ever-increasing lustre ! 

### Sri Dwiteeya Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar 

To continue the work which had been entrusted to him by Śri Vedantha Desika and Lord Śrī Venkatesha, Śri Brahmatantra Swatantra appointed as his successor in the Gadi, Śrī Perarulaliyan (formerly a most distinguished exponent of the Advaita system hailing from the north, whom after a disputation lasting seven days in Conjeevaram he succeeded in overcoming and whom, at his own request and at the command of Sri Venkatesha deity, he converted to the Vishistādvaitam creed). Perarulaliyan (that is, Varada Raja) had now become "Śrī Vāthsya Vedantha Rāmānuja Swāmin ог Dvithiya Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar". 

Another work of great importance accomplished by Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar was the organisation and equipment of a Pustakabhāndāgaram in the Matha which he had founded in Conjeevaram in 1360 A.D. The great Library naturally came to contain within it the several hundreds of books which his successor and former disciple before conversion had brought with him. It must be presumed that the hundreds of disciples by whom the distinguished scholar from the north was accompanied, now became his disciples too. [[10]] 

Orthodox Śri Vaishnavas are enjoined to regulate their lives so as to conform to what has been described as the "Panchakāla Patha". Sannyasins, free from every other concern, were naturally able to tread this path. In consonance with the spirit of the rule they were bound to do everything possible 

(1) to help their disciples to redeem themselves by receiving the "Pancha Samskāram" or "Samāshrayanam"; 

(2) the expounding of Śrī Bhāsbya, Sreemath Rahasyatrayasara, Śrī Bhagavadvishayam, Śrī Bhagavad Geeta, Upanishads and allied works on the Siddhantha; 

(3) the production of further works calculated to expound the intricacies in and simplify the earlier voluminous works on the same; 

(4) the delivering of Lectures on the Ithihasas and the Purāṇas; 

(5) and, more than anything else, helping the seeker after salvation to offer "Sharanagati" or "Bharanyasam" or "Prapatti" to God; 

(6) making journeys to sacred places and to the Rajasthānams, if invited, for the performance of what may be called the "Dharma Digvijayam", whenever possible. 

Kings, chiefs and wealthy persons co-operated in such work and rendered every possible support. Royal patronage came to be accorded to such distinguished Swamies during the epoch of the Vijayanagar Emperors. If the sovereigns who founded the first Vijayanagar dynasty granted such patronage [[11]] to Acharyas like Śrī Vidyāraṇya, whose successors became their family Gurus, later Vijayanagar Sovereigns extended such patronage not only to their own family Gurus (Grihasthas) the Tātāchāryas, they ungrudgingly showered the same on Maṭhādhipathies of other sects also. Why, they even showed similar favour to the Portuguese and to the Muslims. This spirit of tolerance has always been the characteristic feature of the Hindu faith. 

Expounding the works written by Śrī Alavandar (Yamunacharya), Śrī Bhāshyakarar, Śrī Sudarsana Bhattar and Śrī Vedantha Desika itself was just enough to keep the Swamies of the Brahmatantra Mutt fully engaged during the pretty long lives which most of them lived. From the first Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar, the founder, up to Śrī Jnānābdhi Brahmatantra Swatantra Swami, there were fifteen occupants of the seat of Brahmatantra (1360-1600), a period of two and half centuries. 

### Sri Jnanabdhi Brahmatantra Swatantra Swami 

Śrī Jnānābdhi Brahmatantra Swatantra Swami is credited to have made a most important addition to the library of Śrī Vaishnava Philosophical Literature through his disciple, Śri Ranga Rāmānuja Swāmi who, at the instance of his Acharya, wrote the following works among others: 

(1) Bhāva Prakāsika, 

(2) Dashopanishad Bhashyam, 

(3) Vishaya Vakya Deepikai, 

(4) Rāmānuja Siddhanta Sāra Sangraham.12 

Another disciple of this Swami, a Grihastha Acharya, Vāthsya Ahobalāchārya Swāmi, also wrote explanatory works relating to Śrī Bhagavad Vishayam. It was this Śrī Jnānābdhi Brahmatantra Swatantra Parakāla Swami, who administered the sacraments to the great Śrī Rāja Odeyar of Mysore, who secured the independent existence of his realm from the suzerainty of Vijayanagar Emperors. 

The twelfth king, Śrī Mahārāja Ranadheera Kantheerava Narasimha Rāja Odeyar (1639-1660) is stated to have received the "Śrī Vaishnava Deeksha" at the hands of Śrī Varada Vedantha Swāmi I, the seventeenth in succession from the First Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar. Śrī Mahārāja Śrī Chikkadevarāja Odeyar (1673-1704) is stated to have commanded that the entire Ursu community should receive Chakrānkita and observe Śrī Vaishnava ceremonials. 

### Sri Periya Parakala Swami 

With the advent, to headship of the Mutt, of Śrī Periya Parakāla Swāmi, the twenty-first in succession from the first Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyar, an important change came over the destiny of the Mutt. Śrī Dodda Krishnaraja Odeyar of Mysore was successful in securing the removal of the headquarters of the Mutt to Srirangapatnam (the Capital of Mysore till 1799) from Thirupathi, the reason being the perfect security which prevailed in the Mysore country, earned for it by the wisdom [[13]] and power of Śrī Chikkadevarāja Odeyar (1673-1704), the illustrious ancestor of Sri Dodda Krishnarāja Odeyar (1714-1731). It might be that the unsettled conditions due to the Moghul-Mahratha conflicts in the Dekhan prompted Śrī Dodda Krishnarāja Odeyar to persuade the Swami to remove definitely to Mysore once for all from Tirumalai Thirupathi. Swāmis appointed by the heads of the Mutt in Mysore, however, continued to remain in the Mutt at Thirupathi hill to conduct the pooja of Śri Hayagrīva and Śrī Nigamantha Mahā- Desika, installed there by the First Brahmatantra Swatantra and to minister to the wants of the pilgrims during their stay on the hill. (Later on this practice of appointing an Agent Swami was given up.) It is no exaggeration to say that Sri Periya Brahmatantra Swatantra Parakāla Swami (1655-1738) occupies as important a place in Śrī Vaishnava hierarchy as that held by Śrī Rāmānuja in his time and also by Sri Vedantha Desika 

1) by the voluminous works which he wrote, and  
2) by his wide travels over South India, expounding the Sastras and restoring the temples and temple worship wherever decay had set in. 

When he succeeded to the Asthanam of Brahmatantra Swatantra in 1677 A.D. in his twenty-second year, he brought to the Mutt the image of Sri Lakshmi Nārāyaṇa, his family God, with him, to be worshipped along with that of Śri Hayagrīva. In the course of his fateful journey to Mysore, after his travels in the north, Sri Periya Parakalar is [[14]] said to have been met by the Emperor Aurangzeb, who not only revered him for the pre-eminent position he had attained by his scholarship and rank of Royal Guru of Mysore, but also bestowed some special honours upon the Swami, such as those which were the exclusive privilege of the Moghul Sovereigns. 

Śrī Periya Parakala Swami was the son of Śrī Srinivasa Desika, the great-grandson of the celebrated Appalachārya Swāmi of Ghānagiri (Penukonda), who had attained fame as the author of "Sara Prakāsika ". Śrī Srinivasa assumed Sannyasa and, having ascended the Gadi of Śrī Brahmatantra Swatantra at Thirupathi, assumed the name Śrī Varada Vedantha Yogindra. Śrī Srinivasa's son, Śri Thiruvenkatacharya, Kulaguru of Kempe Gowda III of Magadi (p. 16, Ann. Report, 1922, Mysore Archæological Department) assumed Sannyāsam from his father and having ascended the Gadi of the Brahmatantra Parakala Mutt at Thirupathi, assumed the name "Śrī Periya Parakāla Swāmi”. 

Among the works attributed to him, the most important are the following:-

The most reputed of all the contemporary Śrī Vaishnava Acharyas of the Tamil Nad of the time, [[15]] Śri Valla Iyengar offered his obeisance to the great Swāmi composing a verse (as was the custom of the time) in which he says that it was "by the accumulation of meritorious works of his own past lives that he was destined to worship at the feet of the Swāmi, who alone had the power of destroying hell and whose constant companion was Lord Śrī Krishna." Śri Periya Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi was succeeded in 1738 A.D. by 

### Sri Srinivasa Parakala Swami. 

He adorned the Peetham for fourteen years (1751). 

Amongst the works he wrote were:- 

(1) Lakshmyupaya Thatvadeepam, 

(2) Nyasa Prakāsikā, 

(3) Nyasa Prakāsika Vivrithi, 

(4) Parakala Mangalam, 

(5) Parakala Vaibhava Prakāsika. 

Śrī Srinivasa Parakāla Swāmi I, was followed in the Peetham by Sri Vedanta Brahmatantra Parakala Swami I. He was born in 1712 A.D. in Holavanahalli on the banks of the Jayamangala, and by his erudition, piety and the quiet and unassuming work which he had been performing in the small place, attracted the most learned men who resorted to him to acquire further knowledge and enlightenment. Having received the fourth Ashramam in A.D. 1759, he was raised to the succession to the Holy seat and filled it with distinction for twenty years. 

His disciple Sri Srinivasa II, belonging to Thirunarāyaṇapuram (Melkote), born in 1705 A.D., 

16 

succeeded to the Gādi at a very late age in A.D. 1779 and filled that office for only a year. As his end was approaching he sent for Śrī Rāmānuja Brahmatantra Swāmi and appointed him his successor in the Peetham. 

### Sri Ramanuja Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

This great sage and Yogin was born in A.D. 1709. He was the son of Śrī Thirumalacharya, who was a very near relation of Śrī Srinivāsa or Śrī Thiruvengadachariar, who became Śrī Periya Parakala Swāmi. A native of Bagepalli, he happened to take up his abode in Kumbakonam, where he received the Chakrānkana and Mantrams from Śrī Thirumalai Krishnamacharya, a direct disciple of Śrī Periya Parakalar. He studied all the Sastras and Vedantha and received Bharaṇyasam at the feet of Sri Srinivāsa Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi I. Once, when he happened to visit Thirupathi during Brahmotsavam, he fell ill and despairing of his life, received Sannyasam (in his 24th year, 1733 A.D.), even as a Brahmacharin, at the hands of Śri Brahmatantra Jeeyar who lived in the Mutt at Thirupathi conducting the daily services in the Mutt. But he recovered from his illness and continued to discharge all the duties attaching to that asramam, teaching and spreading the sacred lore for a period of thirty-six years. When he had attained his sixtyninth year, he was called upon by Śrī Abhinava Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala Swami (Melkote) to ascend the Gādi of the Mutt at Srirangapatnam in A.D. 1779. He continued to reside for a [[17]] considerable period in Srirangapatnam, i.e., till A.D. 1791 administering the sacraments and sacred lore to Śrī Mahārāņi Lakshammaṇṇiyavaru, but during the trouble which ensued in the period of Tippu Sultan, culminating in the wars with the Mahrathas, the Nizam and the British, the Swami, at the request of Śrī Maharani Lakshammaṇniyavaru, removed himself to Thirupathi. After the fall of Srirangapatam (1799) he returned and having crowned Śrī Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, King of Mysore, repaired to Krishnapuram in T. Narasipur Taluk, having chosen Śrī Krishṇamāchārya, afterwards Śrī Ghantavatāra Parakala Swami to be his successor in the asthanadhipatyam on his demise, assuming himself the role of Virakta Sannyasin. He lived in Krishṇāpuram for another ten years till 1810. It may be added that Śrī Rāmānuja Parakala before he left for Thirupathi, with his divine vision and strange foresight, advised Purniah, Dewan, to build the temple of Śrī Sweta Varaha at Mysore to serve as the nucleus of the future Mysore State. 

### Sri Brahmatantra Ghantavara Parakala Swami 

It was the beauty of character and person and piety, coupled with extraordinary scholarship of Śrī Krishṇāmācharya, which made Śrī Rāmānuja Parakāla recommend Śrī Krishnamacharya (of Nallur on the banks of the Pinakini in Penukonda Taluk) to Śri Mahārāņi Lakshammaṇṇiyavaru for the succession, when he himself retired to Krishṇāpuram. He named Śrī Krishnamacharya as Śrī [[18]] Ghantavatāra," a a name of Śrī Vedantha Desika granted by God Srinivāsa. In every way, Śri Krishnamacharya resembled Śrī Vedantha Desika. No wonder to this day the services in the temple at Melkote are conducted in his name, ie.,  Śrī Parakāla ". Even as Śrī Periya Parakāla Swāmi administered the Vaishnava Deeksha and the accompanying sacraments to Śrī Dodda Krishnaraja Wodeyar, Srimad Ghantavatāra administered all the sacraments and Upadesam, etc., and communicated the knowledge of the Sastras to Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. Śri Ghantavatāra then started on a long journey to Thirupathi, Kanchi, Srirangam and other important centres, famous in the history of Śrī Vaishnavism, and, having accorded to the inhabitants of the South the privilege of darshan and worship of Sri Lakshmi Hayagreeva and Sri Lakshmi Nārāyaṇa, the great Swāmi returned to Mysore and Melkote. In the latter place which has been described by Vedantha Desikar as "Yatiparibridha Hridya" (i.e., most favoured of Śri Rāmānuja), he reorganised the worship and the services in the temple in consonance with the spirit and commands of the Alwars and Śri Bhagavan Rāmānuja and Śrī Vedantha Desika including the Koṭhārotsavam. In fact, the spread of Śrī Vaishṇavism in modern Mysore country, after the fall of Seringapatam, may be said to have been entirely due to the combined services of Sri Ghanṭāvatāra and Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, both enjoying the choicest blessings of Śrī Rāmānuja Parakala [[19]] Swāmi, the great Yogi. Brahmatantra Śri Ghantāvara Parakāla Swāmi occupied the Peetham till A.D. 1829, when he retired to Vairagya Sannyasam, having handed over the succession to the Peetham, at the request of the Mahārāja, to Śrī Rāghavacharya of Nallur, a direct descendant of Sri Thirukkurukaippirān Pillān, the successor of Śrī Bhagavad Ramanuja in the Śrī Vaishnava spiritual hierarchy for the propagation of Ubhaya Vedanta, and the recipient of Sri Lakshmi Hayagreeva. 

### Sri Vedantha Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

Born in A.D. 1791, he acquired at a very early age the highest degree of proficiency in the Sastras and Vedantha and, while worshipping at the feet of Śrī Ghantavatāra, he was called upon by the latter to help him in the expounding of the Sastras to the disciples of the Swami; and when it was found that the Swāmi was getting weak owing to old age, he was recommended to His Highness the Mahārāja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar, to become the Rāja Guru, to officiate for Sri Ghantavatāra and discharge the duties attaching to the Mutt. He ascended the Peetham in A.D. 1829. He did indeed justify the selection inasmuch as he attracted by his profound and brilliant scholarship the most learned men from the south to Melkote, where he mostly resided. But he succumbed to the inevitable in A.D. 1836 after a brief illness. The aged Śrī Ghantāvatāra survived him for just a year, and he nominated as the successor to the Peetham occupied by Śrī [[20]] Vedantha Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi-the renowned Srinivasa-Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi III. 

### Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala Swami III 

Born in A.D. 1790 at Tadimarri on the banks of the Pennar and named Śrī Krishnamacharya, this great sage very early in life acquired undisputed mastery over the Sastras even like Śrī Vedantha Desika, before he was twenty. He then sat at the feet of Śrī Ghantavatāra and after studying the Vedantha under him, he acquired the Divyagnyanam and inspiration from Lord Hayagreeva, after the Bharaṇyāsām. 

Like Śrī Vedantha Brahmatantra, his predecessor in the holy seat, he traced his descent direct from Śri Thirukkurukaippiran Pillan, whom he resembled in every way and he was called upon to receive Sannyasam from Śri Vedānta Brahmatantra in 1836 by Śrī Ghantavatāra on account of the illness of the latter, and on his demise was raised to the holy seat of the Sri Brahmatantra Parakāla. 

The Mahārāja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar having by this time left all the affairs of state in the hands of the British Commission, felt free to devote himself to the studies of the Sastras and particularly the Vedantha, at the feet of his Guru. The learned company he found himself in gave the pious King a unique halo of spirituality. The Mahārāja's court now came to shine with the dazzling presence of some of the foremost saints and scholars of the age owing to the influence of his Guru. Mysore may be said [[21]] to have become virtually the Kashmir of the age of Lalitāditya and his successors. The revival and growth of Sanskrit learning under the most peaceful surroundings in Mysore ran parallel to the perfection of the administrative system built up by the wise Commissioners. It was thus that Mysore came to be the model for all the States of the New India built up by Bentinck and Dalhousie, because of the unhindered growth of spiritual forces along with material prosperity. 

It now pleased the Māhāraja to equip his Guru with all the necessary funds and paraphernalia to enable him to undertake a journey to the North for "Dharma Digvijayam" (Aug. 1844 A.D. to 1854 A.D.). It was as though the Mahārāja wanted to show to the people of New India what an enlightened ruler with a perfectly constitutional administrative machinery to help him could do by way of preserving and promoting the ancient Sanathana Dharma of this holy land. Well may his example be followed by the Rulers of the States of India, after the 15th August, 1947 who may elect to stand outside the territories administered by the successors of the British, in the administration of the countries under them. If India came to have in its midst Rajarshis like the last Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV of Mysore and his revered grandfather, what a blessing would it be for this country with its hoary antiquity and its inexhaustible cultural and spiritual stores! 

The record of the journey of Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala Swami has been preserved [[22]] in the shape of a Champu named "Sri Parakālaguru Vijayaḥ", written in his sixteenth year by Śrī Krishnamacharya (later, Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi) the fourth in succession to him in the Holy Seat. Among the sixty odd works which that distinguished Acharya has presented to the world, this Champu was just the maiden production, having been dedicated to the holy feet of his Acharya, in whose entourage throughout the journey he was privileged to be present. The Yatra of Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra may be said. to have been as fruitful in the history of the spread of Śrī Vaishnava culture as that of the great Śrī Rāmānuja a thousand years before him. 

Seeing that the people in the western coastal strips, divided from the Plateau by the soaring heights of the Ghats, had as yet not been much influenced by the Visishtādvaita system of Philosophy, the great Guru directed his path towards the coast and passing through the South Kannada country by way of Kodiyala, reached the seaport of Udupi, sanctified by the birth of Śriman Madhvacharya, the great propounder of the Dwaita Philosophy. The presiding Swāmi of the Mutt there, on being acquainted with the approach of the Acharya, came out to welcome him outside the precincts of the town accompanied with all his regal paraphernalia and by his great assemblage of sishyas and scholars. After the strange but memorable greetings exchanged by the -exponents of the two great Vaishnava systems, the Udupi Swāmi invited the Mahārājaguru of Mysore [[23]] to be his own guest in his Matham. Śrī Srinivāsa having gladly accepted the invitation, the Acharya of Udupi (His Holiness Śrī Vamanathirtha) led on his guest in procession to his Matham, amidst the acclamation of the inhabitants through the streets decorated for the occasion. For the space of three days Śri Srinivasa sojourned in the Madhva Mutt, expounding the Visishtādvaita system to the gatherings there. That sacred place chosen as his residence by Lord Sri Krishna now became the scene of a vast concourse of learned men and devotees from the neighbourhood, who came there to witness the glory of Śri Hayagrīva, along with Śri Lakshmi Narayana and Śrī Venugopala, objects of worship in the golden Mantap of the Parakāla Mutt. The period of three days during which the Swāmi sojourned there was the happiest in the annals of the two mathams, whose heads performed common worship at the feet of Lord Sri Krishna of Udupi. The costliest presents were exchanged between the two great Maṭhādhipathis in the shape of offerings to the deities worshipped in the Mathams. The learned gathering also received similar presents from the two Acharyas. To the regret of both, however, the guest from Mysore took his departure from Udupi. Passing through Shikarpur on the way, Śrī Swāmi arrived at Dharwar, the heart of Karnataka. 

In Dharwar, the great centre of traffic and enlightenment, lived at the time a great many learned men whose ancestors had been favoured with gifts of land and titles during [[24]] the glorious days of the Peshwas of Poona. Karnātakas and Maharashtrians had vied with each other in making that city the centre of enlightenment and opulence, reminiscent of the ancient glory of the Sātavāhanas, Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the later Chalukyas, the Hoysalas, and the Vijayanagara Sovereigns. Amongst the large body of the learned men inhabiting Dharwar at the time, the most renowned was Śrī Ganapathi Sastri who, along with a profound knowledge of all other Darsanas, had earned special reputation as the leading exponent of the Vaiseshika system of Śrī Kanāda. Accompanied by a large concourse of Sishyas and leading scholars of various other schools, Ganapathi Sastri made his visit to the Swami and engaged him in a friendly sastraic discussion. A great disputation ensued between him and the Acharya in the Sastras, according to ancient custom. Profoundly enlightened by the Swami's expounding of the Visishtādvaita, Ganapathi Sastri performed obeisance to him along with his own vast congregation of disciples. While the Swami dwelt in Dharwar, immensely to the joy of the inhabitants, there came a Śrī Vaishnava gentleman of repute from Belgaum, named Śrī Thimmappaiengar, alike famous for his learning and wealth. Having worshipped at the feet of the Swami, the gentleman invited Śri Swamigal to Belgaum to spend the Châturmasyam days there as his guest. The Acharya accepted the invitation and repaired to Belgaum, followed by a large host of learned men, [[25]] representatives of all systems of philosophy, from Mysore, Udupi and Dharwar. The long sojourn in Belgaum of the Swamijee afforded the opportunity for the scholars about the country to visit the Swamijee and pay their homage. Daily Vidwat Sabhas had become the characteristic feature of the period of the stay of the Swami in Belgaum. Thimmappiengar, also known as Sreenivasacharya, had the privilege of receiving the Nyasavidya from His Holiness. 

In the meantime, the news of the Acharya's proposed visit to the north had preceded him and the Sri Sankaracharya of the holy peetham of Sankeshwar, who had been described as "the sun for the lotus of Sankara Siddhantha ", sent the vidwans of his āsthānam with the invitation to the Swāmi to visit Sankeshwar and accept his hospitality in his Matham. Śrī Swāmi readily agreed and, led by the envoys from Sankeshwar, entered the holy city amidst the acclamations of the people and was warmly welcomed by Śrī Sankaracharya to his Maṭham. The two Swāmis representing the two systems of philosophy, living together, engaged in daily disquisitions, presented a unique spectacle to the gathering there. Appraised of the tidings of the Mysore Mahārājaguru's triumphant Dharma Digvijayam, the Mahārāja of Kolhapur now requested the Swami to extend to him and to his State the privilege of His Holiness's visit. The invitation was of course accepted, and the Swāmi received there the usual Royal welcome and the homage of many of the chiefs of the Southern Mahratta States, assembled there for the purpose of[[26]] obtaining the darśan of the renowned sage. There the Swāmi had the joy and privilege of worshipping Śrī Mahalakshmi, the presiding deity of Maharashtra. The Ruler of Sangli was then accorded the privilege of worshipping Śrī Hayagriva in his Palace. There, at Sangli, had arrived from Satara a scholar of high repute, Śrī Nārāyaṇa by name, versed in the Kanāda lore. The usual disputation regarding the respective Sastras took place, to the interest and joy of the great gathering. Having received the blessings of the Acharya, the rulers assembled made the costliest presents to Lord Hayagrīva amongst which was a fine elephant mounted with a silver mantap (howdah). Before the Swami took leave of the Ruler of Sangli, Śrī Nārāyaṇa had carried the fame of the Acharya to the Raja of Satāra, his patron. That Chief now invited him to his famous capital. While the Swāmi was at Satāra, there arrived the greatest Vyakaraṇa scholar named Śrī Bhāskara accompanied by an army of equally famous scholars, poets and philosophers, versed in the various sastras. Śrī Bhāskara was the Rājāguru of Satāra. 

The distinguished meetings held there were productive of the greatest advantage to everyone present during those memorable days. Amongst the presents made to Śri Hayagriva by the Ruler of Satara were two famous white horses. Meanwhile there had arrived too, at Satāra, the famous capital of Sri Chatrapati Shahoo, Sri Krishna Bhatta from Poona, the capital of the Shrimants, the Peshwas. He had been sent by Sri Mohana [[27 ]] Săstri, the most learned and the most renowned exponent of all the sastras, recognised, however, by all India as the particular advocate of the Advaita philosophy. After the usual disputations Śrī Swamijee was invited by Śrī Krishna Bhatta to Poona, to meet the vast concourse of Pandits, hailing from the remotest regions of India, under the headship of the great Sri Mohana Sastri. Under the accomplished Peshwa Bajeerao II, been turned into a Saraswathi Peetham' as it were. And Śri Mohana Sastri might be said to have been the recognised guardian of the Peetham. Driven from their homes by the disastrous revolutions which had overwhelmed the kingdoms and the Empires of India to the north of the Krishna, due to the wars raging over two centuries, the most reputed scholars had resorted to Poona, which had been made the sanctuary for what remained of Hindu culture by the great Shahoo and the Peshwas. It was verily the last culture centre of the South, a reminiscence of Takshasila, Nalanda, Nuddia and Kashi of the north. 

The whole city turned up to have darṣan of the great Acharya of the south-the reputed Maharajaguru of Mysore. Amidst the tumultuous welcome in which joined all classes of men and women, Śri Swāmijee made a triumphal entry into Poona. In the midst of the vast gathering was Śri Mohan Sastri, who was amongst the first to welcome the Swāmi as he entered the city. When the Sastri heard the words "UBHAYA VEDANTHACHARYA [[28]] amongst the titles, sounded by the followers of the Swāmi, the Sastri turned to the Swami and with a smile asked which the two Vedanthas referred to were. He himself knew of three! He received the necessary explanations that the two Vedanthas were the two alternative paths of salvation, indicated in the Vedic Upanishads as well as in the Dravidopanishats in Tamil, the latter having been recognised universally as the South Indian counterparts of the Vedas from the age of Agasthya (as complete and sacred as Vedic literature, known as the northern Aryan path was)-having been revealed to the Alwars. Thus, the two great teachers in happy conversation passed through the decorated streets of Poona, receiving the homage of every one till the Swami reached 

Śrī "Thulasīvanam" home, Raghavarya's son Śrī Nrisimhārya been prepared for the residence of the Swami. Poona was en fete for the day. Mohan Sastri and others betook themselves to their homes, taking leave of the Swami for the day. The next morning, after the usual services and worship in the Mutt at (Thulasīvanam) as the Acharya was engaged in expounding the Sastras to Śrī Narasimhacharya, Śrī Lakshminrisimhacharya, Śrī Ananthacharya and other disciples, there appeared before the assemblage of disciples, a veritable army of the foremost Indian scholars of the age, led by Śrī Mohan Sastri, among the former being Śrī Bhikkhusāstri, Triyambakasāstri, Gopālācharya, Krishna Bhatta mentioned above, Ganesha Sūri, Ramachandra 

the 

of which had 

29 

Shastri, Dābācharya, Narāyaṇasāstri, Mahadevasǎstri, Vishnusāstri, Govindasāstri, Dhondoo Pandit, Balasastri and several others of repute, expert representatives of the various Darśanas. The visitors were received with a warm sign of welcome by the Acharya seated in his Asanam. Having made their obeisance, the assemblage of visitors was asked to be seated. After a spell of deep silence to which the assemblage lapsed for a while, Sri Mohana Sastri was the first to speak. With a respectful but challenging attitude the great scholar started a disputation with the question as to how it was that the Acharya elected to assume the "Tridanda" Sannyasam forbidden as it was in the Kali age by most of the Dharmasastras like "NIRNAYA SINDHU". After a long discussion over this and other allied subjects, like the wearing of Sikha, Yagnopavitha, Kațisūtra, etc., having received convincing sastraic explanations, the great Sastri, free from passion and prejudice, now rose from his place and begging forgiveness for his non-performance of the Sashṭāngapraṇāmam at the feet of the Swāmi up to the moment, along with his disciples. performed the Dandavathpraṇāmam a dozen times, -a token of repentance and prayer for forgiveness. In the afternoon, too, they repeated their visit; and disputation on other topics continued till evening when the assembly broke up for the day. Săstri and The following morning, Śri Mohan 

others started a discussion on the propriety of the "Taptachakrānkaṇam ", " Oordhvapundradhāraṇam' and such allied subjects relating to the outward 

30 

practices of the Śrī Vaishnava cult, with the same result as on the previous day. The audience returned to their abodes fully convinced by the Acharya's arguments in favour of these. In this manner, each day was devoted to a controversy relating to the various systems, expounded by everyone of the party headed by the celebrated Sastri. In the end, at the conclusion of the Sabha, lasting over a month Śrī Mohan Sastri stood up and acknowledged that he was discomfitted-sastraically, of course, on all counts and declared that the Swami, by having the best of all the disputations, might claim to have won over all the Sastris of India, those of Kashi, Mithila, Gauda, Anga, Vanga, Gujara and so forth. 

As a sign of the recognition by them of the spiritual supremacy established over them, Śrī Krishna Bhatta, Śrī Mohan Sastri and many other Sastris performed Pādapūja to the Swami, begged for and got the holy Sreepadathirtham of the Great Acharya and expressed their gratefulness. "Blessed, indeed, is the great sovereign who has the fortune of having such an Acharya for his Guru" said they. Day after day, the Swami was then taken to their homes by the Pandits for worship of Sri Hayagrīva and Pādapūja and Shreepadathirtham for their families also. 

On one of these days, Śrī Mohan Sastri, as the leader of the Pandits, stood up in the assembly and read aloud a document in which he stated that he and his followers were indeed overcome thoroughly in the sastraic battles by the great Acharya. Copies 

31 

of this signed by them, were also despatched to the great Sabhas of the learned men in the north. Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala now thought of proceeding on a tour to the sacred places of the north in the company of his followers to secure for them the advantage of a Thirthayatra. Taking leave of Śrī Nrisimhacharya, Mohan Săstri and all others, Śrī Swami left Poona to the north. By quick marches, Śri Swami crossed the Krishna and reached Nāsik on the Godavari. Attracted by the association of the place with the memory of Sri Ramachandra, the Swami proposed to spend the Chāturmāsam days there. 

This provided an opportunity for the distinguished scholars of the north to repair to the Swami's abode and the whole period was spent there with daily sabhas and lectures and Upadeśams. Once, however, a holy Muslim Peer visiting the Swāmi,-by permission, engaged in prolonged discussion with him, and was ultimately satisfied that the teachings of Islam were in no way contradictory to the spirit of Sanathana Dharma; and he joyfully performed profound obeisance to the Swami. By this time, Mahārāja Sree Krishṇarāja Wodeyar, having arranged to celebrate SHASTIPURTHI SANTI (A.D. 1854-60 years from his birth A.D. 1794) according to the Sastra, had despatched a letter begging the Swāmi for his return immediately to Mysore to grant him the privilege of his presence on the occasion. Unless he had performed the Pādapūja to the Guru and received his blessings, it would not be 

22 

32 

appropriate for him to go through the necessary ceremonials, he felt. Moved by the importunity of his foremost Royal disciple, the Swami made up his mind to return to Mysore and on the day following the completion of Chaturmasya, exactly a fortnight before the Dasara, he left Nasik, to the profound sorrow of all who had the privilege of enjoying his Darśan and listening to his learned lectures and Upadeśams for over ten months. 

In the meantime, the Raja of Akkalkot, having heard of the return journey of the Swami towards Mysore, sent messengers to him with the invitation to grace his capital with his presence in the course of his journeys. The Swami having accorded his assent, the Rāja came out of his capital and led on the Acharya in procession to his Palace. There, at Akkalkot, the Raja with his following and his citizens had the privilege of Darśan and performance of Pūjas of the Swami for the space of a week. Among the presents that the Raja offered to Sri Hayagreeva was a famous elephant. 

1 

By forced marches the Acharya arrived at Melkote. Straight away he proceeded to the temple of Śrī Nārāyaṇa after receiving the temple. honours at the outskirts. After worshipping there he entered his own Mutt on the Kalyāni Thirtham. The next morning, after finishing the worship at the Mutt, the Swāmi proceeded up the Hill of Sri Yoga Nrisimha and after the puja returned to the Mutt. By that time messengers had arrived from Mahārāja Śri Krishnaraja Wodeyar bearing the letter conveying 

33 

the Royal disciple's feelings of happiness at the return of his Guru to his own country after the triumphal journey to the north and begging his immediate return to the capital. The Guru started forthwith. On the way, he halted at Srirangapatnam for a day. In the afternoon a special messenger named Śrī Mukhāmi Narasimhacharya, despatched by the Mahārāja, brought the tidings in advance that Śrīmān Mahārāja would go over the next day in person to receive his Guru in Srirangapatnam and escort him to the capital himself the next morning. The Swami having paid his visit to Śrī Ranganatha Temple for worship, returned to the Mutt, and had scarcely finished performing the worship at noon, when the Maharaja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar arrived in State to pay homage to his Guru, after a long separation. His joy when he beheld him can better be imagined than described. After getting the Darsan of Śrī Hayagrīva, the Royal Disciple fell at the feet of the great Acharya and bathed them with tears of joy. 

After a brief but moving and happy conversation, the Maharaja led his Acharya to a new golden palanquin which he had brought in his train. The procession to the capital, led by the Royal Disciple in person, who alternately drove in his State Carriage, walked on foot some yards, again riding on horseback, reached the capital which had been prepared for the reception. Amidst the acclamations of the people, the Guru and the Royal Sishya slowly passed through the streets. It was indeed like the entrance to Ayodhya of Sri Ramachandra, after his return [[34]] from exile, led by Bharata. After the reception in the Palace and the usual visits to the temples, the Swāmi returned to the Mutt, in Śrī Sveta Varahaswami Temple. From then, onwards, Śrī Mahārāja Krishnaraja Wodeyar, sitting at the feet of his Guru, started a systematic study of Sri Bhagavad Gita, the Bhashyas and Śrī Bhagavadvishayam. Alternately residing on the banks of the Kapila, the Cauvery, and in Mysore, Śrī Swāmi lived up till A.D. 1861, a dazzling ornament to the grand assemblage at the Royal court of Mysore of the foremost Pandits and seers of the age. He conferred the Sannyasa Asram on Śrī Srinivasa Desikendra at the request of the Mahārāja, before he left the world. 

### Sri Srinivasa Desikendra Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

Born in 1802 A.D., receiving his Chakrānkaṇam and Sreemad Bhashyam from Śri Brahmatantra Ghantavatara Parakala, Bharaṇyasam from Śrī Vedantha and Thatvārtha and Mokshāsramam from Śri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Swatantra, Śrī Srinivasa Desikendra, a native of Palya in the Goribidanur taluk, had early acquired the height of proficiency in "Veda, Vedāngas, Purvottara Mimāmsas and Sri Bhagavadvishaya and all the Sastras ", so that he came to be described as a second sun in Brahmavarchas ". Having ascended the Peetham (1861) and having taught the Ubhaya Vedantha to a host of scholars, the Swami started on "Dharmadigvijayam tour". Proceeding to the east and south [[35]] the Swāmi visited the holy shrines at Thirumalai, Śri Kanchi and Srirangam, etc. 

Everywhere he distinguished himself in the friendly disputations with the leading scholars of the age versed in the Vishistādvaita system. Śrī Lakshmi Amba, consort of the Rāja of Atmakur, in Hyderabad Kingdom, received Chakrānkaņa, Bharaṇyāsam and Manthropadesam from him. He also bestowed the gift of Prapatti on Mahārāja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar at the closing days of his glorious and highly spiritualised life. Fortunate indeed was that great Ruler, who enjoyed the spiritual blessings of five great Acharyas, Śrī Rāmānuja, Śrī Ghantavatāra, Śrī Vedantha, Śrī Srinivasa and Sri Srinivasa Desikendra Parakālas in his long rule-even like Śrī Rāmānujachārya and Śrī Periya Parakala. The history of Sri Srinivasa Desikendra's journey to the south and north has been preserved in the Champu "Sreemad Uttara Parakāla Guru Vijaya" by Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi. 

### Sri Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

On the demise of Sri Srinivasa Desikendra in A.D. 1873, the succession to the Brahmatantra Parakala Peetham passed on to Sri Ranganatha. Born at Vayalpad on the banks of the Bāhuda (Cuddapah District) in the famous family of Śrī Vādhūla, in A.D. 1812, Śrī Ranganatha, the son of Śrī Nrisimhacharya, even at a very early age, developed such grasp of Vedas and Vedāngas by intuition that he came to be described as "Brihaspati [[36]] Samo buddhya" and merited the title of "Sarvatantra Swatantra" like Śrī Vedantha Desika. He addressed himself to the task undertaken by Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra from where he had left at Nasik, and while yet a young grihastha, travelled wide over Northern India engaged in propagating Śrī Vaishnava Siddhanta and seizing every occasion to be present at the great Sabhas at Jaipur, Kāshi, Darbhanga, etc., where the most distinguished scholars of the days assembled and discussed. Having established his reputation as the unchallenged reestablisher of the Visishtādvaita philosophy in the north, particularly in the Sabha assembled at sacred Kashi for the purpose, Śrī Ranganatha settled down in Rewa State at the earnest invitation of Śrī Mahārāja Raghuraj Singh Bahadur, to whom he became the specially favourite Acharya. He was familiarly known as Rewa Rangacharya Swāmi in the North. Śrī Govardhan Rangacharya who had carried the banner of Sri Bhagavan Rāmānuja and the Alwārs into North-Western India to Madhura and Brindavan, showed the highest honours to him. 

Succeeding to the holy seat of Śri Brahmatantra Parakāla Mutt, he became the central figure amongst the most distinguished scholars of the age, representatives of all the Sastras and Darśanas; and every evening a great Sabha in Mysore gathered round him and received his help in the maintenance and unhindered growth of the knowledge of ancient Sastras. The great "Saraswati Prasada Pathasāla " (now "The Mahārāja's Sanskrit College") at Mysore [[37]] derived its strength and usefulness as the result of the Sabhas held in the Mutt. The great Swāmi became a Vikramaditya, as it were, as the head of the Sabha of the Mutt, pandits, vying with each other, in their endeavours to win the Swami's approval for any particular Siddhanta which they might seek to expound. Sreeman Mahārāja Śrī Chamarajendra Wodeyar received Chakrānkaṇam and other accompaniments of Vaishnava deeksha from this Swāmi (1884). The Gadi of Śrī Brahmatantra Parakala was adorned by him for the space of twelve years till A.D. 1885. 

In A.D. 1877, the most terrible famine swept over South India, affecting Mysore seriously; and at least the inhabitants of the capital and the suburban villages round Mysore were saved from starvation by the gift of the Mutt under the orders of the Swami. This, however, involved the Mutt in a great financial crisis. It was, however, tided over with great difficulty by his successor on the Śri Hayagriva Peetham in A.D. 1885, Śri Krishna Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi, the greatest Poet Acharyaswāmi after Śrī Vedantha Desikar. 

### Sri Krishna Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

The study of "Śrī Parakāla Guru Vijayam composed in his sixteenth year and dedicated to the lotus feet of Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami and which won for him even so early the title of "Kavisarvabhauma itself is sufficient to enable one to regard him as the chosen of Śrī 

38 

Lord Hayagriva. Born in A.D. 1839 in Amidela on the banks of the Pinākini as the second son of Śrī Thāthācharya, a scion of the renowned Ghanagiri (Penukonda) Appalacharya, the author of "Saraprakāsika ", a resident of Hosadurga, he was named Krishna after Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakāla (whose name it was as a Grihastha) who had foretold of his birth as he once blessed the Swami's father. Before he was sixteen he had acquired such proficiency in Vyakaraṇa, Sahitya, Alankara and allied Sāstras that he was able to produce the "Parakāla Guru Vijaya," which won for him the title of "KaviSārvabhauma". After receiving Panchasamskāram from Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra, he was blessed with the gift of Śrī Hayagriva Mantram from the great Swami on the banks of the Kapila when he was just sixteen. Having been blessed with the teaching of Śrī Bhāshya and other Vedantha Granthas by that illustrious Acharya, he was enjoined to assume the Grihastha Asram and proceed to the Samasthānam of Anegundi at the invitation of the Ruler Śrī Thirumalaraya, offered through Śrī Srinivasa Brahmatantra Swami. There, at the former's request, he composed "Srirangarāja Vilāsam" as a tribute to the Ruler's family God Śrī Ranganatha. From there he proceeded to Gadwal Samasthānam at the invitation of Śrī Rāmabhoopāla, the Raja, and at his request wrote the Champu "Karthikothsava Deepika " as a tribute to Sri Kesava Swami, the Raja's family God. The Raja of Atmakur, Mukkara Śrī Seetharama Bhoopala, invited Śrī Krishnamacharya [[39]] Kavisarvabhauma to his Samasthānam and begged him to compose a work to be dedicated to Śrī Srinivasa, his family God. The result was the Champu of "Sri Srinivasa Vilāsam". This visit to Atmakur was followed by the visit to Vanaparthi Samasthānam, whose Rāja Śrī Rameshwara Rao had several works composed by the poet among which was Chapeṭāhati Stuti". At the Rāni Śrī Sankaramba's special request, the poet composed in nine hours on the same day at a stretch "Uttara Ranga Mahatmyam " and "Śrī Rameshwara Vijayam". Continuing his journey to Jataprole Kolhapur, he was received in State by the Rāja Srī Venkatanatha Rao; and implored by him, he produced in one night "Śri Nrisimha Vilāsam" and in another night "Madana Gopāla Māhātmyam". Finally, at the request of the Raja of Vanaparthi, he settled down at the place and was engaged in the teachings of Darśanams to the large armies of scholars who resorted thither. 

Visiting Mysore, once, Sri Krishnamacharya received Bharanyasa at the feet of Srinivāsa Desikendra Brahmatantra Parakala Swami, who was then at Srirangapatnam. During his stay there, he composed the "Uttara Parakāla Digvijayam," a Champoo constituting the history of Śrī Desikendra's Dharma Digvijayam" in the South at Thirupathi, Śrī Kanchi, Thiruvallur, Srirangam and other sacred places; as also the "Vedapādastava" and dedicated both the works to Śrī Swāmi. He was then blessed by the Swami who was pleased [[40]] to foretell that Śrī Krishnamacharya would one day certainly grace the Holy Peetham of Śrī Brahmatantra Parakala Mutt. 

Returning to Vanaparthi, the Acharya expounded to the Rāņi, Sreemad Rāmāyaṇa, Sreemad Māhābhāratha, Śrī Vishnu Purāņam and Sreemad Bhagavatham. While he was engaged in giving lectures on the last he came to the possession of a commentary on it, written by Śri Veeraraghava Swāmi named "Munibhavaprakāsika", and after much industry and careful research got a copy made of it and had it published at the request of the Rāņi. By this time, Śrī Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi had been feeling old and sent for Śrī Krishnamacharya at Vanaparthi. On his arrival at Srirangapatnam, the Acharya offered his homage to the Swāmi along with the Granthas he had composed as humble dedications to Śrī Swāmi. He dwelt there a considerable time, engaged in the study of Darsanas, and when he proposed to take leave of him, Śri Ranganatha Brahmatantra was pleased to say that he would prove to be his own worthy successor to the Holy Peetham after him and having prepared the Acharya for the same by the gift of the necessary mantrams and other Upadeśams, he permitted him to return to Vanaparthi, at the same time enjoining on him to be prepared to go over to Mysore when the call would go forth to him from the Mahārāja. Accordingly, blessed by three predecessors of his, Śri Krishnamacharya ascended the Peetham on the demise of Śri Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla [[41]] in A.D. 1886. (Salivahana 1807 Parthiva, Śrāvaṇa Bahula Dasami.) 

### Sri Sri Krishna Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

It has been pointed out that owing to the help rendered to the famine-stricken citizens of Mysore during 1877, the Mutt had to incur an inordinately heavy debt. The first act of His Holiness Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra on ascending the Gādi was 

the arrangement made by carefully planned economy to redeem the debt by a process of instalments. With the ungrudging co-operation of His Highness the Mahārāja Śrī Chamarajendra Wodeyar and Sir K. Seshadri Iyer, the Dewan, the Swami was able to put the finances of the institution on a stable footing. The occasion of the final redemption of the debt by His Highness the Mahārāja Śrī Krishnarajendra Wodeyar IV (25-6-1903) was marked by the visit of the Mahārāja to the Swami and the holding of the first of the series of the Vajra Dolotsavam inaugurated in His Highness's presence. The feast has since become an annual function like the Vairamudi Utsavam at Melkote, inaugurated by Śrī Rāmānuja. The Utsavam is held on the occasion of the reigning King's Birthday. The completion of the printing of the Śrī Bhāgavatha commentary by Śrī Veeraraghava was the next task accomplished by Sri Swāmi with the help of the Rāņi of Vanaparthi Samasthānam in 1893. 

Śrī Seetha Vilāsa Devājammanni Mahārāṇiyavaru, consort of Śrī Krishṇarāja Wodeyar III, receive [[42]] Bharanyasam at the feet of Sri Krishna Brahmatantra Parakala Swāmi. In 1899 (Vikāri, Jyeshta) on the occasion of Śrī Swami's completing his 60th year, the Queen Mother Mahā Mātbrisri Śrī Mahārāṇi Vāṇivilāsa Sannidhana and Śrī Krishnarajendra Wodeyar IV invited Śrī Swāmi to the Palace and had the Śri Hayagrīva Aradhanam specially performed there. Śrī Mahārāņi Vāņivilāsa Sannidhāna, Śrī Mahārāja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and the former's brother Sri Sirdar Kantaraj Urs (later, Dewan) received the Chakrānkaņam and accompanying Mantropadeśam at the sacred hands of Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra Parakāla. 

At the request of Sri Swami, His Highness the Mahārāja Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar and Her Highness Śrī Mahārāņi Vāņivilāsa, the Queen Mother, had the Old Mutt in the capital rebuilt to house the Lord Śrī Hayagrīva and Śrī Lakshmi Narāyaṇa. 

In response to the prayers of its inhabitants, His Holiness undertook a journey to Kulaganam near Nanjangud and blessed hundreds of Halekarnataka Brahmanas with Chakrānkaṇam, etc. 

Among the sixty-seven odd works written by the Swamijee during the fifty-seven years, beginning from the sixteenth, are Champoos like 

"Śrī Parakala Guru Vijaya," Nātakas like "Subhadrā Parinaya," Sthothrams like "Prapanna Sowbhagya Stuti," Dharma Sastras like "Saraswathi Muladhanam", Commentaries like "Lakshmi Sahasra Prakāsika and Hamsasandesa Rasāswādini and the great work on Rhetoric, "Alankara [[43]]Manihara" dedicated to Sri Venkatesha, Lord of Thirupathi. Thus, having graced the Asthānam of Lord Sri Hayagriva for a long and glorious period of twenty-seven years, the Great Acharya proved to be a second Vedantha Desika appearing on the earth in the modern world. 

In order that the Asthānādhipatyam of the Mutt might continue unimpaired during the rapidly deteriorating period the world is passing through with its modernness, Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra, just before his end had installed on the Peetham, with the approval of Śrī Krishṇarāja Wodeyar IV, Śrī Purāṇam Narasimha Acharya Swami of Gadwal, the head of the assemblage of Pandits of that Samasthānam, which was a miniature Kashmir of modern times attracting the most profound scholars and artists of repute. While doing so, the Great Swami-with the strange foresight characteristic of him, also advised His Highness that his successor now named "Śrī Vāgisha Brahmatantra Parakala Swami" should in his turn be succeeded by Śrī Rangacharya of Atmakur, Srimad-Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami, the present occupant of the Peetham. 

### Sri Vagisha Brahmatantra Parakala Swami 

Sri Vāgheesha Brahmatantra Parakāla, a descendant of a renowned family of holy pandits, had, as the hereditary head of the Vidwat Sabha of Gadwal Samasthānam, early attracted the attention of Sri Krishna Brahmatantra during the days when the latter was at Vanaparthi. Added to his proficiency in Vyakaraṇa, which had earned for him [[44]] fame as a second Panini, this Acharya was equally well versed in all the Darsanas and by his versatility and varied talents was able to exercise a decisive voice in the concourse of Pandits anywhere. In addition to this, he possessed Yogic powers known only to a few of his acquaintances like Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra. 

During the short period of twelve years (Virodhikrit to Krodhana) Śrī Krishṇarāja Wodeyar made three public visits to the Mutt in all formality. The first was on the occasion of the Annual Vidwat Sabha of Chaturmāsya and the last on the occasion of the installation of the image of Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra in the Brindavan. On the last occasion, His Highness the Mahārāja was accompanied by His Highness the Yuvaraja Śrī Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wodeyar. But the numerous private visits of His Highness were more fruitful inasmuch as they were long and had for their chief purpose the brief but close and authoritative study by His Highness of the fundamental tenets of the Visishtādwaita system of philosophy direct from his Acharya. At the earnest request of Her Highness, Śrī Mahāraṇi Vāņivilāsa, His Holiness more than once visited the Palace and gave Upadeśams to all the members of the Royal Family in regard to Bharaṇyasam, Thirumanthrārtham, etc. 

Supreme simplicity, characteristic of this great Swāmi, like Mahatma Gandhi, attracted one and all to him. It may be mentioned that some Advaitic scholars even received Bharanyasam from the Swāmi. As an example of the Swami's sympathetic nature [[45 ]] may be mentioned the fact that when His Holiness Śrī Chandrasekhara Bharathi Swami of Sringeri was reported to be seriously suffering from some mental derangement, Śrī Vāgeesa successfully prayed to Śrī Hayagriva for the former's quick recovery and when he visited Mysore in the course of his "Dharma Digvijayam" Śrī Vageesa Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami sent a message of congratulations to the head of the Sringeri Jagadguru Peetham through his accredited agent. The memory of this Great Acharya is gratefully cherished by his numerous disciples and non-Sishyas, too, who had the privilege of studying the Sastras directly sitting at his blessed feet. 

A remarkable attestation of the Swami's Yogic power was the fact that quite recently, when the grave of the Swami was opened for the removal of the earth after nearly twenty years with a view to filling it up afresh for the construction of the monument (Brindavan) over it, the Swami's body, Yogic pose, and all the articles buried with it were found intact, just as they were, at the time of the internment. Lest his Samadhi should be disturbed, no time was lost in covering up the receptacle and erecting the Mantapam over it. Such a Yogin was the great occupant of the Sri Brahmatantra Parakāla Mutt Peetham from 1912 to 1925. The funeral of this Swami was attended by all Government Officers and the Members of the Representative Assembly, which was in session at the time, and which was suspended as soon as the demise of the Swami was announced. 

46 

In accordance with the wish expressed during his life-time by His Holiness Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra to His Highness Śrī Krishnaraja Wodeyar and Śrī Mahārāņi Vāņivilāsa, the latter, much against the Acharya's own wishes, raised Śrī Rangacharya Swāmi to the position of the Raja Guru of Mysore on 15th October 1925 as "Śri Lakshmi Hayagriva Divya Paduka Sevaka 

[[55]] 

### Sreemad Abhinava Sri Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakala Swami, 

Born in Tharaṇa-Parthiva (1884) as the result of prayers to Śrī 

Śri Lakshmi Nrisimha and Sri Ramachandra, Śrī Rangacharya, a scion of the family of Haritha to which Śrī Rāmānuja belonged, early moved out to Mysore from his place of birth at the age of seventeen prompted by his unquenchable thirst for the divine knowledge to crown his knowledge of the Sastras which he had already attained at a very early age. Śrī Krishna Brahmatantra discerned this legitimate greed for gnyānam, and bestowed on him Śrī Chakrānkaṇam and Śrī Bhashyartham and consigned him to the care of Śrī Panditaratnam Kastūri Rangacharya Swāmi, who had already won for himself as great a name in India as his renowned teacher Sri Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla. Along with the study of the Darśanams, Nyāya, Sahitya, Mīmāmsa, Vaiseshika and Visishtādwaita Vedantha, Sri Rangacharya conducted his regular studies of Sahitya, Alankara, Vyakaraṇa, etc., under the respective teachers in

" 

the Mahārāja's Sanskrit College. But even more than his profound and complete scholarship, it was the Swami's resolute performance of every one of his duties as a Grihastha as an "Ahitāgni", as a Shatkarma Niratha", as a Shaḍangadikshita as a Shaddarshani Paradrashta", which marked him out for the exalted position he is now occupying. Throughout his Grihastha Asrama, the sacred fire ever burnt under his roof even as in the Parnakutīram of the rishis of ancient times. On one occasion in Pushya-Makara, during a solar eclipse, in the early hours of the morning, when there was an unparalleled and terrible downpour accompanied by biting chill, amidst the thousands who had gathered on the banks of the Cauvery, in Gautama Kshetram, there was this solitary Grihastha, present with his Grihini and the sacred fire in the pot, protecting it with all his resources as a fond mother does her baby threatened by a ruffian for its jewels. Such has ever been the unwavering, unflinching, appalling earnestness and devotion and attachment of this Acharya to the practice of Arya Dharma. Even in these degenerate days, that there should be such living monuments of the ancient culture augurs well for the future on which we can safely rely. But unostentatious service (Kainkaryam) and "Thyaga" have ever been his watchwords all these fifty years. 

Having been called upon to fill the position of Trustee and guardian of Śrī Hayagrīva Samasthānam, he has naturally been devoting all his energies, all his [[48]] physical and mental resources to Seva with unflinching resolve like Śrī Varadrāmānuja Swāmi of Srirangam and Śrī Kanchi, from whom Śrī Rangacharya, the Grihastha, he received the Bharaṇyasam",-Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha has won renown all over South India, as "Vairagya Acharya Vardhi ", in addition to his being regarded Gnynānāmburashi like Śri Periya 

LL 

as a 

Parakāla Swāmi whose seat he has been occupying. Like him, too, he is engaged in the "Jeernoddhāraṇam" of the Divya Desams associated with the name of Śrī Nigamanthacharya, and also acquiring centres from where the teachings of Śrī Rāmānuja may be carried forward, in Thirupathi, in distant Rewah, Allahabad, Śrī Kanchi, Satyagālam, Śri Alwar Thirunagari, Śrī Thiruvaheendrapuram, etc. To facilitate the propaganda of Śrī Vedantha Desikar, he himself has started a "Vedantha Vihāra Sabha" under the auspices of which annual examinations are conducted-on the model of modern universities, and ancient sadas, prizes awarded and extension lectures delivered in the Mutt. For all this, to supplement the ordinary resources of the Mutt, voluntary endowments are being made and contributions sent from distant places by men and women donors, some of them preferring to remain anonymous. Although himself reluctant to stay in cities, the renowned Swamijee has been obliged to stay in this capital to which resort men and women of all conditions, all Jignyāsus and Bhaktas, both the learned and the  [[49]]ignorant. The frequent Sabhas composed of all Pandits and schools of learning and philosophy are naturally easier in a capital city like Mysore, combining the orthodox with the more modern. Reprinting revised publications, and printing new works such as Śri Hayagriva Pancharatram," further commentaries on "Nyaya Siddhānjanam, Siddhitrayam, Śrī Bhagavad Vishayam with the Vyakhyānam", hitherto unpublished, all the granthas of Śrī Rāmānuja and Sri Nigamantha Desikaall these are being accomplished by the great Swāmi whose industry and zeal know no bounds. Under the presidency of this Great Swami, the Mutt has become a rallying centre for all that is great and cherishable in the ancient lore of this land. 

Removal of some of the disabilities of the unfortunate" Tirukkulattars ", "Harijans ", "Scheduled Classes ", etc., has also received the attention. of this Great Sage as was exemplified when that stolid champion of Hinduism, the late Śrī Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, approached the Swāmi on one occasion during his visit to Mysore for the purpose. Then, a most representative Vidwat Sabha was held in the Mutt, also attended by personages like Sir Mirza Ismail. After a thorough discussion, for two days in succession, it was agreed that Mantra Deeksha was allowed by the Sastras for the Harijans with some reservations and Mālavīyaji went away satisfied with the verdict of the Swamijee. On another occasion (December 1927), when an earnest seeker of truth from Marburg, a European gentleman, 

50 

Rudolf Otto," generally acknowledged as one of the very first theologians of Germany ", sought interview with the Swāmi, the latter readily accorded him the interview and the worker went away supremely enlightened and acknowledged his obligation to the Swami in a book "India's Religion of Grace and Christianity Compared and Contrasted" (1930) which he subsequently published. He was accompanied by Birger Forrel, Rector of the ParishTillinge, Sweden, Enköping. 

His Highness Śrī Mahārāja Mārtanda Singhjee of Rewah visted the Mutt, and paid his obeisance to the Swāmi and received His blessings before he ascended the Gadi of his ancestors. It is no exaggeration to say that His Holiness Śrīmad Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami occupies as high a position in the spiritual world of South India as his great predecessor Śrī Periya Parakalar occupied in the 17th and 18th centuries. It should, however, be mentioned that such stupendous work has been rendered possible by the fact that the Swami, early in his career as the RAJA GURU, wisely selected a band of devoted men of proved ability to advise him in the ordinary administrative duties of the Mutt. And it is the consciousness of his being the "Śrī Lakshmi Hayagrīva Divya Paduka Sevaka" which has always helped him throughout the score of years he has been gracing the Divya Simhasanam. Well might his example be emulated by every other occupant of similar position in this dear old land of ours!! May Lord Sri Hayagrīva grant another 

51 

two score years of the same uninterrupted service to Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra 

Parakāla Swāmi, even as He was pleased to vouchsafe to Śrī Rāmānuja Parakala Swami the founder of the modern State of Mysore !

No. 34.-CONJEEVERAM INSCRIPTION OF 

BRAHMA-TANTRA-SVATANTRA-JIYAR 

SAKA 1282 

BY SRI A. S. RAMANATHA AYYAR, B.A., MADRAS Extract: 

"The inscription1 published below is engraved on the north wall of the second prākāra of the Varadarāja temple at Little-Conjeeveram, otherwise called Vishņu-Kāñchi, which is very sacred to the Vaishnavas of the south. 

The characters in which the record is engraved are Tamil and Grantha, the latter being employed for the Sanskrit words. The language is Tamil with an admixture of Sanskrit words, and is somewhat illustrative of the type of Vaishnava composition prevalent in this period and locality. The record is very well preserved, and its orthography does not call for any comment. 

The record does not quote any king's name but is simply dated in Saka 1282 and contains the astronomical details-Vikārin, Mēsha śu. 1, Friday and Aśvati-which yield the equivalent A.D. 1359, March 29. It states that a certain Vaishnavadāsa who had been given the title of Brahma-tantra-svatantraJiyar by the god (Hastigirīśa), was put in charge of a matha evidently at Kanchipuram in Saka 1282. This

information is of interest for Vaishnava religious history, as it enables us to identify this first pontiff of the matha with the direct disciple of the great Vēdānta-Desika, the erudite scholar, keen controversialist and deeply venerated Vaishnava acharya,a whose literary and religious activities are said to have extended over a major portion of the 14th century A.D. 

As mentioned above, the inscription does not refer itself to the reign of any king, but it is somewhat peculiarly worded, in that it purports to have been issued by the deity himself. In the Tamil records of this temple, the god is called Arulāḷapperumal or Tiruvattiyur-nin raruliya-Paramasvamin, or 'the great Lord who was pleased to stand at Tiruvattiyur". The village-name Tiruvattiyur having been Sanskritised into Hastigiri, the god came to be known to Sanskrit authors as Hastigirīsa, by which name he is referred to in the opening verse of this epigraph. It is stated that on the representation made by the agent Perumaltātan and other Bhattas, the god, while seated in regal pomp with his consorts in the abhisheka-mandapa of the temple on the throne named Vīravallalan under the canopy called the Ariyenavallan-pandal listening to the chanting of the songs of Sathakōpa, was pleased to 

* Dēšika is believed to have been born in A.D. 1269, Šukla, and to have died in A.D. 1370, Saumya. The present record is of help in confirming the period of his literary activity as the second half of the 14th century A.D. 

* The artificial ramp formed by an enclosed mandapa is called the 'Tirumalai" or "giri', on top of which the shrine of Varadarāja is located.

confer the title of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar on a certain Vaishṇavadāsa and to put him in charge of a matha and its properties, so that he may propagate the tenets of the Rāmānuja-darṣanama to the Vaishnava laity, and maintain the library which he had collected, probably in the matha premises. A sentence at the end adds that this divine order (tirumugam) was engraved on stone by the temple-accountant. 

In regard to the particular style of wording in this inscription, couched as if the orders had emanated directly from the deity himself, it may be mentioned that this convention was adopted by some of the Vaishnava temples in the Tirunelveli District in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D., and in some instances. in the South Arcot and Chingleput Districts also. 

Before proceeding to examine the contents of this record, a few expressions occurring in it may be explained. 

(L. 2). Viravallalan simhasanam and Ariyenavallan-pandal are the names respectively of a throne and a canopy. The first was probably presented to the temple by the Hoysala king Vira-Ballāḷa III,5 

* Compare the verse composed in praise of this Jiyar : 

हस्तीशं लोकविख्यातं कौण्डिन्यं विदुषां वरम् । रामानुजार्य सिद्धान्तस्थापनाचार्यमाश्रये ॥ 

5 Ballāja III was camping at Kanchipuram in Bhavaka (Saka 1256) No. 401 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection. In two other records from the same temple, one of which is dated in Saka 1283, in the regime of Saluva Mangu, the god is described as seated in a similar manner while issuing the orders.iv 

while the second may have been named after some one having the title he who is as powerful as a lion," but whose title it was is not known. 

Nam pendugal-viz., Vishnu's two consorts, Śrī 

and Bhumi. 

Sathakōpan-pāṭṭu kēḷāniṛka-Śaṭakōpa is the name of the Vaishnava saint Nammāḷvār, whose Tiruvāymoli is considered equal to the Vēdas in sanctity and is chanted in the presence of the deity on particular occasions. Endowments made for this service in Vishnu temples are often mentioned in inscriptions. 

" 

(L. 3). Perumāḷtātaṇ-Perumāḷtātan or Perumāḷdāsaṇ would ordinarily mean 'a devotee of Perumal (Vishnu); but in this context it appears to have been the name of the agent, supervising the sacred business of the temple (nam vīṭṭu karumam kēṭkum), in whose presence and that of the Bhattas of the temple, the order is stated to have been promulgated. The name Vaishnavadāsa occurring in the same line has to be considered as meaning the servantdevotee of Vaishnavās rather than as the personal name of the donee in the record; for according to the Guruparamparā-prabhāvam, the original name of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar was Pērarulalyyan of Viravalli and his dasyanāma on 

on becoming a saṁnyāsin was Pērarulala-Jiyan.

(L. 4). Samārādhanamum adukku vēņdum muṭṭukkaḷum-seems to refer to the worship to be conducted to the deities kept in the matha itself and the requirements therefor. It is usual for every matha to have images of some deities for worship. In this connection, it may be noted that on the eve of the demise of Vēdānta-Dēśika, some images are said to have been bequeathed to his disciple Brahma-tantrasvatantra-Jiyar.8 

Postakangalum idukku vēņḍum upakaranangaḷum -By postakanga! (pustaka), manuscript bundles are apparently meant. The upakaranas are the accessories and paraphernalia required for running a library-such as probably racks for the accommodation of the manuscript bundles, spare sets of cadjan leaves for copying work, and stylus and other scribal apparatus.

the 'followers of Ramanuja.'10 The idea seems to be that the selection of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar as the pontiff was to receive the acceptance of Rāmānuja's followers and the Vaishnava laity (samayattil-uḷḷār). 

(L. 6) Ivanukku nām muḍittapaḍiyum uḍuttapadiyum pūsiņapadiyum kuduttōm-means that the flowers worn by the god, the clothes used by him and the sandal-paste and unguents utilised for his worship were presented to the Jiyar as a mark indicative of the god's love to the recipient. This expression is found used in some inscriptions11 and in Vaishnava literature. 

As regards Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the donee of the record, some information is available from Vaishnava literature. Among the South Indian religions, it was Vaishnavism alone that had developed the historical sense' to an appreciable extent, and there are therefore several biographies of the Vaishnava acharyas available, collated under the names of Vaibhavas and Guruparamparas of varying volume.12 One such work dealing with the life of the great Vaishnava reformer Vēdānta-Dēsika is the Guruparampara-prabhāvam13 in Tamil prose by Tritiya. 

10 The following expression from No. 51 of 1938-39 from Srirangam may be compared-Kodavar kövaṇavar nam bhaṭṭakal 

nam Rāmānujaṇai-uḍaiyār nam păduvăr, etc. 

11 Compare No. 567 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection. 1a There are many biographies of Dēšika available. The VedantaDesika-vaibhava-prakāšikā by Doddayācharya is in Sanskrit. 

13 Published in Madras in several editions. Dvitiya-Brahmatantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the acharya of the author of this work is said to have written the Pannīrāyirappadi-Guruparampara-prabhāvam which is not extant. 

[[vii]]

Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar. Shorn of the few miraculous elements that are inevitable in an orthodox hagiography this work compiled by an author who lived only a few generations later than Dēšika may be considered as fairly reliable. From it we gather the following details about Brahma-tantrasvatantra-Jiyar, the first of that name, who was a disciple of Vēdānta-Dēsika: 

"Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar belonged to the Kauṇḍinya-gōtra and was originally called Viravalli Pērarulalayyan. Well-versed in all the sastras he became an ardent disciple of Desika and assumed the saṁnyasa garb under the name of Pērarulāḷa-Jiyar. When the Ranganatha temple at Srirangam was looted by the Muhammadans in the first quarter of the 14th century Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar fled along with his acharya to Satyamangalam (in the Coimbatore District) and returned to Srirangam only after some years. He was taught the Bhagavadvishayam (Āṛāyirappadi) by Varadācharya alias Nayinārācharya, the son and disciple of VedāntaDēśikā, in Kali 4440, Bahudhanya, Avani śu, 2, Hasta (A.D. 1338, August 18). On one occasion, he vanquished a pandit of North India in a polemical contest at Srirangam and was honoured by Desika with the title of Brahma-tantra-svatantra '14 'he who is a master in Brahma-tantra'. That accounts. for the origin of the name by which he was popularly known. On another occasion during the 

L 

14 The present record conventionally states that god himself gave the title. 

[[viii]]

régime of Tirumalai-Śrīnivāsāchārya1 who had been installed by Dēšsika as the Śrīkārya-dhurandhara of the Kanchipuram temple, Brahma-tantra-svatantraJiyar overcame a Kashmirian pandit in a philosophical discussion and earned the title of Paryaya-Bhashyakāra',16 Some time later under the direction of god Venkatesa in a dream, he accepted the Trusteeship of the Tirupati temple, and during his tenure of office there, he installed an image of Vedanta-Dēsika in a matha built by him at Tirumalai, as well as in a maṇḍapa in the Gōvindarāja temple at Lower Tirupati. He stayed at Tirupati for a long time expounding the Vaishnava philosophy to his disciples Ghatikasatakam-Ammāḷ, Kidāmbi-Nayiṇār, KōmāṇḍurAchchan, Pillaiy-Appai, Pērarulāḷayyan-Appai, Kandāḍai-Aṇḍāṇ, Viravalli-Pillai and others. After his demise he was succeeded by PērarulāḷayyanAppai. Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar was the author of two small works-the Divyasuri-stuti1 and the Acharyavatāra-ghaṭṭārtha.18 

15 Guruparampara-prabhāvam, p. 138. He was the author of a religious work called the Prabandha-nirvāham. 

16 A verse composed by Ghatikāśatakam-Ammā! in praise of this Jiyar reads- 

पर्यायभाष्यकाराय प्रणतार्त्ति विधुन्वते । ब्रह्मतन्त्रन्त्राय द्वितीयब्रह्मणे नमः ॥ 

17 The colophon reads- 

ब्रह्मतन्त्र स्वतन्त्रोक्तां दिव्यसूरिस्तुतिं । 

18 Its colophon reads- 

ब्रह्मतन्त्र स्वतन्त्रेण परकालयतोन्दुना । आचार्यावतारघट्टार्थं संप्रहेण प्रकाश्यते ॥ 

[[ix]]

"Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar of the record under review may be identified with the disciple of Vēdānta-Dēšika, because of the fact that the investiture of this unique title of Brahma-tantrasvatantra', herein attributed to the god himself, had been made more than a decade prior to the demise of Dēšika and that this acharya's name figures in three important pontifical lists '.19 

The matha which was thus started at Kāñchipuram under the pontificate of this Brahma-tantrasvatantra-Jiyar in A.D. 1360 grew in importance and appears to have latterly removed its headquarters to Melkōte in the Mysore State, where it became popular under the name of the Parakala-matha.20 There were several scholars among the subsequent heads of this matha, and a short sketch of its history has been given in the granth-öpasamhāra of the Alankara-maṇihāra."1 

19 In this connection the following orthodox three-fold lists' may be noted: 

(a) Mantrārtha-guruparampara Emberumāgar, KidāmbiAchchan, Kidambi Rāmānuja Appullān, Srirangarājar, Appullar, Desikar and Brahma-tantra-svatantrar. (b) Sribhashya-guruparampara Emberumāņār, Tirukkurugaippiran-Pillan, Engalālvān, Nāgādūr-Ammāḷ, Appullar, Dėšikar and Brahma-tantra-svatantrar. 

(c) Bhagavad-vishaya-guruparampara-Same as in (b), Desikar, 

Nayiņārāchāryar and Brahma-tantra-svatantrar. 

20 See Palanaḍaivilakkam, Part II, p. 28. 

Published in the Mysore Sanskrit Series.

Vēdānta-Dēsika is stated in the Guruparamparāprabhavam to have been the contemporary of a certain Telugu chief named Sarvajña-Singhabūpāla and to have composed the Subhashitanīvi for his delectation. 22 The same chief is said to have honoured Nayinārācharya, the son and disciple of Desika, with the gift of a palanquin and other paraphernalia, when this acharya went to the northern parts in his religious tours. It follows therefore that Brahma-tantrasvatantra was also a contemporary of this Singa. 

"Another point of interest in this epigraph is the reference to a collection of manuscripts (or a library) which was kept in the matha and a stipulation made for its proper upkeep, as envisaged in the expression *iva tēḍiņa postakangaḷum idukku vēṇḍum upakaranangalum. It is well-known that in the medieval centuries, religious institutions of all denominations, Saiva, Vaishnava and Jaina, flourished in South India, either as a result of royal patronage or supported by private benefactions. They appear to have been primarily intended as seminaries for the imparting of religious education and incidentally for the dissemination of secular knowledge as well. The extensive properties granted from time to time to temples and to such religious establishments were left in charge 

22 Guruparamparā-prabhāvam, pp. 120 and 139. Two other works named the Tatvasandesa and the Rahasyasandēša are also stated to have been composed for the same purpose.

of the heads of these mathas called Maṭhādhipatis, Mudaliyārs or Jiyars, on whom devolved the duty of supervising the proper conduct of the services for which the endowments had been intended, and who, in turn, enjoyed some privileges as remuneration for their services.

TRANSLATION 

This is according to the sacred order. 

Hail! Prosperity! 

This is the order of the glorious Lord of Hastigiri, the god of gods, which is red with the brilliance of the gems in the diadems of the (supplicating) lords of the celestials and of the Asuras: 

"In the month of Mesha of the (cyclic) year Vikārin, on a Friday with prathama-tithi of the first. fortnight and Aśvati-nakshatra, while We, in company with Our consorts, were listening to the songs of Sathakōpa, seated on the throne (named) Viravallāḷaṇ under the canopy (called) Ariyenavallan in the abhisheka-mandapa (of the temple)— 

on the representation (made) by Perumaltātaṇ, who supervises the (sacred) business of Our temple (nam vidu), and by Our Bhaṭṭas, We were pleased to assign to a Vaishṇavadāsa on whom we had bestowed the name of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyan, the matha which had been set apart for him, the lands belonging thereto, the worship to be conducted therein and the expenses therefor, the books which he had accumulated and the accessories required for them (i.e., their maintenance), so that he may propagate Our Rāmānuja-darśanam, and after him, the disciples selected by him may, in succession, take possession of these and continue (the work). 

We directed that the followers of Rāmānuja (Rāmānujam-uḍaiyar) and those of our Vaishnava 

[[XV]]

samayam shall accept him (i.e., his pontificate) and carry on (the work). 

We also ordered that this information be engraved on stone and copper, and We presented him (in token of Our regard) what had been used (as garlands), what had been worn (as clothes), and what had been anointed (as unguents) by Us." 

As thus graciously commanded (by the god), this is the writing (or signature) of the templeaccountant Pērarulāḷapriyan. 

The Saka year in which this sacred order was written (engraved) is One thousand two hundred and eighty-two.

Archæological Department for the year 1938 

Kannada Sannad by Kanthirava Narasarāja Wodeyar (1639-59) 13th lunar day of the dark half of Jyeshtha in the cyclic year of Virodhi. 

"The Sannad is issued in the name of the King Kanthirava Narasarāja Wodeyar..... The Sannad records an order of the King that the practice of using the 'tanian' (invocatory verse) of Rāmānuja Dayāpātra in sacred places like the Tirunārāyanaswami temple at Melukote on the occasion of reciting Prabandhas (Tamil hymns) which was in vogue from the time of Raja Wodeyar, King of Mysore up to the reign of Kanthirava Narasaraja Wodeyar, should continue in the future also in the same manner as previously..... 

"This invocatory Sanskrit verse commencing with Rāmānuja-dayapātram....is stated to have been composed by Brahmatantraswami, disciple of Vedāntadesika and the reputed founder of the Parakala Mutt, in the Kali year 4490 Bahudhanya Sam. Avani Māsam Suk. 2 Hasta-nakshatra-which is equivalent to 18th August 1338 A.D., at Melukote and sanctioned by Vedāntadesika for use in the recitation and study of the Tamil Prabandhas. It is said to have received further support from the approval of the God Ranganatha at Srirangam in the year Sarvadhāri."

A copper-plate grant at Seringapatam, E.C. III Seringapatam 64 of A.D. 1722 of the King of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar I, son of Kanthirava Narasarāja Wodeyar II, refers to an ascetic named Srinivasa Yati, etc., etc. 

"According to the Annals of the Mysore Royal Family, Part I, p. 163, the priest who came from Tirupati as the above King's Guru is 'Dodda Parakalaswāmi'. The Mutt tradition identifies him with Srinivasa Yati of the above copper-plate and with Parakalaswami, Guru of Sreenivāsa Parakalaswami, in the Belur Sannad." 

SRI PARAKALASWAMI OR 

PERIYA (DODDA) PARAKALASWAMI 

Sri Dodda Parakalaswami referred to above (in the Annals of the Royal Family) is intimately connected with Magadi (Bangalore District), to whose chiefs he, as well as his ancestors, had been family Gurus. 

An extract from p. 15, para 55, of the "Annual Report of the Mysore Archæological Department for the year 1922" has the following:- 

to 

"Kempanāchi Gowda's son Virēgauda came Mysore from Alur, a village near Conjeevaram. He built the village Yelahanka and set up the God Gopalakrishna there, took possession of Bangalore and constructed a tank named "Kempāmbudhi". 

"His son Hiriyakempegowda (1588-1608) built in Bangalore a fort and four watch towers known as Vaiyālisikhara in the four directions. He went to Vijayanagar and received from King Krishnadevaraya Ballapura, Devanahalli and Hoscote." 

lii 

"Immadi Kempe Gowda captured Hulikal, Huliyurdurga and Sivaganga, took possession of Magadi and built on Savandurga a fort and the temples of Narasimha and Virabhadra. He also built at the instance of his family Guru Sreenivasadesikacharya, the navaranga or 

central hall of the Ranganatha temple near Magadi." 

"As there was some misunderstanding between his two sons Mummadi Kempegowda and Honnappa Gowda, he made a division of the kingdom and made the younger son Honnappa. Gowda the ruler of Hulikal in 1634, directing him to have Annayacharya of Hulikal as his Guru. On a representation made by his Guru Tiruvenkatacharya that ...... Subsequently Tiruvenkatacharya became a Sanyasi under the name of Dodda Parakalaswami and resided in the Matha at Seringapatam." 

"Kempavīrappa Gowda sanctioned a money grant to the Ranganatha temple at the instance of Dodda Parakalaswami who sent for consecration in the temple metallic figures of the goddess Lakshmi and Vedāntācharya. The scale of expenditure was also drawn up in consultation with the Swami's grandson Rāghavā.charya". 

"In 1711 the chief set up for his mother the God Cheluvarāyaswami in Cheluvarayapete to the south of Magadi with the assistance of Srirangacharya who had come there from Sreerangam, and in 1712 the God Varadarajaswami at Baichapura with the assistance of - his Guru Raghavacharya......."

Note. From the Annual Report of the Mysore Archæological Department for the year 1938. 

"This is a nirup addressed by the King Krishnarāja Wodeyar II of Mysore to Krishnayya of the Ayakat Department (a department organised by Chikka Deva Rāja Wodeyar for looking after the revenues and expenditure of the 84 districts of Mysore, accounts of the Military Department and Stores, personal receipts and expenditure of the King.......

"It is stated that this sum of 500 varahas was being met from various items of revenue belonging to Ayakattura Chavadi, the big stores and the small stores, the departments of Vichara Chavadi and Devasthana Chavadi. The present order substituted for this income of the villages Attani, etc., belonging to Andūra-Sthala belonging to Ayakathina-Chāvādi."

"The income of the three villages amounting to 500 varahas was ordered to be assigned to the Mutt of (the) Vedanta Parakalaswami and the villages were to be made over to the Mutt free from taxes and boundary stones were to be set up for the villages." 

"The nirup was to be copied by the clerk (Karanika) of the Chavadi (department) and to be then sent to the Mutt."

"This Sannad has a small seal with the letters Sri Krishna in Nagari characters on the top. Below are two small lines, the upper one containing the name. Ammanavaru and the lower one the name Krishnarajavadeyaravaru (II). Below there is the main body of the Sannad......

State from 1761 to 1782. The date of the grant is the 14th lunar day of the bright half of Margasira in the year Chitrabhānu......Devājammanni was the King's adoptive mother." 

"The Sannad begins with the statement that the villages Attani, Navaluru and Mungipatti situated in Anduru-Sthala were given away as ordered by the King's mother, free of taxes to the Mutt of Vedanta Parakalaswami, for carrying on the charities like the feeding of the Brahmins every day. 

"It is stated in the Sannad that sometime after the above villages came into the possession of the Mutt, a local agent (Sthaladalli baduku māduvaru) was demanding for himself the rent due to the Mutt and brought the villages under his authority and in various ways caused trouble. 

"The Sannad concludes with an order that as the said villages were granted for the feeding of Brahmins in the Mutt of Vedanta Parakalaswami, the local agent had no right to interfere in the above manner and he was to be ordered to make over the money exacted till then to the Mutt and to allow the Mutt to enjoy in peace the said villages and to prevent any molestation or obstruction to the Mutt in the enjoyment of the villages."

Mysore (15th September 1783 A.D.). 

"The "Nirup is addressed to Kuppaiya, Devasthānada-Sime-Pārupatyagar or manager of the department of temples in the State to the system of reciting invocatory verses in the temple at Melukote (see above). It is stated in this nirup that Anche Samiya (an officer under Tipu) was violating the old usage in the temple at Melukote regarding the use of invocatory verses and it was now ordained that both forms of invocation which begin with "Rāmānuja-dayapātra" and "Srisailesha-dayapatra" might be used. Further the Pārupatyadar was ordered to be fair to both the sects of Vadagalai and Tenkale (which used the above invocations) and to remove the image of Pillai Lokacharya (a saint of the Tenkale sect) to its original place at Melukote and to take the God in procession to Kesavaswami mantapa and other mantapas and distribute tirtha (sacred water) and prasada consecrated food offered to God during the Tirunakshatra and conduct the services with zeal in the usual manner...

Letter dated the 13th day of Magha M.I. in the year Sukla (1809 A.D.), from Dewan Purniah, to Srinivasachar, Parupathegar of Sri Rāmānuja Parakālaswami's Mutt. 

In your petition of the 7th instant you state that in all the Vishnu temples in this Province including that of Melukote, Vadagalay-Nāmās are borne, but for certain idols in the Swetavarahaswami's temple newly constructed and founded at the instance of Government, Tengale and Vadagalay Nāmās are both put on indiscriminately and that the cross stone beam of the Mahadwāra itself bears a Tengale Nāmā. You further mention therein that certain people have given this information to the Swami and that from the very commencement, Vadagalay sampradaya or observance prevails in this Province, and you ask for information as to the orders which have been given. 

According to the prevailing custom of putting the Vadagalay Nāmās on all the idols in all Vishnu temples in this Province, the Mahārāja of which is the principal disciple of the Srigalavaru's Mutt, Vadagalay Nāmās alone have been ordered to be put on and supplied to all the idols in Swetavarahaswami's temple as well as to its dhwajasthamba, vāhanās, silver vessels, peeta, prabhavali, etc. The stone beam which was on the doorway of the gopura in the old temple, was sent for and inspected. There was a mark of Tengalay Nāmā on the same. That has also been ordered to be changed. 

Communicate all these particulars to the Swami and inform him that the Mahā Mātusriyavaru (Queen Mother) has expressed a wish that he (the Swami) may once go [[lix]] to the temple, visit the Sri Swethavarahaswamy and accept thirtham and prasāda there. Report the orders which the Swāmi may give in this matter. +++(4)+++

"Salutation to the wise guru Vedanta who is a master of all tantras, who is a lion to poets and logicians. 

"I take refuge in the feet of Parakala Yatindra, which can only be attained by long austerities and which remove all torments of hell." 

Then the donees are named as the gods Hayagriva, and Lakshminārāyana in the Mutt of Parakalaswami. The gods are praised as the masters of the myriads of worlds and worshipped by the great Brahmatantra Ghantavatāra Parakāla. 

The prose passage in praise of the above guru may be translated as follows:- 

Adorner of the throne of the seventy-four families of Vaishnavās set up by the favour of the great ascetic Rāmānujācharya who is born in the earth under the orders of the Lord of Vaikuntha (Nārāyana) shining with royal grace on the seat formed by Anantha Sesha adorned with thousand pillared hoods in a divine jewelled pavilion which is the eye of the city of Vaikuntha rich with supernatural wealth and brilliant with the lustre of ten thousand suns, impossible to be fully perceived by mind or speech by Brahma and others and situated above in the Brahmānanda (universe) comprising several millions of worlds; and who is skilled in dispelling the pride of the wicked disputants and in the composition of the sacred commentary on the Sāriraka Sutras.

May the bar-like tusk of the sportive Boar form of Hari, resting on which the Earth with Meru as the pinnacle, bore the charm of a parasol, protect us. 

The Nirup next gives the date of the grant as S. 1738 Dhatu Sam. Magha Su. 10 Monday. The date is also given at the end (line 153) as 2nd (mistake for 27th) January 1817 A.D. its English equivalent.

The above eight villages, hamlets, tanks, kattes, anes and canals in the six taluks have been granted perpetually for the daily tadīyarādhana (worship or the feeding of the devotees) and services of the gods Hayagriva and Lakshmīnārāyaṇa free of all imposts.

APPENDIX VIII 

From the 28th of June 1836 to the 4th of April 1846, i.e., a period of ten years from his accession to the holy seat of Sri Brahmatantia, His Holiness Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakāla Swāmi may be said. to have prepared himself and his Royal Disciple, Mahārāja Sri Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar for the fulfilment of a great purpose, viz., the display of the cultural achievement of Mysore, within the period of fifteen years from the date on which the administration of Mysore was taken over by the East India Company leaving H. H. the Mahārāja free to devote himself to the attainment of cultural and spiritual eminence and to attain a position which may verily be compared to the one which King Janaka of Mithila had acquired in ancient times. In this task of co-operation between the King and his Guru, the distinguished Commissioners and their Assistants were steadfastly loyal and helpful to the Mahārāja and to his Guru. Thus the first decade of Sri Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakāla Swami's regime prominently brings forth the close contact between the Mahārāja and his Guru in all spiritual matters, including affairs connected with the management of temples, Mutts of all persuasions, Sabhas of Sanskrit pundits and encouragement of scholars, in Kannada, Persian, Urdu, etc. While the Swamiji's predecessor Sri Ghantavatāra Parakalaswami toured the Southern Indian regions (1811-16), which had been consolidated by the East India Company after the fall of Seringapatam and the Restoration of the Mysore Monarchy in A.D. 1799, His Holiness Sri Srinivasa projected to tour through

"DHARMADIGVIJAYAM" OF SRI SRINIVASA BRAHMATANTRA PARAKALASWAMI-PARABHAVA AND PLAVANGA 

(a) The first part of this journey was directed towards the south and south-eastern districts of Mysore. 

lxxxiv 

The main purpose of the journey was the establishment of an unbreakable spiritual link between the beloved sovereign and his loving subjects who looked at him as the fountain-head of Dharma based on Eternal Truth in consonance with the spirit underlying the motto engraved on the Royal Emblem of Mysore. 

"Sathyam eva Uddharamyaham" 

When the hereditary Guru of the State and its Sovereign himself went out as representative of the Sovereign, it was just natural that every class and every member of his prajā could visualise the spiritual influence which the Sovereign was open to. Hence it was that all classes of the subjects, officials and non-officials, zamindars and craftsmen, men and women, agricultural labourers, all had their due share in the royal and devoted welcome accorded to the learned sage and saint. If the Sovereign and his officials were themselves obliged to go out on inspection tours to establish close contact with their subjects to secure their loyalty and affection, was it not incumbent on the Guru who was the appointed custodian of the morals and the ancient faith to show himself as often as he could to the people inhabiting the areas remote from the few cities, the centres of administration? Those who had no opportunities to resort to the capital and view the pomp and splendour of royalty displayed on occasions like the Dasara and Royal Birthday celebrations, the Sri Krishna Jayanthi celebrations and temple processions, etc. could have these at their very doors on a small scale at least, to which a special religious flavour was conveyed. Womanhood in particular would be more subject to such religious processions involving temple honours on a grand scale, even superior to those offered to Royal personages, the 

lxxxv 

Poojas and Pādapoojas performed in their very homes. What would be the influence on the children and the younger generation? 

(b) The spots selected for putting up the camp would naturally be in the neighbourhood of villages and townships, where small rivers and lakes, topes, and famous shrines with their architectural excellences, displaying all that was grand and pious, and the spirit of sacrifice for God and religion. It was motives like these which prompted such tours by the occupants of the gadi of the "Paramagurus" of the Royal House of Mysore. 

(c) In the camps of these Gurus in their itineraries could be seen the most distinguished scholars of the age versed in the different branches of the ancient sacred lore. The discussions in the Sabha which were held wherever scholars could resort to easily would be an incentive to the younger generation who had the privilege of viewing these. 

(d) The importance of the village in shaping the morals of the country, the ideals which the members of the learned classes should pursue, the joy of engaging in common worship, irrespective of class and creed, the promotion of healthy competition amongst all classes and both sexes in the service of God, was naturally the most wonderful feature of the congregations resulting from these grand tours organised with such remarkable efficiency and supported by the State with such lavishness. It is for, the generation of to-day to visualise for itself these scenes of the near past, only a century ago, when the establishment of British Dominion over this sacred land of ours had not acquired perfect stability. Alas! what change has overtaken the people in this short period! 

lxxxvi

(It may be noticed here, that twenty-two years after, when the "Tiruppukuli", the receptacle enshrining the sacred body of His Holiness had to be opened for clearing it with a view to erecting "Brindavanam" over it, the amazing view presented itself to the gaze of the spectators, that of being the body was intact, with its posture unchanged, with the namams, the tiruppavitram, the Kāshāya vastram, the palm leaf manuscript in the left hand, and the gnanamudra in the right. Even the kusha grass asanam remained unaffected in the least, including the salt with which the holy had been covered up. The Yogindra is still there, in Samadhi. His present Holiness forthwith commanded that it should be covered up again and left as it was nearly a quarter of century ago, lest the Samadhi should be disturbed, and its continued exposure should bring in a terrible calamity to the world.)

ccciii 

Sri Venugopala Swami His Holiness returned to the Sri Mutt and the old town where the Brindavanam of the great Srī Rāmānuja Parakāla Swami stands. (The reader may be reminded at this stage that this most saintly Swami the founder of New Mysore after 1799, saw seventy-eight Chaturmāsyams having assumed Turiyashramam when he was only twenty-four years of age and lived up to hundred and two years, 1709-1811.) During his sojourn in Krishnapuram, extending the privilege of granting Vedanta Kalakshepam, Srimad Bhagavadvishayam, etc., to the large assembly of all the Srīvaishnavas who had flocked together from the villages around, such as Hemmige, Talakad, Sosale, Srirangarajapuram, Nadipuram, Dodda Abbagalu, Belakawadi, Kollegal and Satyagala, a deputation of the most influential of the Bhagavathas led by personages like the Sosale Jodidar Sri Tirumalai Srinivāsā-chariar, Sri Rangappa Thathāchāriar, constituted a sabha under the title "Sathyamangala Tirthāmrita Varshini Sabha" and prayed to His Holiness Sri Swamiji to grace the "Adhyakshatvam" of the Sabha. His Holiness having granted their request and adorned the seat, the leaders reviewed the history of Srivaishnavism in South India and pointed out the importance of Sri Vedantha Desikar's exile from Tamilnad, a life and death struggle between Hinduism and Islamic imperialism, the latter having brought about a cataclysm. This last was due to the concerted attack made by the Madura Sultans from the South and the armies of the Delhi Emperors from the North. The Hoysala Empire was virtually surrounded by the Islamic powers and it was left to the last Emperor Vira Ballala III (1292-1342) to start from Dwarasamudra, the capital, and move out to 

Srī 

ccciv 

the south to combat the menace to the Mysore Empire and to ancient Hinduism-it having considerably changed in its character during the century and a half of Islamic domination. Vīra Ballala, however, leaving the defence. of the northern and north-eastern parts of his dominions to the care of the five brothers Hakka, Bukka, Kampana, Mādappa, and Muddappa, acting under the directions of the saint Sri Vidyaranya Swami, moved out to the South and took up his position at Kannanur Koppam, eight miles from Srirangam. From there he organised the campaign, which ended in the overthrow of Malik Kaffur's creation, the Madura Sultanat (for which he dearly paid with his life, by being assassinated treacherously by one of the embassy which seemingly brought the terms of surrender under a white flag. The head of the decapitated body was subsequently hung up at the gate of Madura which was again closed up and the garrison prepared for a siege). The five brothers blessed by Sri Vidyaranya in the north, under the aegis of the eldest-now Sri Harihara-helped freeing of the menace. in that direction. 

It was during the terrible slaughter which was brought about in the strip of the Peninsula, comprising the present North Arcot, Chengalput and South Arcot countries, that Sri Vedantha Desika had to flee for his life (even as Srī Rāmānuja had to do it centuries before when a price was set on his head by the Chola Emperor) and seek shelter in the Mysore (Hoysala) country to save the lives of the two sons of Sri Sudarshana Bhattar, author of "Srutaprakashika" and also the manuscript itself, both having been entrusted to his care by the Bhattar who sacrificed himself. Sri Vedanta Desika having decided to stay in Satyāgālam for the time.

being, hoping to be able to return to Srirangam when the situation improved, started his Kalakshepams there, attracting to himself the large numbers of Srīvaishnavas in the adjoining country of the Hoysalas. The spot in the Sri Varadaraja's temple where the saint sat and conducted his "Kalakshepams" for twelve years came to be marked with the "Koormāsanam" to prevent the hallowed spot from being trodden by unholy feet. The deputation prayed to His Holiness to do something to mark this important link between Tamil Nad and "Kannada Nad" (to which Sri Vedanta Desikar subsequently proceeded to reside for a time-in Melukote (Tirunarayanapuram), with Sri Nārāyanāchāryar, his son, Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyer and other refugees, who had made up his following. 

23rd March 1927.-Sri Mangani Ram Seth, founder and endower of many religious and charitable institutions in Pushkar, etc., had darshan of Sri Swamiji at Krishnapuram itself, hearing that His Holiness had been sojourning there, when he came to Mysore and made enquiries. He was the guest of His Holiness for a day, and in the course of his interview he is said to have appealed to His Holiness to consider the advisability of undertaking a visit to Northern India--even as Sri Ramanuja did a thousand years ago--to remind the people of His teachings. If His Holiness had no objection "on the ground of the Shāstraic prohibition" he would make the journey by car as convenient as possible for His Holiness. The visitor left after expressing his profound gratitude to His Holiness for his expounding within a brief space of time the Vishistādwaita system of philosophy as expounded by Sri Vedanta Desika, the Founder of the Matham.

16th May 1927.-As the result of the deliberations in the sabha from day to day, beginning from the "Tirunakshatram" celebration of His Holiness Sri Ranganatha Brahmatranta Parakalaswami (16-5-1927) it was decided to call in subscriptions from out of which a hall might be constructed in front of the Koormāsanam adjoining the small Sannidhi which had been raised. round it, and make it suitable for lectures, kalakshepams, sabhas, for sevas like Sattumorai, etc. 

This was to be followed up by the installation of images of Sri Lakshmi Hayagriva and Sri Nigamantha Mahā Desika, near the "Koormāsanam" and conducting utsavams on every Sravana nakshatram and special utsavam on the first Sravanam day after Srī Vairamudi Utsavam at Melukote. In connection with the last, it was resolved that the extension to the building was to serve the purpose of conducting lectures on the works of Sri Nigamantha Desika in both Sanskrit and Tamil to enable those who would attend them, to integrate these teachings in daily practices and observances and manner of speech and consistently carrying out the principle of repairing and keeping fit the "Divyadeshams"-enjoined on the Srīvaishnava Acharyas. His Holiness gave the lead to start collection of subscriptions by making a contribution of Rupees 2,000. Out of this and subsequent collections, it became possible to purchase landed properties, out of the incomes of which the objects conceived above were to be achieved. Since then the Madras Hindu Religious Endowment Board has thought it fit to obtain the consent of His Holiness to his gracious acceptance of the position of Chief Trustee of the Srī "Gadadhara Swami" and Sri Varadaraja Swami temples at Satyāgālam.

The former stands on the Gaviraya hill and the image is also known as "Sri Chaturbhuja Rāma".

31st May 1927.-"Lagnapatrika" of marriage on 5-6-1927 of Sou. Sri Varalakshmiammannigaru, Rajakumāri of Gadwal with Sri Someshwara Rao, Raja of Donakonda, received in the Mutt (Krishnapur), being delivered in person by Vidwan Sri Harati Deekshacharya of Gadwal. His Holiness' blessings sought. 

1st June 1927.-At 8-30 in the morning His Holiness departed from Krishnapuram to return to Mysore, after Abhigamanam in the Sri Mutt and Seva at Sri Venugopalaswami's temple. On the way His Holiness accepting the invitation of Jodidar Sri Thirumalai Srinivasachariar of Sosale arrived at the outskirts of the Krishnaraja Agrahar on 2-6-1927, where temple honours from Sri Srinivasa Gopalakrishnaswami's temple were received. Having received the Poornakumbham and other maryādas, preceding them by Namaskarams, His Holiness was conducted to Sri Srinivasa Gopalachariar's residence. At the gate dhooli pādapooja was performed and sambhāvane offered, and His Holiness was conducted inside and entreated by that Acharya to instal the Sri Hayagriva and have the day's Ijya and the Sandhya Aradhanams in his house as also the far-famed 'vajradolotsavam' in the evening. The Swamiji condescended to grant the Acharya's prayer. All the vaidikas, laukikas, citizens, merchants, all castes and creeds of people and all the Government officials combined to make His Holiness*cccviii 

visit a triumphal progress. Sudras imposed upon every one of themselves a levy of one seer per head of rice and the accompanying lavājama, along with feeding, at their expense, for the elephants, the horses and the bullocks in the camp. All castes and creeds en masse joined in the Seva of His Holiness, and of Sri Hayagrīva. 

3rd June 1927.-His Holiness, breaking up his camp at Krishnapuram in the night and finishing the Abhigamanārādhana at Sri Tirumale Srinivasacharya in the morning, complying with the request of Srī Yajamāna Raghavacharyar, proceeded to Srirangarajapuram Agrahar with Sri Hayagrīva, escorted by all the Mutt honours to the house of the host and performed the noon ijyārādhanam there. This was followed by Samārādhane. In the afternoon His Holiness had darshan of the Utsavamūrthi of Sri Venugopalaswāmi at 4 o'clock and having offered dhoties and Mangalārathi received the temple honours such as Tirupparivattam, Tirumalai and thence returned to Sosale at 5 o'clock in the evening for performing the evening Bhagavadārādhanam and Samarādhanam in Sri Tirumalai Srinivāsāchāryar's house. After this His Holiness held an **Asthānam" in the hall of Sri Srinivasacharyar's house and addressed the big gathering for the space of an hour congratulating the host and his fellow Acharyapurushas the denizens adorning the banks of the Cauveri on maintaining the traditions and culture of the south unimpaired in spite of their opulence and worldly position, honoured by their sishyas and tenants of all castes and creeds so as to uphold the teachings of the ancient Alwars and Acharyas in the midst of modern changing conditions and become thereby shining examples of piety and devotion and equality towards all. 

cccix 

Sri Acharya then rose and submitted a suitable reply to His Holiness that as the occupant of the peetham of Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyer and the worshipper of Sri Hayagriva, the heritage left to Sri Vedanta Desikar, His Holiness by his own way of life had set the example for succeeding generations and after all they themselves were only small toys in the process. 

4th June 1927.-Arrival at Alanahalli Chatram in the morning. After Abhigamanam and the noon Ijyāradhanam, His Holiness started to Mysore at 1-30 P.M. and arrived at 3 o'clock in the Sri Matham. The usual first class honours from the Palace escorted His Holiness and the twenty-one guns salute was fired from the bathery. 

11th June 1927.-His Holiness' presence as usual at the Birthday celebration of His Highness the Mahārāja in the Palace. Pādapooja by His Highness and bestowal of thirthams by His Holiness followed by the conferring of khillats, garland with boquet, phalamantrakshate, etc., along with blessings on His Highness. This was followed by the presentation of phalamantrākshate along with garlands to Rajakumār Srī Desaraje Urs and Sirdar Sri Lakshmikantharaj Urs and Dewan Sri Sir Mirza Ismail. 

14th June 1927.-Visit of Sri Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya. Accompanied by Sri. C. Rāmānujiengar, Principal, Mahārāja's Sanskrit College, Mysore, Palace Assistant Secretary Sri Rama Rao and Sri V. Subrahmanya Aiyar, Retired Registrar of the Mysore University, the Pundit after duly performing pranamams, burst forth with the prayer "when will Your Holiness be pleased to grant the privilege of darshan at Benares by your presence?" These were exactly the words. The visitor then proceeded to describe graphically that at least in 

CCCX 

Northern India, Hindu religion in the matter of the numbers who profess it stood in great danger of losing its hold on the masses, that the faiths of Islam and Christianity had been making great strides among the lower classes, i.e., the so-called "untouchables". If this process went on unimpeded, like a tidal wave, it would overwhelm and engulf the Southern Indians also in no time, and the sense of security under which they were living may in all likelihood be jeopardised. Consequently if His Holiness could not straight away proceed to the North and grant "upadeshams" to the people there, His Holiness may at least be pleased to bless him with shāstraic authorities by the force of which he could himself, acting on that authority, do something to remove the sting of "untouchability" and offer hopes to that community that they may gradually elevate themselves to a position of equality with the caste Hindus by engaging in certain practices which may enable them to contemplate God and feel the joy and happiness of feeling that they were in constant companionship with God within themselves and thereby cease to think of their more fortunately born brothers in the faith as their enemies and oppressors. 

His Holiness the Swamiji gave a most patient and sympathetic hearing and promised to do his best to elevate the "Tirukkulattars" (as Bhagavan Srī Rāmānuja had done before) without conflict with the Dharmasastras, which had no provision for a class mistakenly called "Panchamas" although there were terms "chandālas" and outcastes, which was due to certain circumstances which had nothing to do with the "Varnashrama Dharma". If the Pundit would offer suggestions for improving the lot of these unfortunates, which would instil into their 

cccxi 

minds the hope that they could attain salvation, in spite of certain disabilities to which they were subject by continuing to remain under the Hindufold, His Holiness would consider them. But His Holiness felt that as far as he himself was concerned, instead of giving his opinion to that effect in his inaividual capacity, it would be more effective and authoritative if the question could be decided in a representative Sabha convened for the purpose. Sri Malaviya was extremely delighted and readily fell in with the idea of His Holiness and prayerfully begged His Holiness to convene a Sabha forthwith in the Mutt in the presence of the Deity under the Adhyakshata of His Holiness himself. 

Accordingly messengers were sent forth by His Holiness in every direction to invite the leading Vidwāns in the capital, the Dharmadhikāris, the Mahavidwāns, representatives of other important Mathams, prominent Laukikas, both non-official and official, to an emergent Sabha in the Mutt, in the afternoon at 3 o'clock. The response, though prompted by various feelings, was quick and ready. By 2 o'clock the Mutt hall became cramful in proportion to the importance of the subject. 

His Highness was represented by Amin-ul-Mulk Sir Mirza Ismail (later Dewan), Private Secretary and Sri Srikantha Lakshmikāntharāj Urs. The hall in the first floor of the building was found more suitable for this non-religious gathering. 

Exhaustive discussion followed under the Presidentship of His Holiness in which scholars like Mahāmahopādhyāya Sri Viroopaksha Sastrigal, Pauranikaratnam Sri Holavanahalli Seshachar and others and Srī Mālaviya had the largest share. 

At the conclusion of the meeting for that afternoon, 

cccxii 

His Holiness as Adhyaksha, after hearing arguments advanced by the different participants in the discussion, gave his opinion supported by the Shāstras that "Mantradeeksha" with some modification may be given to the "Tirukkulattars" without prejudice to their spirit. However, it being late for His Holiness' bath and evening worship, His Holiness proposed that the Sabha, if it found it necessary, might meet again on the morrow. The discussions and arguments were all carried in Sanskrit, but His Holiness while summarising the proceedings translated it all into Kannada to the joy and gratitude of the non-Sanskrit knowing portion of the audience. 

The next day the Sabha met and the opinion previously formed was confirmed by the final judgment of His Holiness. The Punditjee was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude and took leave of His Holiness feeling that he had been blessed. The foundation for the uplift of the Harijans was thus truly and well laid here, in the institution presided over by Srī Rāmānuja and in the Sri Sannidhi of Lord Sri Hayagrīva which he got as a gift from Devi Sri Saraswati at Kashmir. 

20th June 1927.-Arrival of the Honorary Superintendent of the Sri Mutt, Sri Mahavidwan Dharmadhikari Sri Tiruvallur Srinivasarāghavacharyaswami, bringing the khillats from the Sri Rani of Gadwal set apart as Sambhavane to Sri Swami at the marriage of Sri Sou. Varalakshmi Ammagāru. 

14th July 1927.-Chaturmãsya Sankalpa. His Holiness observed the ceremonials in the Manoranjan Palace bungalow in Alanahalli Chattram. At the "Panchashanti", in the afternoon, there were present among the huge assembly of Pundits, Palace officials, Dharmādhi-

The citizens of Kollegal had erected a beautiful pavilion where, under the headship of the President of the Taluk Board they had been eagerly waiting with offerings of flowers and fruits in trays in their hands, gave a warmhearted reception to His Holiness and escroted him through the decorated streets of the town with the Lord in front followed by Sri Swamiji behind. The multitude surrounding His Holiness and the Lord was representative of all castes and creeds and all stations in life, officials, merchants and vaidikas. Escorted by such an enthusiastic gathering, His Holiness granting darshan to all, reached Sri Lakshmīnārāyanaswami's temple by 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

cccxxii 

His Holiness in which Upadeshams were delivered in familiar conversational form. Phalamantrākshate and blessings having been conferred on the Assemblage His Holiness performed the evening worship which was largely attended; and the "Dolotsavam" took place in the midst. of great rejoicings and enthusiasm. 

Late in the night His Holiness started to Satyāgālam, His chief destination, and took up his abode in Str Varadaraja's temple. Before leaving Kollegal His Holiness conferred an amount (sambhavane) for being distributed among the scholars and teachers of the Veda Pathasāla. 

20th March 1929.-Camp at Satyāgālam. 

In the evening, complying with the request of the people, His Holiness with the Deities went in procession through the streets of Satyāgālam, to witness which citizens from Kollegal also had thronged. The Satyagālam camp had the look of an army of worshippers who vied with each other in offering their homage to the Deities and to the Acharya Swāmi. 

(In most of the functions connected with the Jeernoddhāram at Sri Varadarajaswami's temple in Satyāgālam Sri Assori Rajiengar figured most prominently, taking the leading part even from the moment that the sabha was launched forth.) 

At 7 o'clock in the evening the initial ceremony relating to the sanctification of the Mantap and the Koormāsana Jeernoddhāranam by installing Sri Vedāntadesikar's Vigraham over it, namely, "Ankurārpanam" was gone through.

At the Dolotsavam Sri Natarajaiya, Sangīta Vidwan, son of Sri Mallappa, President of the Kollegal Taluk Board, gave a brilliant performance in vocal music by way of seva to Sri Hayagrīva, which was extolled by the audience. Sri Assoori Rajiengar had 'Sevārtha' done at his expense. Before the Dolotsavam, a procession of the silver image of Srimad Abhinava Hayagrīva (installed in the Mutt by His Holiness the present Swamiji) Sri Bhashyakārar and Sri Vedantha Desikar in the "Prākāra" of the temple. 

22nd March 1929.-Camp: Satyāgālam. 

Srī Natarajaiya had Kashmir shawl conferred on him by His Holiness along with phalamantrakshate and blessings. During the four days' sojourn in Satyāgālam, a large number of seekers after Brahmavidya had the benefit of His Holiness' Upadesham. Having thus recalled history by this Jeernoddhāranam, His Holiness established a spiritual link between South Tamil Nād and Melnād (Mysore) country, which future generations may strengthen and develop further. That hope is justified by the fact that, soon after, the Madras Government took adequate measures to the proper conduct of the services by authorising the Hindu Religious Endowments Board to appoint trustees to supervise the temple, one permanent trustee being the "Mathādhipathi of the Sri Parakalaswami Mutt in Mysore and his successors in that office from time to time" in the Board's Order No. 791 dated 31st of July, the year 1931 formulating a "Scheme".

meeting at Krishnapur of the "Satyamangalatirthāmritavarshini Sabha", and with the start made by His Holiness Sri Swamiji by the gift of Rs. 2,000 the Sabha had been able with subscriptions to construct a spacious mantap, in front of the shrine containing the Koormasanam at the spot where Sri Nigāmantha Mahādesikar had conducted his kalakshepam for twelve years. His Holiness had now been invited to throw open this hall and to instal the sanctified image of Sri Vedantha Desikar on the Peetham itself. It was a part of the "Jeernoddharam" of the Divyadeshas which was incumbent on the Vaishnava Acharyas that His Holiness wished to accomplish as far as it lay in his power. 

This was the first of such acts that His Holiness accomplished after two years of its inception. [Other similar projects carried out by His Holiness were the repairs and new extensions to the old Sri Mutts at 

1. Tirumalai Hills. 

2. Magadi (the place where Sri Periyaparakāla Swami dwelt (in his poorvāshram). 

3. Melukote.

Some sevas have also been instituted newly there such as 

Mangalashasanotsavam", "Tirunakshatrotsavam" of Sri Nigamantha Desikar, "Anushtānakolotsavam", etc. To supervise and have the services conducted duly and to maintain the structures in proper trim a local agent 

CCCXXV 

has been appointed by the Sri Swamiji, the present incumbent in that office being Sri A. Balasundaram Modaliar Avargal. 

4. At Dhanushkoti, Sri Pattanna Thathacharyar, on 30-10-1939 handed over to the Sri Mutt Sri Rama's temple, himself being allowed to act as the Agent during his lifetime (through a settlement deed).

6. At Alwār Tirunagari, Tiruchendur Taluk, Tirunelveli District, a shrine of Srī Desikar in the "Adinathan" temple jurisdiction, which had been visited by Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyer, the founder of the Sri Mutt, Sri Nayanār Acharyar and other holy men having fallen to sheer neglect (those who had been responsible for the services there having taken up more lucrative jobs) and His Holiness having been appraised of the situation, contacted them and acquired for the Mutt the right of conducting the services through agents appointed by the Mutt, by paying a considerable amount to them, the necessary documents having been duly executed by the members of the family enjoying the rights of worshipping Sri Vedantha Desikar through a gift deed. 

7. In the State of Hyderabad, lying within the Estate of Sri Sivarāja Bahadur, the temple of Anjanagiri Sri Balaji and the village (Agrahar) Shapoor, was granted to Sri Mutt in perpetuity (the "Muttavalli") by the Honourable Srī Rāja Dharmakuran Bahadur Asaf Jhahi. The property since then is being administered by an Agent for the benefit of the temple's services. Hiscccxxvi 

Holiness Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Swamiji's great grandfather Sri Appalachār received it as a gift (Makhta) from Rāja Sri Chandu Lal, the celebrated minister of Hyderabad, in a Sanad, for lighting the perpetual lamp and conduct Nivedana, Utsavams, etc., in Hizira 1238. 8.

There His Holiness stayed the whole day and conducted the three “Ārādhanams"-the morning's Abhigamana, the noon's ijya and the evening's worship. The expenses for the whole day were met by Sri Srinivasiengar.

It will be relevant at this point to mention that the various Endowments which His Holiness has made during nearly a quarter of a century has been rendered possible by the hearty and steadfast co-operation tendered by the various officials of the Government beginning with Rajamantrapravina Srī A. V. Ramanathan, who, in response to the desire exressed by His late Holiness Sri Vāgisha Brahmatantra Parakalaswami and under the direct command of His Highness, took over the management of the landed properties of the Sri Mutt on behalf of the Government. According to this arrangement, after making the necessary deductions, the net income from the lands was to be handed over to the Sri Mutt along with the accounts. In the first instance, the arrangement was to be treated as an experimental and a temporary measure, to find out whether the innovation would be conducive to the advantage of the Sri Mutt. The result showed that His Holiness was thoroughly justified in starting the experiment. His successor, the present Holiness Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Yatindra, realising the advantageousness of the scheme, was pleased to direct that the arrangement should continue indefinitely. 

Yet another arrangement for the sound conduct of the affairs of the Sri Mutt was made by His Holiness with the approval of His Highness the Mahārāja, immediately after his accession to the Peetham. It may even serve as a model for similarly placed institutions all over the country. It is the constitution of an "Advisory Committee" to help His Holiness by proffering advice in all worldly affairs connected with the administration of the Sri Mutt. The Committee is also empowered to scrutinise the administration, have the accounts periodically audited by duly qualified auditors and guide and 

cccciii 

advise the officials. This has contributed much to the peace of mind and relief from anxieties of His Holiness, who, however, has wisely reserved to himself all matters connected with the moral and spiritual welfare of the institution in his own hands, to enable him to carry out the injunctions of Sri Varadaraja Swami of Kanchi to the founder of the Sri Mutt Sri Periya Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyer, and thus to carry on the work of Sri Rāmānuja and Sri Nigamantha Mahā Desikar, the Paramacharyar of Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra. The members of the Committee when it was first constituted 

were:- 

1. Sri Rao Bahadur M. C. Ranga Aiyangar, B.A., 

B.L., Advocate (President).

The late Gurusevāsakta Sriman Dharmādhikāri Tiruvallur Srinivasa Raghavacharyar as "Honorary Superintendent" was extremely helpful to His Holiness in trying to realise many of the aspirations of Sri Swamiji towards enlarging the sphere of the activities of the institution:- 

1. By starting the "Vedantha Desika Vihara Sabha". 

2. By opening of a Vidyāsākha in the Mutt- 

(a) to give such training to the pundit students as will fit them to undertake missionary work of a 

cccciv 

character which will help preserve the orthodox faith without coming into conflict with the present advance of modern ideas in the spiritual field; 

(b) to start similar institutions in places like Kanchipuram and provide recurring monthly and annual grants to them; 

(c) to educate and train the younger scholars to study the shastras, to recite the Vedas and the Divyaprabandhams, to help as purohits versed in "Poorva and Apara Prayogams" and thus help the community at large in the performance of sacred rites and to serve as a "Gurukula" under the personal supervision of His Holiness; 

(d) to grant some aid to students of High Schools and Colleges-irrespective of caste in the shape of grants to institutions like the "Anāthālaya", the "Vidyodaya Sabha", "Vedantha Desika Grantha Pracharini Sabha", the "Ubhaya Vedantha Pravarthana Sabha" (Melkote), etc.; 

(e) to grant "padies" to students of all castes, to students coming from outside, and to those who are studying in the Sanskrit Colleges and to establish "Sakha mutthas" like those at Bangalore, Māgadi, Kanchipuram, Ramanathapuram, Sathyāgālam, Allahabad; 

(f) to acquire Sannidhis for worship by agents appointed by the Sri Mutt at Srirangam, Dhanushkodi, Alwar, Tirungari, Tirukkurangudi, Fateh 

Fateh Darwaza (Hyderabad), Shahpur (Mahabubnagar District, Hyderabad), etc.; 

(g) to help publish reprints of great works like:- 

(i) Sri Parakāla Yatindra Granthamāla Series (Telugu characters, edited and published by Sri P. B. Annangar Āchāriyar of Sri Kanchi), 

(ii) Sri 

CCCCV 

Nityānusandhānam, 

Tiruvoimuzhi 

(Mudal Ayiram), Sri Desika Prabandham (Telugu characters, published by the Sri Mutt); 

(h) to print voluminous standard works-for all times-written by His Holiness himself, the chief being 

of which 

(i) Sri Hayasira Upākhyānam, 

(ii) Vyakhyānam Hayasiroratnabhūshanam, (iii) Sarvārtha Siddhi Vyakhyānam, Volumes I-III (Mysore Government Oriental Library); 

(i) to print in the form of "Upanyasa Māla❞ 

(i) Summaries of lectures delivered by His Holiness himself at the Sabhas in the Sri Mutt, 

(ii) by the Vidwans of the Sri Mutt and of the 

Government Training College, 

(iii) the Sanskrit College and other institutions on the Darshanas, Agamas, Sanathana 

Dharma, as also on social, religious and dhārmic subjects 

at the big meetings presided over by His Holiness; 

(The vast additions made to the Sri Mutt 

Library; 

(k) individual donations to help construction of buildings for educational institutions like the Sărada Vilās Educational Society (Rs. 2,000), Krishnarajpet High School (Rs. 1,000), "Brahmana Vidya Sahāya Sangha” of Bangalore (Rs. 1,000), Vedasāstra Poshini Sabha, Mysore (Rs. 1,000) and numerous other conferences, associations, etc., in a smaller degree; 

ccccvi 

(1) the erection of the Divya Mantap to enshrine the Deities (silver, weighing 25,000 tolas), as also the Koormapitham; 

(m) providing several more silver and gold vessels, etc., for the Deities' use in daily worship and on special occasions, the silver cradle being one of them; 

(n) consecration of Sri Lakshmi-Hayagriva image to enable the worshippers to have a correct idea of the original image worshipped by Sri Saraswati, Sri Rāmānuja, Sri Tirukkurukai Piran Pillān, Sri Nigamantha Mahā Desikar and Sri Brahmatantra Swatantra Jeeyer; 

(o) construction and consecration of the well "Sri Hayagriva Pushkarani" in the garden (tulasi and flowers) adjoining the Sri Mutt (Rs. 19,000); 

(p) the crowning of the tower gate of the Mutt with gold gilt kalashams (Rs. 6,000) and consecrating the same. 

3. Another scheme started by His Holiness the present Swāmi clearly demonstrates the correct understanding of the difficulties of the servants in the employ of the Sri Mutt from the economic point of view. It is the starting of the Provident Fund Scheme within a period of three years after his accession to the Peetham. This has enabled him to assure continuity to the tenure of service of the workers amongst whom are a large number of Vidwans who have passed the Vidwat Examinations of Mysore and the 'Siromani' examinations of Madras. Some of them are granted liberal scholarships-not to speak of other emoluments which they receive at the gatherings, such as the annual Veda Shāstra Vidwat Bahumāna Sabha-incidental to Chaturmasya Sri Vedānta Desika Vihara Sabha, etc. The Scholarships are intended to enable them to engage in further advanced studies 

ccccvii 

pre-eminently in Sri Vishistādwaita Vedantha and enable them to propagate the Srīvaishnava cult in the country. 

It will thus be seen that His Holiness, like everyone of his thirty-two predecessors in the holy peetham, has been giving every moment of his life for Service-which is his motto-to further the objects which the last great Hoysala Emperor Sri Viraballāla III of Mysore was enjoined to achieve as also his successors on the Mysore Throne, of Course-by Sri Varadaraja Swami of Kanchipuram Himself, their subjects and the peoples of the South in general. May Sri Lakshmi-Hayagriva Divya Pādukā Sevaka Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Brahmatantra Parakalaswami live long to continue the task allotted to him by God, to the fullest span of his life which may be allotted to him by God, even like Srī Rāmānuja Parakalaswami, Sri Vedantha Desika and Sri Bhagavan Rāmānuja!
