SrI Rangarajar performed upadeSams on the meanings which he had received from SrI Ramanuja PiLLAn for his SishyAs. During Kali Yugam, Vikrama samvatsaram, Chittirai month, when ArudrA nakshatram was in ascendance, a son was born to SrI Rangarajar. The child was the amSam of a nityasUri, SupratishThar. The child was named with the same name as that of his Guru, Ramanuja PiLLAn. At the appropriate time, the samskArams like upanayanam were carried out. Ramanujar was a genius to acquire all VidyAs from his days as a youth. Elder scholars who saw Ramanujar wondered whether he is appiLLAn (Ramanuja PiLLAn). From then on, he was called appiLLAr.

SrI Rangarajar taught his son appiLLAr, the esoteric meanings that he had gained from KiDAmbi AcchAn, who served as the cook for AcArya Ramanujar. AppiLLAr performed KAlakshepams on SrI BhAshyam and others under from Nadadur Ammal. The scholars gave appiLLAr the honorific title of "vAdihamsAmbhuvAhar" in view of his victory over the vAdis. appiLLAr had also a daughter named "totAtryambai" (totArambA).

After a few years, Rangarajacharyar ascended to Paramapadam. After that, appiLLAr taught SrI BhAshyam and other granthams to his SishyAs. The janma nakshatram of appiLLAr's father, Rangarajacharyar was Panguni RohiNi. appiLLAr has authored nyAyakuliSam and other granthams.

The taniyan for appiLLAr: नमो रामनुजायार्य वेदान्तर्थप्रदायिने। आत्रेयपद्मनाभार्यसुताय गुणशालिने॥ [[101]] namo rAmanujAyArya vedAntArthapradAyine | Atreya padmanAbhAryasutAya guNaSAline ||
