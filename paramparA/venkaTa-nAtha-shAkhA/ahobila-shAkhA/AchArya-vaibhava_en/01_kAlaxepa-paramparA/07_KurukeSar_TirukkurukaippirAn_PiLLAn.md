KurukeSar, an amSam (incarnation) of PracANDar was born in Kali Yugam during a SrImukha year, when pUrADa (pUrvAshADhA) nakshatram was in ascendance. He belonged to SaThamarshaNa gotram. He was the second son of Periya Tirumalai Nambhigal, who named his son as "PiLLAn". From his childhood days, PiLLAn was listening to his father interpreting the meanings of the pAsurams of TiruvAimozhi and reflected on them even when he was playing. PiLLAn became a disciple of EmperumAnAr and learnt the meanings of all SAstrams form his AcAryan. PiLLAn created a commentary known as "TiruvARAyirappaDi" following the command of his AcAryan. Udaiyavar named that commentary as "Bhagavad Vishayam" and ordered that this commentary be included along with the kAlakshepa granthams like Sri BhAshyam. Following his own AcAryan Alavandar's wish and command, EmperumAnAr gave the name of SvAmi NammAzhvAr to PiLLAn. From then on, the name of PiLLAn came to be known as "TirukkurukaipirAn PiLLAn". EmperumAnAr made PiLLAn as one of the SrI BhAshya simhAsanAdipatis and commanded PiLLAn to perform kAlakshepams and be his successor after his own ascent to Paramapadam. PiLLAn followed his AcAryan's command and conducted ubhaya VedAnta kAlakshepams at Srirangam.
