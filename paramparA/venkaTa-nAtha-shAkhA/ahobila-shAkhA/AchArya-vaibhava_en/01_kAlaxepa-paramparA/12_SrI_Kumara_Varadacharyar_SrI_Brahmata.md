SvAmi DeSikan's tirukkumArar SrI Kumara Varadacharyar popularly knowa as SrI NayinArAchAryar was born with the divine blessings of DevAdirAja Perumal of Kanchipuram. As said by the vAkyams "pituHSatAguNam putraH", he had all the guNams like his father, SvAmi DeSikan. He was a scholar of par excellence. He was giving discourses on the sampradAya granthams at Srirangam along with SrI Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi. After his father attained Paramapadam, he stayed in Srirangam for a year. He concluded all the year long rituals for his revered father. Then he started on sancAram along with Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi to perform MangaLASAsanam of several divya deSa EmperumAns and to win over the debates with scholars of other religious belief and establish ViSishTAdvaita sampradAyam.

He went on sancAram to Tirupperai and other divya deSams in southern part. After the MangaLASAsanams of the EmperumAns in these divya deSams, he arrived at TanjaimAmaNi Koyil. He won over scholars of other religious faith and was propagating ViSishTAdvaita siddhAntam. The Chieftains of the territories nearby extended all courtesies and paid their obeisance to him. Both the SvAmis stayed at TanjaimAmaNi koyil for a few days. At that time, one SrI VaishNava in that place attained Paramapadam. The twelve days ceremonies were conducted. One of the relatives of the SrI VaishNava who attained Paramapadam came to the place where SrI NayinArAchAryar and SrI Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi were camping and prostrated before them. He asked them, "Since nAlAyira divya prabandhams are not to be recited during anadhyayana kAlam which comes after tirukkArtikai, what SrI sUktis are supposed to be recited during this period?" Both of them discussed over this and directed him to recite during anadhyayana period, the taniyans of nAlAyira divya Prabandhams and DeSika Prabandhams.

[[134]] At the sannidhi of Neelamegha Perumal, taniyans of nAlAyira divya Prabandhams, irAmAnuca nooRRAndati, SvAmi Desikan's amrutaranjani, PrabandhasAram etc., and PiLLaiyandAti composed by NayinArAchAryar were recited. Both the SvAmis directed the SishyAs and others to recite as per the direction of EmperumAnAr, nAlAyira divya Prabandhams and then DeSika Prabandhams after anadhyayana kAlam, i.e., in adhyayana period also.

The arcA vigrahams of AzhvAr, EmperumAnAr and SvAmi DeSikan were consecrated by them at the sannidhi of Neelamegha Perumal. The arcA of SvAmi DeSikan was also consecrated in the same alamkArAsanam (eka simhAsanam) as of that EmperumAnAr.

From TanjaimAmaNi koyil they both went to Tirukottiyur, TirumAlirumcholai, Srivilliputtur, AzhwAr Tirunagari et al and had MangaLASAsanam of these divya deSa EmperumAns. Then they went to Kerala deSam (malai nADU) and worshipped the EmperumAns there. The local kings extended honours to them. Some disgruntled persons who were practitioners of black magic could not bear to witness the honours being extended to the two SvAmis. They invoked black magic on the tirumaDaipaLLi kaimkaryaparars (kitchen area paricArakars/cooks) of NayinArAchAryar SvAmi. The kaimkaryaparars felt like carrying big boulders of rock on their heads. NayinArAchAryar noticing this invoked a mahA mantram to send two coconuts to those magicians. SvAmi kept a small blade of grass on his head. This made the magicians to feel as if big boulders of rock pressing on their heads. The coconuts also started beating them. The magicians were terrified and prostrated at the feet of NayinArAchAryar and pleaded for forgiveness. SvAmi pardoned them and let them go off.

Then both the SvAmis started on their yAtrA to Tirunarayanapuram. They did their MangaLASAsanam of Yadugiri Nacchiyar and Tirunarayanan. From there, they proceeded to offer their MangaLASAsanam to EmperumAnAr who had showered abundant grace on them. They stayed at Tirunarayanapuram for a few days. There, they consecrated the arcA of SvAmi DeSikan. From there, they went back to Srirangam.

At Srirangam, on the auspicious Panguni Uttiram sErti sEvA day when the divya dampatis were together in eka simhAsanam, they recited the pAsurams '‘என்னது யான் செய்கின்றேன் ennatu yAn ceykinREn" and "நின்னருளாம் கதியின்றி மற்றோன்றில்லேன் ninnaRuLAm gatiyinRi [[135]] maRRonRillEn". Then, on the divine direction of Sriranganathan they recited DeSika Parabandham.

On one occasion, both the SvAmis started on their travel for the divya deSams in the northern part. They reached Tiruvaheendrapuram where they offered MangaLASAsanam of Senkamala Nacchiyar and DevanaAthan. Then they went to aushadagiri (hill) where Periya tiruvaDis (GarudAzhvAr) and SrI Hayagreevar showered their blessings on SvAmi DeSikan. There they consecrated the arcA of SrI Hayagreevar.

From Tiruvaheendrapuram, they reached Perumal Koyil (Kanchipuram). Both the SvAmis built a sannidhi for SvAmi DeSikan at Tiruttanka, the avatAra sthalam of SvAmi DeSikan and there consecrated the divya mangala vigraham of SvAmi DeSikan. When these two MahAns were camping in Kanchipuram, the VaikAsi fesitival of SrI Devadirajan was going on. Some persons of other religious faith prevented the recital of divya Prabandhams in the streets when SrI Devadirajan was taken on a procession. They further said divya Prabandhams can be recited only if they are won over in a debate. The two SvAmis defeated them in the debate. The recital of divya Prabandhams was lead by them from the second day of the festival. After the festival concluded, they consecrated the arcA of SvAmi DeSikan at PeraruLALan sannidhi. They then went on their yAtrA to Tirumalai.

SrIkArya Kaimkaryam at the sannidhi of Srinivasan

Both the SvAmis reached Tiruppati and did MangaLASAsanam of SrI Govindarajan. Then they went to Tirucchanur to worship Alarmelmangai tAyAr. Next they went to Tirumalai and after the MangaLASAsanam for Tiruvengadamudaiyan, partook the tIrtha prasAdam etc. That night Tiruvengadamudaiyan appeared in the dream of Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi and directed him saying, "Tirumalai jIyar who was rendering service in Our sannidhi has attained Paramapadam. Hence from tomorrow onwards you take charge of the SrIkArya kaimkaryam of Our sannidhi, remain here at Tirumalai by offering discourses on the siddhAntham". Perumal also appeared in the dream of the temple officials and said, "We (Perumal) have ordained the jIyar who has come to Tirumalai to take charge of the SrIkArya kaimkaryam of Our sannidhi. You may follow his guidelines and administer the duties related to Our sannidhi. You hand over the keys, seals etc., of Our sannidhi to the jIyar”. [[136]] At dawn, Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi informed NayinArAchAryar about the dream. After sunrise, the temple officials approached the jIyar and handed over the keys etc., and prostrated at his feet. They narrated the dream that they had and prayed to SvAmi to take charge of the SrIkArya kaimkaryam of the sannidhi. NayinArAchAryAr who was near by told the jIyar, "Similar to the sampradAya discourses conducted by us, BhagavAn has blessed you to take charge of the SrIkArya kaimkaryam of the sannidhi. This is a very auspicious blessing. You take charge of the same as per the divine order of BhagavAn". The jIyar immediately proceeded to the sannidhi of Tiruvengadamudaiyan. When he neared the Bali pITham, SvAmi, invoked the lineage of AcAryA (Guru ParamparA), did his praNAmams to enter the sannidhi. SvAmi did MangaLASAsanam of Srinivasan. At that time, Srinivasan formally appointed SvAmi through the arcaka (arcaka mukhene) as the SrIkAryam. SvAmi accepted the niyamanam. SvAmi was rendering the SrIkArya kaimkaryam in an exemplary manner.

NayinArAchAryar went to Ahobilam and other divya deSams in North and had his MangaLASAsanam of the EmperumAns of these places. At that time, one person by name SAkala Mallan, a staunch activist belonging to other religious faith, launched a demonic spirit (brahmarAkshas) on SvAmi. NayinArAchAryar, learning about this, with his power of MahA mantram made the demonic spirit to carry his palanquin. On noting this, the magician surrendered at the feet of SvAmi.

SvAmi met a king named dASarAjA on the banks of Godavari River. SvAmi blessed the King with VaishNava dIkshA and named him as dASarati Raja. Since he was deeply devoted, SvAmi taught him the Sanskrit grantham of sArArtha sangraham and other works and presented him with vigraham of SrI DeSikan for performing nityArAdhanam. Then he travelled to northern parts of the country, completed tIrtha yAtrA and returned back to Perumal Koyil. Here, he was blessing his disciples with the teachings of the sampradAya granthams.

Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi got built a maTham at Tirumalai and consecrated the vigraham of SrI DeSikan. He also consecrated a sannidhi for SrI DeSikan at the sannidhi of Govindarajan in Lower Tiruppati. He was offering religious discourses to his disciples GaTikASadam Ammal, KidAmbi NayinAr, KomAnDUrAcchAn PiLLaiyappai, PeraruLALaiyanappai, KandAdai ANDAn, Veeravalli PiLLai [[137]] and others. He was also administering the SrIkAryam kaimkaryams of the Tirumalai Temple.

At one time, SvAmi had a health setback. Immediately he initiated PeraruLALaiyanappai in to the ascetic order, directed him to accept the SrIkArya kaimkaryam and SrI Hayagreeva ArAdhanam and conduct religious discourses. He blessed GaTikASadam Ammal and KidAmbi NayinAr with certain esoteric works and advised them to conduct religious discourses. On the niyamanam of Tiruvengadamudaiyan, SrI Brahmatantrasvatantra SvAmi meditating upon the holy feet of SrI SvAmi DeSikan attained Paramapadam. NayinArAchAryar organized the final rites through Veeravalli PiLLai.

His tirunakshatram - PurattAsi month, SravaNam

NayinArAchAryar stayed permanently at Kanchipuram. He created adhikaraNa cintAmaNi, a commentary for SvAmi DeSikan's grantham of adhikaraNasArAvaLi. He was doing upadeSam on this commentary to his disciples. At that time, one sanyAsi on the bad advice by SAkala Mallan came to Kanchipuram. He challenged NayinArAchAryar and told SvAmi, "Unless you win over me in a debate, you cannot do any discourses on siddhAntams". NayinArAchAryar called one of his disciples named aNNan, sprinkled him with the water empowered with the chanting of Hayagreeva Mantram and asked him to partake the tIrtham and directed, "You go and defeat the sanyAsi in the debate and come back". aNNan said, "With the power of your blessing, I will be able to win over the other religious scholars well versed in all SAstrAs. Thus saying, he proceeded to the debate hall. He called the sanyAsi for debate. The sanyAsi entered the hall making a lot of fanfare and looked at aNNan arrogantly and asked “kA pUrvaH? (Which is your pUrvIkam?). aNNan replied, “kAncIpUrNaH". The, vedAnta debate started. In due course, the sanyAsi was defeated. He prostrated at the feet of aNNan. The sanyAsi wished to see [[138]] NayinArAchAryar. aNNan took him along. NayinArAchAryar called aNNan, "Oh PrativAdi Bhayankaram aNNan, welcome" and blessed him. From that day onwards, all called him as "PrativAdi Bhayankaram aNNan" (a terror to those who come for debate). SvAmi initiated him on all the VedAnta granthams, and sent him to Srirangam for conducting religious discourses there.

As the health condition of this great AcAryA deteriorated, SvAmi called his close SishyAs, GaTikaSadam Ammal, KidAmbinayinAr, PrativAdi Bhayankaram aNNan, EmperumAnArappan and directed them to do pravacanam/discourse on the siddhanta granthams. SvAmi meditating upon PerAruLALan, partook the pAdukA tIrtham of SvAmi DeSikan, kept the padukAs on his head and mediated on SrI DeSikan's tiruvaDis.
