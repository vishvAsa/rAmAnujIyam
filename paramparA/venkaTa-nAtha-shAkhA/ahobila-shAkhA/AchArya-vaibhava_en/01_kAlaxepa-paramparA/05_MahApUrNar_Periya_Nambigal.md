During Kali Yugam, in HeviLambi year, mArghazhi month when JyeshTha nakshatram was in ascendance, a child was born as the amSam/incarnation of KumudAkshar at Srirangam in BhAradvAja gotra. He was known as Periya Nambhigal. He was the pradAna Sishya (principal disciple) of SrI Alavandar. As per the command (niyamanam) of his AcAryan, Periya Nambhigal stayed at Srirangam and was conducting upadeSams to his disciples, the traditional granthams of SrI ViSishTAdvaita siddhAntam. His six SishyAs are EmperumAnAr (Ramanuja), Malai kuniya ninRAr, Arya SrISaThakopa dAsar, aNiyarangattamudanAr, tiruvAikkulamudaiyAn Bhattar and Tirukkacchi Nambhigal.

(As his caritram is linked closely to the Vaibhavam of EmperumAnAr, no separate descriptions of them are included here).
