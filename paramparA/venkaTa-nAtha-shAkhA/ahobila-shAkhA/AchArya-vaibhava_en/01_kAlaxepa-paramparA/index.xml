Here, more than a thousand years ago was born SrI Alavandar on dhAtu samvatsaram, ADi month, when Uttirada Naksharam was on the ascent. He is the grandson of SrI Nathamunigal, the first propagator of SrI ViSishTAdvaita siddhAntam. SrI Nathamunigal went once on a pilgrimage to northern region of India with his father, ISvara Bhattar and his son, ISvaramuni. After taking bath in many sacred rivers, and visits to sacred temples, they arrived at the beautiful temple town of BrundAvanam known for the myriad sports of Lord Krishna. They were enchanted by the beauty of BrundAvanam. They decided to extend their stay by a few more days. Thereafter, they took leave of BhagavAn, the BrundAvanacaran and returned to their home in Veeranarayanapuram. While SrI Nathamunigal was staying at BrundAvanam, he became the object of the special anugraham of Lord Krishna, the Yamunaitturaivan on the banks of Yamuna River. SrI Nathamunigal developed extraordinary bhakti now for Kannan, the Yamunaitturaivan. Because of the deep devotion to the Lord Krishna, Nathamunigal wanted to name the child that will be born to his son ISvaramuni as Yamunaitturaivan. Accordingly when the male child was born he was named as Yamunaitturaivan. As this child grew up to become a renowned AcAryan, he acquired the names of SvAmi Alavandar and YaamunAcAriyar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Udaiyavar named that commentary as &amp;ldquo;Bhagavad Vishayam&amp;rdquo; and ordered that this commentary be included along with the kAlakshepa granthams like Sri BhAshyam. Following his own AcAryan Alavandar&amp;rsquo;s wish and command, EmperumAnAr gave the name of SvAmi NammAzhvAr to PiLLAn. From then on, the name of PiLLAn came to be known as &amp;ldquo;TirukkurukaipirAn PiLLAn&amp;rdquo;.

The sannidhi of Lord dIpaprakASar is here. Near by is the agrahAram of tUppul. It means sacred grass - viSvAmitram (darbham). Learned people state that tUppul agrahAram is named that way because of many scholars born in the ViSvAmitra gotram were living there. There lived one by the name, Ananta SomayAji who was performing yaj~nAs. His son was PuNDarIkAksha dIkshitar whose son was AnantasUri. ApiLLAr gave away his younger sister, totArambA, daughter of SrIrangarajacharyar in marriage to AnantasUri. This dampati&amp;rsquo;s life went on smoothly observing bhagavad bhAgavata ArAdhanam and the daily rites done during the five divisions of the day (pancakAla parAyaNar).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
