SrIrAmamiSrar was born in the kali yugam year around 4052, Virodhikrut year, month of mAsi when the star Magham was in ascendance. He was the incarnation of Kumudar (one of the dvArapAlaka-s at SrI VaikuNTham). He was born in the agrahAram known as Manakkal on the banks of Kaveri River, eastern side of Srirangam in Chola deSam. Going by the birth place of him, he was popularly known as Manakkal Nambi. He was the pradAna Sishya of Uyyakkondar and learnt Veda vedantAs thoroughly by serving his AcAryan. When Uyyakkondar's wife attained paramapadam, Manakkal Nambi took charge of the cooking service too for his AcAryan.

On one occasion, the young girls of the village taking food from homes went to the Kaveri River to take bath in the river, to eat after bath and to have a playful time. SrI Uyyakkondar's two daughters were also eager to join the group of young girls and sought the permission of Sri Uyyakkondar. On his AcAryan's direction, Manakkal Nambi accompanied them and to help them as and when necessary. The two girls after eating were playing with the other young girls on the bank of Kaveri River. When returning back to home, they lost their way and could not cross a canal as they were afraid to cross it. On seeing this, Manakkal Nambi lied down across the canal covering both the sides of the banks. He told the girls to walk on his back and cross the canal. They did so and crossed the canal. Manakkal Nambi accompanied them and left them near the house, telling them that he will go to take bath and come back. Even before Manakkal Nambi came back from his bath, SrI Uyyakkondar learnt about the entire incidence and he was very pleased. When Nambi returned, he paid his obeisance to SrI Uyyakkondar; the AcArya praised him and expressed his immense happiness and blessings. When SrI Manakkal Nambi said, "உற்றேன் உகந்து பணி செய்து உன்பாதம், பெற்றேன், ஈதே யின்னம் [[15]]
வேண்டுவதெந்தாய் (uRREn ukantu paNi Ceytu unpAdam peRREn, IdE yinnam vENDuvatentAy)". By serving your tiruvaDi, I am blessed and I don’t want anything other than that. SrI Uyyakkondar was pleased and happy and blessed him.
