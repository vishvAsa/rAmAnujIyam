In the village of Madhuramangalam, EmpAr was born to Kamalanayana Bhattar and Periya PirATTi, the younger daughter of Periya Tirumalainambi in the year Krodana, thai month when Punarvasu star was in ascendance.

(His vaibhavam is linked closely to the vaibhavam of EmperumAnAr and so no separate description of them is included here).

Final days

After the time of EmperumAnAr, Govinda Bhattar was teaching the esoteric works of Udaiyavar to ParASara Bhattar and others as per the wish of EmperumAnAr. All the time he was living in the memory of EmperumAnAr. One day he meditated on the holy feet of Udaiyavar. As he was not being able to live without Udaiyavar, he prayed to Periya Perumal and wished to attain Paramapadam. He called his pradAna Sishya, ParASara Bhattar and told him, "Oh Bhattar! Do not think that you are the son of AzhvAn, have learnt well all the SAstrAs, you are the adopted son of Namperumal and proud of yourself. Understand and remember that the holy feet of Udaiyavar show the right path. You teach the Ramanuja darSana granthams to all the disciples". Then, he prayed to the holy feet of Udaiyavar and attained Paramapadam. His last rites were conducted through ciRia Govinda Perumal by ParASara Bhattar.
