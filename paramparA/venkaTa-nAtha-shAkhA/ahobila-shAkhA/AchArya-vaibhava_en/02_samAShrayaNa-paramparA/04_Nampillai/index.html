  <meta property="og:description" content="Nampillai was born in the agrahAram of Nambur in the month of Kaartigai when KrutikA nakshtram was in ascendance. He completed kAlakshepam under NamjIyar and was the proponent of the sampradAyam after the time of NamjIyar. He was teaching traditional granthams in Srirangam. PeriyavAcchAn Pillai, VaDakku Tiruveedhi Pillai, PinpAzhagiya Perumal jIyar, EyuNNi Madhava Perumal and several other scholars of eminence were undergoing kAlakshepam under Nampillai.
Question of the King
Nampillai was an acknowledged expert in rendering Bhagavad VishAya kAlakshepam. One day a group of SishyAs were coming out after the conclusion Bhagavad Vishaya kAlakshepam by Nampillai. It was told by many that on seeing the group of the disciples, a king asked, “Is this group of people from the sannidhi of Namperumal or the group of SishyAs of Nampillai?” Thus, Nampiilai had a huge group of SrI VaishNavAs as his disciples.">

  <p>Nampillai was born in the agrahAram of Nambur in the month of Kaartigai when KrutikA nakshtram was in ascendance. He completed kAlakshepam under NamjIyar and was the proponent of the sampradAyam after the time of NamjIyar. He was teaching traditional granthams in Srirangam. PeriyavAcchAn Pillai, VaDakku Tiruveedhi Pillai, PinpAzhagiya Perumal jIyar, EyuNNi Madhava Perumal and several other scholars of eminence were undergoing kAlakshepam under Nampillai.</p>
<p>Question of the King</p>
<p>Nampillai was an acknowledged expert in rendering Bhagavad VishAya kAlakshepam. One day a group of SishyAs were coming out after the conclusion Bhagavad Vishaya kAlakshepam by Nampillai. It was told by many that on seeing the group of the disciples, a king asked, &ldquo;Is this group of people from the sannidhi of Namperumal or the group of SishyAs of Nampillai?&rdquo; Thus, Nampiilai had a huge group of SrI VaishNavAs as his disciples.</p>
<p>The grandson of MudaliyANDAn was KandADaiyANDAn and his son was KandADai Thozhappar who was jealous of Nampillai’s popularity. Once, KandADai Thozhappar was worshipping Perumal when Nampillai arrived there with his huge group of disciples. Thozhappar was annoyed on seeing Nampillai and rebuked him with abusive language in the sannidhi itself. Nampillai on listening to those rebukes was upset and shaken, worshipped Perumal and left the place.</p>
<p>Indifference of Thozhappar&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>Thozhappar&rsquo;s wife came to know of this from the persons who came from the temple. Being a knowledgeable person, she felt very unhappy to hear the details. She could not continue with the household chores as she was in a very depressed state and dejected mood. At that time Thozhappar returned home from the temple. He was concerned to observe that his wife was not her usual self and was seemingly indifferent. He asked her, &ldquo;Till now you have been very affectionate to me, what is the reason now for your indifferent attitude today?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I came to know that today at the Perumal sannidhi, you have rebuked and belittled Nampillai, who is considered as the incarnation of AzhvAr and source of affection and happiness of Periya Perumal. You do not even seem to be having any regret for this BhAgavata apacAram. I feel sad about your behaviour. In case you hate me for [[172]] saying this you may do anything you want of this body which was groomed by my parents and given to you in marriage. My AtmA has been uplifted on the day I performed Prapatti at the lotus feet of my AcAryan. You are well aware that BhagavAn stated &lsquo;padmakoTiSatenApi na kshamAmi kadAcana&rsquo;, yet you disgraced yourself in front of Perumal by your action of committing a sin by rebuking Nampillai which is an audacious and foolish act&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thozhappar, hailing from a reputed vamSam and being a scholar of repute, realised his folly borne out of his jealousy, asked his wife as what he has to do now. His wife replied, &ldquo;A person who has lost something in the river will not be searching for that thing in a pond. If you offer your obeisance to Nampillai who is graciousness personified and seek his forgiveness, he will definitely pardon you. Thozhappar was feeling very guilty and said, &ldquo;Having rebuked him in front of several people at the sannidhi of Perumal, I feel guilty and shameful to go to his house. I am also scared. Please take me to his house and make an earnest appeal&rdquo;. She agreed to do so. At once, she started with her husband to go to the house of Nampillai.</p>
<p>The Humble Nampillai</p>
<p>Nampillai after returning to his home from the temple sent back his disciples. He was fasting throughout the day and was crestfallen. In the evening he completed his daily rituals, covered his head in a cloth and went to the house of KandADai Thozhappar. He lay down in the pyal (tiNNai- raised platform outside of a house for resting). At that time Thozhappar and his wife came out of the house to go to the house of Nampillai. They saw some one lying down on the pyal. Thozhappar asked as to who is lying down here.</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;aDiyEn tirukalikanRi dAsan&rdquo;. Thozhappar was shocked and surprised. He said, &ldquo;Oh! What is this? Are you lying down in front of my house angry and revengeful on me for having verbally abused and rebuked you at the sannidhi of EmperumAn in front of several people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nampillai replied, “SvAmin! You are the descendant of MudaliyANDAn. I have caused troubles to you at the sannidhi of Periya Perumal. For committing such a great sin, do I have any refuge other than your holy abode?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[[173]] Became LokachAryar</p>
<p>When he himself wanted to seek the pardon from Nampillai, the humble words of Nampillai who had come to his door steps made Thozhappar feel very remorseful and he was overcome with emotion and became tearful on seeing such a great attitude of Nampillai. He hugged Nampillai and said, &ldquo;I merely thought of you as an AcAryA of a few disciples. Now I realise that you deserve to be the AcAryA for the entire world&rdquo;. Saying thus he presented the name as &lsquo;LokAchAryAr&rsquo; to Nampillai. He took Nampillai inside his house. He and his wife prostrated at the feet of Nampillai and sought his pardon. He learnt several SAstrArthams from Nampillai and remained as his very devoted disciple.</p>
<p>The charisma of Nampillai</p>
<p>Pinpazhgiya Perumal jIyar was one of the disciples of Nampillai. He used to render service to Nampillai. Once the jIyar fell ill and was bed ridden. He called some of his SrI VaishNava friends and told them, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave for Paramapadam now. Please offer Prapatti and prayers at Azhagiaya Manavalan sannidhi by reciting prabandha pAsurams, &lsquo;ஏழையேதலன் EzhaiyEtalan&rsquo; (Tirumangai AzhvAr, Periya Tirumozhi 5-8) and &lsquo;ஆழியெழச் சங்கும் வில்லுமெழ AzhiyezhA cangum villumezhA&rsquo; (NammAzhvAr – Tiruvaimozhi 7-4) so that I will live in this world for some more time here&rdquo;. The SrI VaishNavas offered their prayers accordingly. Pinpazhagiya Perumal jIyar got cured of his ailment.</p>
<p>A few SrI VaishNavAs told Nampillai, &ldquo;Can Pinpazhagiya Perumal jIyar being a knowledgeable and elderly person, seek such a wish and pray for longevity which is against the premise of the basic nature of a SrI VaishNava?&rdquo; Nampillai said, “I am not aware of his intention but you may ask EngalAzhvAn and others as to what could be his intention&quot;.</p>
<p>EngalAzhvAn said, &ldquo;He is so attached to the Srirangam divya deSam and wanted to unite with the aIsvrayam SrI Rangarajan, he would have made such a prayer&rdquo;. Tirunarayanapurattu araiyar said, &ldquo;May be because of the kainkaryam remaining incomplete here, he would have prayed like this”. ammangi AmmAl said, &ldquo;For those who have listened to the Bhagavad vishaya kAlakshepam in the Nampillai group, would they have interest for the other deSams?&rdquo; On hearing these, ammangi Periya Mudaliyar said, &ldquo;Bhattar said that if he is not able to have darSan of Namperumal with the same TirumukhamaNDalam and [[174]] Kasturi tilakam at Parampadam, he will return back to Srirangam. It may be that the jIyar is not willing to be separated from Namperumal and so would have prayed thus&rdquo;. Nampillai listened to all the views and looked at jIyar and asked him, &ldquo;Are these acceptable to devareer&rsquo;s mind (tirvuLLam)?&rdquo; The jIyar replied to Nampillai, &ldquo;None of these are the reason for my prayer. Devareer (the Lord) after taking bath, wearing your vEshTi and then the uttarIyam (upper cloth) and walk by, the charismatic appearance of devareer will make me feel that I should keep having your darSan and continue to render my service to you here without the desire to go to Paramapadam. I want to live and have this enjoyable experience and render service to you here for some more time&rdquo;. The entire group of disciples were happy to hear the words and the deep devotion of jIyar.</p>
<p>Trouble in the river.</p>
<p>Nampillai went to Tiruvellarai along with his disciples for worshipping NacchiyAr. On the return trip they boarded a boat to cross the Cauvery river. When the boat was midstream, it became dark and started raining heavily combined with heavy winds. The visibility was very poor and they could not see anything ahead or behind. They lost the sense of direction and feared as to when they will reach the shore. The boatman called out and said, &ldquo;If one or two persons who can swim jump out of the boat in to the river, I can navigate the boat to safety. Else all of us including Nampillai will be drowned in the river&rdquo;. There was pin drop silence and none of them responded to this and were unwilling to take the risk. At that time a good lady, got up and told the boatman, &ldquo;Oh boatman! Nampillai is so dear to all of us and he is our life. Please safeguard him and take him ashore&rdquo;. Saying thus she jumped in to the river unmindful of the darkness and danger. Then, the boat safely reached the shore of the river.</p>
<p>On reaching the shore, Nampillai was very sad and said, &ldquo;A good soul has drowned in the river&rdquo;. He was very disturbed. By the grace of BhagavAn that lady also could perch herself in an elevated sand dune area ten feet from where Nampillai reached the shore. Hearing what Nampillai said she called out, &ldquo;SvAmin! Please don&rsquo;t worry. I have safely reached the river bank&rdquo;. Nampillai sent the boatman to bring her to him. She prostrated at the feet of Nampillai. Nampillai asked her as to how she could manage to reach safely? She replied, &ldquo;I don’t know anyone other than you, my AcAryan who could save me. When I was drawn into the flood waters you came as a bushy tuft and saved me&rdquo;. All the disciples were pleasantly surprised and celebrated her by saying, &ldquo;It is said in the SAstrAs that one should sacrifice his body, [[175]] wealth and life in the service of the AcAryan. We have seen some people rendering service to their AcAryan physically and some offering sampAvanA with their money. This lady is the one who was prepared to offer her life to AcAryan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A letter (palm leaf) to VaikuNThanAthan</p>
<p>The home of Nampillai was less spacious. The next house belongs to a lady, a SishyA of Nampillai. One of the SrI VaishNavAs, a Sishya of Nampillai requested that lady saying, &ldquo;The home of AcAryan is very small and less spacious. You can give your house to AcAryan&rdquo;. She replied to this by saying. &ldquo;Will any one get a yard of space in this Koyil? I have no intention of giving my house to anyone till my death&rdquo;. The SrI VaishNava mentioned this to Nampillai. When Nampillai met that lady on another occasion, he explained to her saying, &ldquo;Since you are only one person you can manage with smaller space. The disciples who come to my house for the kAlakshepam find it difficult because of the lack of space. So please give us your house&rdquo;. The lady agreed to give the house but requested that devareer (Nampillai) should bless her with a space in Paramapadam. Nampillai said, &ldquo;VaikuNThanAthan only can give space there. I will make an appeal to him and get you a space in Paramapadam&rdquo;. The lady persisted, &ldquo;SvAmin! I am very innocent and that too a lady. Therefore your mere words of assurance will not suffice. Please give it in writing&rdquo;. Nampillai was pleasantly surprised and wondered, saying, &ldquo;Here is someone who is quite special&rdquo;. He wrote on a palm leaf, thus, &ldquo;On this year, this month, this date, TirukalikanRidAsan has assured in writing a place for this lady in Paramapadam. The Lord of the entire universe and my dear Lord SrI VaikunThanAthan must bless this lady with a place in Paramapadam&rdquo;. Thus writing, he affixed his signature. The lady placed the palm leaf document on her head reverentially and was very happy. She gave her house to Nampillai. The residents of the town noticed as to what transpired and were pleasantly surprised and said, &ldquo;AcAryan has got rights even in ubhaya vibhUti&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Setback of health to Nampillai</p>
<p>When Nampillai was not in good health, one of the SrI VaishNavAs came to see him and asked, &ldquo;Devareer seems to have become lean and weak!&rdquo; Nampillai responded, &ldquo;If one diminishes another one grows&rdquo; meaning when the knowledge, bhakti and unflinching determination in the path of bhakti grows the physical body through the effects of such determination and penance diminish in size and become leaner. [[176]] When another person said, &ldquo;SvAmi seems to be not in good health and looking frail&rdquo;. Nampillai responded thus, &ldquo;Are we (Nampillai) going to any yuddham? We Have strength sufficient enough to have darSan of Perumal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another SrI VaishNava was upset on seeing the failing health of Nampillai. Nampillai pointed out, &ldquo;According to the saying, &lsquo;krtakrtyAH pratIkshante mrtyum priyamivAditim&rsquo;, should we not think of the bodily illness as a feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the direction of EngalAzhvAn, Pillai EngalAzhvAr and ammangi ammal gave a yantram (metallic sheet, usually in copper, embedded with mantram) to Nampillai and insisted to tie it on his body to overcome the illness. Nampillai refused to do so. They said, &ldquo;Only if you yourself do that it will reflect as a deviation of the very nature of your staunch faith and religious norms. Since we are only requesting you to do that it will not be a deviation of your staunch faith and religious norms&rdquo;. Thus they argued. Nampillai was firm and said, &ldquo;You believe in some mantrams to cure me of my illness whereas I am chanting dvayam and believing in that only. I don&rsquo;t want the connection of the lowly mantrams. Whatever is destined will have to happen&rdquo;. Thus saying he refused.</p>
<p>Question of the King</p>
<p>After a few days, by the anugraham of BhagavAn, Nampillai recovered completely and was his usual self rendering discourses. NaDuvil tiruveedhipillai Bhattar, grandson KoorattzhvAn was jealous of the knowledge, intellect, devotion, determination in rituals, the huge group of disciples and the charisma of Nampillai. Once, he went to the King&rsquo;s court. At that time, he told PinpazhAgiya Perumal jIyar, &ldquo;I am going to the king&rsquo;s court. Devareer also accompany me&rdquo;. The jIyar said, &ldquo;Devareer is the descendant of my ParamAcArya and a scholar of eminence. I will accompany you as per your wish&rdquo;. Thus saying the jIyar went along with him. Both of them reached the King&rsquo;s court. The King welcomed NaDuvil tiruveedhipillai Bhattar with reverence. The king was a scholarly person and has gained knowledge on several aspects through interactions with learned scholars. He wanted to test the knowledge of Bhattar. He posed a question. &ldquo;Oh NaDuvil tiruveedhipillai Bhattar! &lsquo;AtmAnam mAnusham manye rAmam daSarAthmajam&rsquo;, SrI Rama thus asserted saying, &lsquo;I consider Myself only as the son of daSaratha Chakravarti&rsquo; without reflecting on His Ultimate Superiority (paratvam), whereas He said &lsquo;gaccha lokAn [[177]] anuttamAn’ and offered moksham to JatAyu. Is this not contradictory? Please explain this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Classic Reply</p>
<p>NaDuvil tiruveedhipillai was perplexed and in a quandary. He could not think of an appropriate answer. Meanwhile, the King was distracted by another task that needed his attention. Observing that the King is attending to something else, Bhattar asked jIyar, &ldquo;What is the stand of Nampillai on this?&rdquo; The jIyar replied, &ldquo;He will say, &lsquo;‘satyena lokAn jayati&rsquo;. The King finished his other task and asked Bhattar, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a response for my question?&rdquo; Bhattar said, &ldquo;You were attending to some other task and so as to whom should I give the response? Please ask leisurely and we will tell you&rdquo;. Bhattar went on to say,</p>
<p>satyena lokAn jayati dInAn dAnena rAghavaH | gurUn SushrUshayA vIraH danushA yuti SAstravAn ||</p>
<p>SrI Raghavan is victorious over all the worlds by His truthfulness (satyam). He offers dAnam to the needy and gets them on His side. He renders service to His AcAryAs and receive their blessings. With His arrows, He is victorious over His enemies. The King was impressed and said, &ldquo;This is a classic reply and very appropriate and relevant”. Thus saying he was very happy. He presented Bhattar with priceless exquisite clothes, ornaments, several thousand gold coins and offered his obeisance to him. Bhattar blessing the king, took leave of him to return to Tiruvarangam.</p>
<p>No more jealousy</p>
<p>Tiruveedhipillai Bhattar told jIyar, &ldquo;Oh jIyar! Devareer may offer myself and all the gifts at the holy feet of Nampillai&rdquo;. The jIyar took him accordingly. When Nampillai saw his ParamAcAryA&rsquo;s grandson approaching him, he got up and paid obeisance and enquired about the well being of Bhattar. Nampillai looked at all the gifts and asked Bhattar, &ldquo;What are all these?&rdquo; Bhattar said, &ldquo;All these gifts are just for one hundred and sixty in million of your divya sUktis. Therefore, please accept these and myself and bless me&rdquo;. Nampillai told Bhattar, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand anything. Devareer is the grandson of my paramAcAryA and so you should not do like this. Overcame by emotion of guilt, Bhattar told Nampillai “SvAmin! I have been jealous of you till now. I was mentioning all your good qualities as defective ones. I was envious of you of the large group of disciples you had. Now I realised [[178]] your greatness and don not have anymore jealousy of you. Please give me refuge and bless me&rdquo;. Thus saying, he prostrated at the feet of Nampillai. Nampillai lifted him up, embraced him and consoled him. Bhattar learnt several important and special commentaries from Nampillai and never left his side.</p>
<p>125,000 (sapAdalaksha) granthams written in palm leaves were thrown to termite</p>
<p>Bhattar was undergoing everyday morning TiruvAimozhi kAlakshepam under Nampillai. In the night, he used to write the learning&rsquo;s in palm leaf. The kAlakshepam concluded. Next day morning Bhattar presented the detailed commentary of TiruvAimozhi with one lakh and twenty five thousands granthams (125,000/sapAdalaksha) similar to Mahabharata at the holy feet of Nampillai.</p>
<p>Nampillai - What is this?</p>
<p>Bhattar - I have compiled the meaning and commentaries of TiruvAimozhi taught by SvAmin and written them.</p>
<p>Nampillai - Are these over one lakh granthams (sapAdalaksham)?</p>
<p>Bhattar - Yes. Please open this and bless me. I have not even added one comma or semicolon or anything to what you have taught and nothing over and above them.</p>
<p>Nampillai replied, &ldquo;It may be so. But this has been done without my approval. Do you know how much of trouble TirukkurugaippirAn would have under gone to get the approval of EmperumAnar for composing tiruvARAyirappaDi? Composing such a huge work should not have been done without our direction/niyamanam&rdquo;. Saying thus, Nampillai without even opening and seeing them, he poured water on the palm leaves and thrown them to termite.</p>
<p>(Palm leaf writings are to be preserved in dry condition. If moisture is there it will attract termite which will destroy the palm leaf and along with that the writings will be lost forever).</p>
<p>Commentary by PeriyavAcchAn Pillai</p>
<p>Then, Nampillai assigned PeriyavAcchAn Pillai, to compose a commentary on TiruvAimozhi. PeriyavAcchAn Pillai, the dearest disciple of Nampillai, learnt and understood from him all the texts and [[179]] the meanings. As per the wish of his AcAryan, PeriyavAcchAn Pillai composed and presented the commentary on TiruvAimozhi containing twenty four thousand granthams (24,000) similar to SrImad Ramayana.</p>
<p>EDu (ஈடு) muppattARAyirpaDi/36,000 paDi</p>
<p>VaDakku Tiruveedhipillai undergoing TiruvAimozhi kAlakshepam under Nampillai, every night he used to write down that day&rsquo;s leaning in palm leaf. When the kAlakshepam was completed, he presented his notes to Nampillai saying, &ldquo;This grantham contains thirty six thousand granthams (36,000) similar to that of SrutaprakASikA&rsquo;s vyAkyAnam for SrI BhAshyam. Please see and bless this&rdquo;. Nampillai went through the entire work and commented thus, &ldquo;This is neither too long nor too short and is very appropriate. However, this is not correct as it has been done without my approval&rdquo;. So saying, Nampillai kept it inside. EyuNNi Madhava Perumal learnt about this and was very upset. He offered prayers at the sannidhi of Namperumal for several days and prayed, &ldquo;The work of VaDakku Tiruveedhipillai should be used in kAlakshepams&rdquo;. Once Nampillai along with his disciples came to the sannidhi of Namperumal and did MangaLASAsanam. He partook the tIrtha prasAdam etc. At that time, Perumal through His arcaka called Nampillai and directed him to teach the EDu muppattARAyirapaDi to EyuNNi Madhava Perumal. As per the divine order, Nampillai taught EDu muppattARAyirapaDi to EyuNNi Madhava Perumal also known as ciriyAzhvAn appillai and blessed him.</p>
<p>Bharata SaraNagati</p>
<p>One day at the kAlakshepa group of Nampillai, one of the disciples raised a question. &ldquo;BharatAzhvAn did his SaraNAgati to Perumal, but it was unsuccessful. Why?&rdquo; Nampillai said. &ldquo;It was successful&rdquo;. He went on to explain thus, &ldquo;Bharatan did his SaraNAgati to Lord Rama fearing that he cannot act freely on his own will (svasvAtantryam) and so not willing to take the rule of the kingdom (rAjya paripAlanam). So Perumal gave him His pAdukAs and advised him to rule the country on behalf of the pAdukAs. Immediately, Bharatan could overcome his apprehension. &ldquo;Aruroha ratham hrshTaH Satrughna-sahito balI&rdquo; - the mighty Bharatan after he received the pAdukAs got in to the chariot happily along with Satrughnan. Is not this stated in SrImad Ramayana Slokams?&rdquo; Bharatan prayed to Perumal to return to Ayodhya. Perumal did not oblige. &ldquo;rishayobyAgaman sarve vatAyAsurarakshasAm&rdquo; - All the Rishis approached Rama and prayed to Him to save them from the Rakshasas (demons). As Rama considered it as His duty to fulfil the [[180]] wishes of the Rishis, he did not return to Ayodhya. When some guests visit our home we provide them all the food that is available at home unmindful of starvation. Likewise, Rama found it extremely difficult to be separated from Bharatan. However, He wanted to fulfil the wishes of the Rishis of the residents of danDakAraNyam and so did not want to go back to Ayodhya&rdquo;. Thus said Nampillai.</p>
<p>Do not desire for wealth</p>
<p>appillai asked Nampillai, &ldquo;Is it wrong to seek wealth from the Lord?&rdquo; Nampillai replied, &ldquo;When wealth is sought from the Lord, three types of blemishes (doshams) will occur&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When we seek what we are not destined to get - The Almighty
Lord grants what one wants. Is there anything that is denied by
Him? Yes, it is there. There are certain things which one is not
supposed to get as what he wants. So when one chooses to seek
such things they are denied due to his destiny, not only it is
denied to him but also whatever wealth he has in his possession
will also be lost. Is not the bhagavat vAkyam say,
&lsquo;yasyAnugraham icchAmi dhanam tasya harAmyaham&rsquo;? We seek
moksham through our AcArya. But when we seek wealth this is
contrary to the moksham sought by us through the AcArya. So
seeking wealth is denied to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wishing for something which is not appropriate for our status
(svarUpam) - It is like a prince wishing to have the porridge
being taken by the son of the hunter. When the greatest benefit
namely the aiSvaryam of Moksham has been assured, longing
for cheaper aspects such as wealth is not appropriate for the
status of a prapannan, is it not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Lord Almighty is so very happy that His long lost
property (the cetanan as prapannan) will be back with Him and
with the act of the prapannan seeking wealth will make Him feel
desolate. Likewise, when the husband is so loving and
affectionate to his wife, what will happen when she desires for
another person? If so, whether the husband himself will bring
the other person to her? In that case, her chastity will be
compromised by such an act and her husband will undergo
severe mental turmoil. Is it not so?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[[181]] Three types of bliss (Sukham)</p>
<p>Once, Nampillai visited the house of tEnkoLcOlai dAsar at Tiruvellarai. He was very glad to notice the wealthy status of dAsar. One by name, YatirAjadAsar asked as to whether amassing wealth is proper. Nampillai replied that the worldly pleasure (samsAra sukham) is of three types. When one thinks that this type of happiness/Sukham (aiSvaryam/wealth) belongs to only himself, then it is like naraka anubhavam. When the same aiSvaryam is considered as his own and of EmperumAn, then it becomes a heavenly bliss (SvargAanubhvam). In the third case, if the same wealth is considered by one as belonging only to EmperumAn, it is eternal bliss. Such happiness is experienced only in Paramapadam.</p>
<p>The twelve types of bhAgavatApacAram</p>
<p>Once when, the kAlakshepam was under way, a discussion took place on bhAgavatApacAram. Nampillai gave a detailed explanation on that subject. There are twelve types of bhAgavatApacAram.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Talking about BhAgavatAs based on birth (janmam)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about his SarIram (physical appearance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pAka (AkAra) nirUpaNam - about the food habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentioning about his ASramam (varNASramams)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about his limbs and parts of the body (avaya)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about his lazyness (Alasya)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about the place of residence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking about the relatives of the BhAgavatA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prakASa nirUpaNam – Speaking about the knowledge and
intellect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prakAra nirUpaNam - Thinking and speaking about his discipline
and habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vartana nirUpaNam -Thinking and speaking about the manner in
which he conducts himself
<a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a> AcArya Vaibhavam
182</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dosha nirUpaNam -Thinking and speaking about the defects</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking about even one of the above is considered as bhAgavatApacAram. This is considered very bad. For example, one should extend courtesies to BhAgavatAs coming from a very small village in the same manner that one will extend courtesies to those coming from Srirangam, Tirumalai, Kanchipuram et al. One should not think that the place where they live is not a divya deSam. One should not even think inferior about the place where the BhAgavatA lives.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting episode from PurANam. Once upon a time, a lady named ChANDili was living in a foreign land (mlecchabhUmi). She was very hospitable to those who pass by her home. Periya tiruvaDi (Garudan) learnt about this lady and visited her place. On seeing Periya tiruvaDi, the lady received him with joy and offered him with various type of food. Garudan was immensely pleased by the hospitality of the lady. Then he lay down at a place to sleep. He was thinking about the hospitality of the lady and was wondering. He thought of her as such a noble person and also very devoted. If she is not in this land (mlecchabhUmi), it would have been better for her. Thus thinking, he slept.</p>
<p>When he woke up, all his feathers have fallen. He could not even get up. He was shocked and wept. On seeing Periya tiruvaDi, the lady was shocked. She asked, &ldquo;How did this happen? Are you unwell or some problem?&rdquo; Garudan told her, &ldquo;There is nothing wrong with my health. Before I went to sleep, I was thinking that &rsquo;this lady is in a foreign land. She should be taken to tiruvarangam&rsquo;. Such a thought has become a great apacAram. This bhAgavatApacAram has caused loss of my feathers. I am not even able to get up. Please pardon my apacAram&rdquo;. Thus he prayed to her.</p>
<p>ChANdilI said, &ldquo;I consider that it is beneficial to live in this place only. I get an opportunity to extend courtesies and receive unexpected guests like Devareer who come by to this place. Is not it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garudan said that he has changed his thought and asked her to pardon him. As soon as he said this, his feathers grew back as it was like before. This incident clearly points to the blemish occurring on account of thinking about the place of stay of the BhAgavatAs. Similar effects occur due to the other apacarAms too.</p>
<p>[[183]] Birth of a son by the blessings of Pillai</p>
<p>Once, Nampillai was getting ready for performing mAdhyAhnikam. At that time VaDakku Tiruveedhi Pillai&rsquo;s mother, ammi ammal prostrated at the feet of Nampillai. He enquired her and asked, &ldquo;Is there any reason for your visit?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Yes, there is a reason. My son is very crazy. You got his marriage performed to one girl. We arranged nuptial on an auspicious date. He shouted loudly from inside of the room. We all went inside to see. We could not understand anything and were confused as he was crying and weeping. When asked the reason for his crying, he said that she is like a hooded snake and so afraid. Saying thus he came out. On another occasion too same thing happened. That bride has to have a good life. Please bless for the lineage to grow&rdquo;. Nampillai said. &ldquo;You bring the girl at an appropriate time after her menstrual cycle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Accordingly, ammi ammal came along with her daughter in law. Nampillai chanted some mantram and sprinkled the sacred water in the face and stomach of the girl and sent her away. He called VaDakku Tiruveedhi Pillai and explained to him the SAstrArtham of the vAkyams, &ldquo;rutaU upeyAt&rdquo; and sent him home. That night VaDakku Tiruveedhi Pillai slept with his wife without any fear. His wife became pregnant. After twelve months, she gave birth to a boy in the month of aippasi when SravaNa nakshatram was in ascendance. The boy was named as &ldquo;LokAchAryapillai&rdquo; since he was born with the blessing of Nampillai. After a few years, another boy baby was born to the couple with the blessings of Namperumal. This child was named as Azhagiya MaNavALapperumAL nAyanAr.</p>
<p>Thus, Nampillai was blessing all and continued with his routine. Once he suffered a setback on his health. His health deteriorated and he became weak. He offered his SrIpAda tIrtham to his disciples. He partook the SrIpAda tIrtham of his AcAryan and ascended to Paramapadam. PeriyavAcchAn Pillai, NaDuvil Tiruveedhipillai Bhattar, VaDakku Tiruveedhipillai, PinpazhAgiya Perumal jIyar and other disciples could not bear the separation from their AcAryA and were extremely sad. They consoled themselves and organised the final rites though tUviyampillai, son of Nampillai. All the religious ceremonies were completed though the son of Nampillai according to the procedures.</p>
