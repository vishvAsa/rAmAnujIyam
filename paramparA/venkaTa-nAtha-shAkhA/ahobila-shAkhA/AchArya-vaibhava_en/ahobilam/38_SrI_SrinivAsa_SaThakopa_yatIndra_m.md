The avatAram of this Azhagiyasingar took place at Thirukkudantai in the year SiddhArti, thai month, dvAdaSI tithi, Friday when ArudrA nakshatram was in ascendance (January 1860). His pUvASrama name was Thirukkudantai ILanagar Gadadharapuram SrIvatsAngam VidvAn SrI u. vE. Chakravarthi Venkatacharya SvAmi. He was an expert in tarka SAstram. He had his VedAnta kAlakshepam with Pillaipakkam Azhagiyasingar and received his blessings. He was very wealthy too. Some of his ancestors who were great scholars have administered the SrI sannidhi AsthAnam. Thus he had the distinction of being a descendant of a noble clan, scholarly person and blessed with abundant wealth.

37th paTTam Pillaipakkam Azhagiyasingar attained Paramapadam suddenly without appointing any successor. There was no one to administer the AsthAnam for five and half years. For a period of five and half years from the year VikAri, Margazhi month to ViSvAvasu year, Adi month, there was no one to adorn the AsthAnam but the tiruvArAdhanam and others were going on properly. Some one was appointed to handle the day to day affairs related to the mundane aspects.

[[328]] During this period, several of the qualified and capable vidvAns wished to ascend the simhAsanam of SrI maTham. Thirukkudantai SvAmi, SrI Mushnam SvAmi, KudavAsal SvAmi, Thirukkallam Agent SvAmi and others were competing to head the AsthAnam. So an election was conducted. SrI sannidhi SishyAs cast their votes. Thirukkudantai SvAmi secured the mandate. He took to ascetic order and ascended the simhAsanam of the SrI sannidhi AsthAnam in the year ViSvAvasu, Adi month, Paurnami tithi, Monday (17th July 1905) when the UttirAda nakshatram was in ascendance. The ASrama sveekAram took place at SrI Nrusimhapuram. This grand function was attended by SrI Sannidhi disciples from all over the country. SvAmi camping at SrI Nrusimhapuram was performing panca samskAram and grantha catushTyam to the disciples. He travelled to Pullambudamkudi, AdanUr, Thirukkudantai, Thiruvinnagar, Therezhundur, ThiruvindaLur, ThirukkUdalUr, ThirukkandiyUr, Thanjai mAmanikkoyil, appakudattAn sannidhi, Thiru anbil, Vaduvur, Thiruppuliyur, Thirukkannapuram et al and performed mangaLASAsanam of the EmperumAns. Later, he stayed permanently at SrI Nrusimhapuram. He used to perform often MangaLASAsanam of the EmperumAn at Pullambudamkudi and AdanUr temples which were under the administration of the SrI Ahobila maTham.

As time went by, Sri Azhagiyasingar’s heath condition deteriorated. After appointing SrI u. vE. Rangacharya SvAmi, an acclaimed scholar in VyakaraNam who lived in the north bank of HaridrAnadi at Mannargudi to administer the AsthAnam, this Azhagiyasingar ascended to Paramapadam in the year Saumya, Chittirai month, KrshnAshTami tithi, Wednesday (12 May 1909). His BrundAvanam is in SrI Nrusimhapuram.

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 3 years, 10 months.

There are two works on this Azhagiyasingar, one named "SrInivAsa SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan gadyam", composed by Karukkuricchi Vangeepura VidvAn SrI kAryam VenkatarAmAchariyar SvAmi and the other one "VaibhavaprakASikA", by Pudukkottal dAnAdhikAri, matatraya nirUpakar VidvAn KALi Vangeepuram SrI RangachAriyar The divya mangala vigraham of this Azhagiyasingar was consecrated by 40th paTTam Azhagiyasingar.
