VidvAn Vangeepuram Rangacharya SvAmi. He ascended the simhAsanam of SrI sannidhi in the year SarvadhAri, Adi month (31st), Monday when SvAti nakshatram was in ascendance (13 August 1888).

[[295]] This Azhagiyasingar was the younger brother of the famous SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan (33rd PaTTam). He was an acknowledged expert in presenting tarkam and VedAntArthams. His discourses on SrI BhAshyam used to be of highest level of clarity. His expertise and competency on SrI BhAshyam kAlakshepam was so great that when he attained paramapadam, SrI SvarNam Krishnamacharyar SvAmi known popularly as Sri Mushnam SvAmi reportedly remarked that "Sri BhAshyam has departed ".

The previous paTTam Kalattur Azhagiyasingar suddenly ascended to Paramapadam without assigning anyone to succeed him. At the request of the disciples at the SrI sannidhi, SrI Azhagiyasingar ascended to the AsthAna simhAsanam.

Some of the disciples from other places were of the opinion that Kuricchi Srirangacharya SvAmi of Chola nADu, a well known scholar, a sattarkavAcaspati (expert in tarka vAdam) should ascend the simhAsanam of SrI sannidhi. They filed an appeal in High Court. The ruling was in favour of SrI Azhagiyasingar. This particular case and its judgement have been recorded in the Law Journal.

This Azhagiyasingar on sancAram reached Paadur agrahAram where many Sri Sannidhi VaishNAvAs were living. He fell ill there. He ascended to Paramapadam in the year ViLambi, Margazhi month (14th), Tuesday, Paurnami tithi when Mrugaseersha nakshatram was in ascendance (27th December, 1898).

His BrundAvanam is situated in the western prakAram of Paadur temple. The vigraha pratishThA was done there by the 40th paTTam Azhagiyasingar. The people of the village say that the prayers made at the BrundAvanam of this Azhagiyasingar get fulfilled.
