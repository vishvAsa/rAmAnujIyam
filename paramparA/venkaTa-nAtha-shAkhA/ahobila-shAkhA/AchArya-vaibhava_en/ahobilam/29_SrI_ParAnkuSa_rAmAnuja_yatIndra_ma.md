This Azhagiyasingar was born in Lalapettai agrahAram. He belonged to Vajram vamSam. He was born in the month of Chittirai, Chitra nakshartram. He ascended to the AsthAnam of SrI maTham on durmukhi year, Kartikai month, Sukla paksha Navami tithi (17 Nov. 1836).

This Azhagiyasingar was an expert in all the SAstrAs (sAmAnya and ViSesha SAstrAs). He was very much detached from aiSvaryam of any kind (virakata). After completing his MangaLASAsanam of Kodandaraman and Janakavalli tAyAr at Madurantakam, he went to Perumal koyil to worship PeraruLALan and Perumdevi tAyAr. He visited other divya deSams in and around Kanchipuram and also SvAmi DeSikan's sannidhi. He then went to the divya deSam of Tirupputkuzhi. There he took his bath in the Jatayu PushkaraNi. After completing his daily rituals, he performed his MangaLASAsanam of the Lord, Vijayaraghavan and Maragathavalli tAyAr.

From there, the jIyar went Tirupparkkadal on the banks of the River Palar. This kshetram is celebrated by the PurANams. The AcAryan was not feeling well and decided to stay at Tirupparkkadal, a quiet place ideal for the Yatis' way of life. He decided to reside for the rest of his life at Tirupparkkadal. He remembered his AcAryan's command and [[269]] got in touch with relative from his pUrvASramam, Ilanagar GadAdharapuram SrI Chakravartpyacharya SvAmi, a great Scholar, leader in anushThAnam and VairAgyam. He requested Ilanagar SvAmi to accept the position of the responsibilities of being his successor as per the command of his own AcAryan, Tirukkurunkudi Azhagiyasingar. Ilanagar SvAmi accepted this request as the command of BhagavAn Himself and accepted the request to succeed this 29th paTTam Azhagiyasingar. Chakravartiyacharya SvAmi accepted the sanyAsASramam. On that same day, he had paTTAbhishekam as the next (30th paTTam) Azhagiyasingar and received the Hamsa mudrA, (linked to the position of a yati of Ahobila maTham). He was given of the ASrama tirunAmam of Srinivasa Vedanta MahAdeSikan. He started his sancAram on the same day with Malolan. SrI ParAnkuSa Ramanuja yatIndra MahAdeSikan stayed at Tirupparkkadal enjoying the serenity and solitude of the sthalam fit for the life of a yati.

This Azhagiyasingar has blessed us with SrIlakshmInrusimha SuprabhAtam. At Tirupparkkadal, AcAryan's health worsened further. He ascended to Paramapadam on Hevilambi year, Marghazhi month, Sukla Krishna Caturti tithI, Saturday (16 December, 1837).
