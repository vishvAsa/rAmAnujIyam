King of Mysore performing ArAdhanam

SrI Krishnaraja Kanteerava sArvabhauman was the king of Mysore at that time. He heard about SrImad Azhagiyasingar camping at Thirunarayanapuram. The king sent his ministers and the principals to Thirunarayanapuram to deliver his prayerful request to SrImad Azhagiyasingar to visit Mysore and bless him. The jIyar accepted the king's invitation. The king met the jIyar with pUrNakumbham at the [[261]] city boundary and welcomed him with great reverence. Malolan shared the Kannan sannidhi in the palace. Golden swing and Silver MaNTapam were presented to Malolan. For daily ArAdhanam, the king presented a Vajra (adamantine) vessel and many AbharaNams. He had Malolan and SrImad Azhagiyasingar at his palace and performed ArAdhanams. He gave as gift many villages. He became the deep bhakta of SrImad Azhagiyasingar. The jIyar showered his anugrahams on the King. The jIyar then commenced his sancAram.

From Mysore, the jIyar traveled to Ahobilam for the MangaLASASanam of the nava Narasimhars and thereafter continued his sancAram to Thiruvenkadam, Tiruvallur, Thirukkacchi, Thirukkovalur, Thiruvaheendrapuram and other divya deSams. He arrived at Thirukkudantai. Here, he worshipped ArAvamudan and performed many kaimkaryams. From Thirukkudantai, he left for Srivilliputthur via Srirangam. At Srivilliputthur, he performed MangaLASAsanam of Andal and SrI Rangamannar. He stayed here for a few days. In the sannidhi street a maTham was built by SrImad Azhagiyasingar. A few kaimkaryams were performed at Andal sannidhi by the jIyar. This Azhagiyasingar had the full blessings of Andal. He was celebrated by all. After leaving Srivilliputthur, the jIyar arrived at pANDya nADu nava (nine) tirupattis (divya deSams) and completed his worship and returned to Srinrusimhapuram.

Here, he completed the construction of the BrundAvanam for 25th paTTam SrI Srinivasa yatIndra mahaDesikan and consecrated a vigraham of the 25th paTTam Azhagiyasingar in the BrundAvanam. There he established the Vaidika agrahAram and named it as Sri Ranganathapuram.
