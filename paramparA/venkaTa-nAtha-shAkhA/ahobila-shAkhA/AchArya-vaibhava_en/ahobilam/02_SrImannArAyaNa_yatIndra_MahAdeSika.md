From here on, we will be covering the caritrams of SrImad Azhagiyasingars of Ahobila maTham who reigned from the throne (AsthAnam) of SrI maTham after SrImad Adi VaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan. Lord Narasimhan has the name of Azhagiyasingar. Therefore, the AcAryas who perform daily ArAdhanam for Him are also called Azhgiyasingars from ancient times. We will address these AcAryAS as "Azhagiyasingars" from now on.

We could not obtain the time and year of birth, date, and the names of the parents from their pUrvASramams of many Azhagiyasingars. We could not gather their vaibhavam from the days before they entered the sanyAsa ASramam. Hence, we had to rely on the material assembled in the Guru ParamparA source.

This second paTTam Azhagiyasingar was born in AvaNi month, when jyeshTha nakshatram was in ascendance. The pUrvASrama name was Tirumalai NampAkkam Krishnamacharyar SvAmi. He ascended the throne of SrI Ahobila maTham on a Sukla Pancami day. The year was BahudhAnya and the month was Chittirai (April 1458). The uttama ASrama (sanyAsASrama) name was SrI vaN SaThakopa SrIman Narayana yatIndra mahAdeSikan. He traveled from Tirunarayanapuram to SrI Ahobila divya deSam. From there, he went to many divya deSam up to Sriranagam. He performed MangaLASAsanam to those divya deSa EmperumAns during his sancAram.

The Guru ParamparA states that on the command of the Lord, Tirunarayanan, he consecrated (pratishTha) the divya mangaLa (auspicious) vigraham of the first jIyar, SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan at the Lord's sannidhi and as well at his BrundAvanam (final resting place) of the first jIyar.

Following this tradition, Ahobila maTham in the divya deSams have the pratishTha (consecration) of Adi vaN SaThakopa jIyar.

On the direction of his AcAryan, SrImad Adi vaN saThakopa yatIndra mahAdesikan, this second paTTam Azhagiyasingar in his purvASramam created sixty granthams. Today, we do not even have the names of these granthams. He blessed us with tiruvArAdhana kramam, commentary on nyAsa daSakam, sandhyAvandana bhAshyam etc. These three granthams are in Sanskrit. (42nd paTTam jIyar, InjimeTTu Srmad Azhagiyasingar, provided brief meanings of [[221]] sandhyAvandana bhAshyam in Tamil. This book is no longer available to us).

He has also blessed us with a grantham named "PurushakAra mImAmsA and it is of two parts, pUrva paksham (prima facie case) and siddhAntham. A few scholars acquired these two books and hid the siddhAnta grantham. After some time, Periya VedAnta Ramanuja SvAmi, studied this siddhAnta grantham from his AcAryan through the kAlakshepam route. Learning from this grantham, he created the tattva siddhAnjanam and other granthams. This information is known from Guru ParamparA.

This Azhagiyasingar established the Vaidika agrahAram, "Madhuramangalam".

During this Azhagiyasingar's travel (sancAram) to the divya deSams, Tirunarayanan of Melkote appeared in the Yati's dream and asked the Yati to return to Tirunarayanapuram. Azhagiyasingar returned to Melkote and settled down at his maTham and was conducting kAlakshepams for his SishyAs.

On Nandana year, Krishna Paksha dvitIyai tithi (March 1473), this second jIyar ascended to Paramapadam. His BrundAvanam is on the banks of KalyANi PushkaraNi at Tirunarayanapuram.

His ASthAna nirvAka kAlam lasted for 14 years, 11 months
