This Azhagiyasingar was born in the agrahAram named KaraLapAkkam near Thiruvallur. He belonged to BhAradvAja gotram. He was born in the month of thai, Poorattadi nakshatram. His pUrvASrama tirunAmam was VidvAn Vangeepuram Venkatacharya SvAmi.

He ascended the throne of SrI Ahobila maTham on KALayukti samvatsaram, thai month, Krishna paksha dasami tithi (January 1499). [[225]] This Azhagiyasingar was the most renowned one after SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa jIyar. He was celebrated for his j~nAnam, anushThAnam etc. He was the foremost among those with total detachment from material pleasures. At his sacred feet, many AcArya Purushas sought refuge and thrived. He blessed them with the performance of samASrayaNam, bharanyAsam and kAlakshepams in SrI BhAshyam and other sacred texts. Even today, SrI VaishNavAs belonging to DeSika sampradAyam recite his taniyan.

The nephew of this SrI Azhagiyasingar from his pUrvASramam, Pancamatabhanjanam TatAchAryar SvAmi was brought to SrI Azhagiyasingar by his father and appealed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to bless his nephew, by accepting him as his Sishya. The nephew joined his father and prayed to be accepted.

Guru ParamparA states that SrImad Azhagiyasingar blessed his nephew with samASrayaNa bharanyAsam and also taught him many granthams like SrI BhAshyam through the kAlakshepam route. SrImad Azhagiyasingar blessed his nephew, his pradAna Sishya with the position of serving as SrI kAryam, the principal administrator of the SrI maTham as well as the top scholar in charge of Vaidika activities. Tatacharyar accepted the high position gratefully and executed all the responsibilities of this high office with distinction.

SrImad Azhagiyasingar traveled to Srirangam, Tiruppati, Ahobilam and other divya deSams and performed MangaLASAsanam to EmperumAns of these divya deSams.

At this time, one of the kings of Vijayanagara empire, SadAsivarAyan was busy doing consecration for a number of temples at Kamalapuram, a city near Kadapa (Cudappah) The King invited SrImad Azhagiyasingar to perform the consecration utsavam at these temples. SrImad Azhagiyasingar accepted the king's invitation and conducted the vaidika rites very well. The king was very pleased and expressed his gratitude by presenting a village named SrI BhAshyapuram on the banks of PinAkini River for conducting the worship of SrI Narasimhan. This royal gift is recorded in the documents related to the temple. SrImad Azhagiyasingar stayed at Sri BhAshyapuram for ten years, performing ArAdhanam for Malolan and rendering kAlakshepams to his disciples.

During this time, the daughter of King SadAsivarAyan was possessed by evil spirit (brahmarakshas), The king invited many skilled magicians strained to exorcise these evil spirits. They tried but were not [[226]] successful. The Brahmarakshas laughed at the experts and said that it would not depart through the power of their mantras. It said that he will leave the body of the princess only if SrIshashTa ParankuSa SvAmi orders it to leave.

The king heard about this and went to SrI BhAshyapuram where Sri Azhagiyasingar was and prostrated before him, told his problem and begged for protection from the evil spirit. The compassionate jIyar agreed to come to his city. The king escorted SrI Azhagiyasingar in a palanquin to the palace. There at the palace, the jIyar took a small quantity of water from his vessel, empowered it with SrI NrusimhAnushTup mantram and gave it to the king. SrImad Azhagiyasingar asked the king to give the water to his daughter and to drink the same. The king accordingly asked his daughter. The moment the princess drank the consecrated water, the evil spirit ran away and stated that the curse that it suffered was destroyed by the glory of the tIrtham from SrImad Azhagiyasingar. The brahmarakshas prostrated before the jIyar and performed pradakshiNam and went away.

The king, who witnessed the superhuman power of the jIyar was ecstatic. The jIyar ordered his dear Sishya as well SrI kAryam, Pancamatabhanjanam Tatacharyar to bless the king with samASrayaNa anugraham. The intensely grateful king presented much wealth for Malola ArAdhanam and deeded many villages for the ArAdhanam of Malolan.

After blessing the King, SrImad Azhagiyasingar left on sancAram to divya deSams in the northern region of India. He went up to BadrikASramam and on the return trip, traveled to Tiruppati and other divya deSams in the South. During the sancAram in the South, he established vaidika agrahArams at Neeralur, Kalattur, Purisai, Injimedu and Thaiyar.

At the conclusion of his sancAram, SrImad Azhagiyasingar traveled to Ahobilam and was blessing the SishyAs with kAlakshepams. During one night at Ahobilam, SrI JwAlA Narasimhan appeared in the jIyar's dream and commanded him to perform ArAdhanam for Him permanently and to stay in the same cave, where the Lord had His own sannidhi. SrI Azhagiyasingar carried out the niyamanam of the Lord and initiated his dear and talented disciple, IlankAdu KavitA sArvabhauma SikhAmaNi SvAmi, in to sanyASramam. He asked him to conduct the daily ArAdhanam for Malolan. The jIyar performed a grand special ArAdhanam for the Lord. It was in AngIrasa year, Masi month (February 1513), Krishna paksha pancami tithi, SrImad Azhagiyasingar [[227]] entered the cave, where the Lord resided. It is said that the jIyar even now is residing in the cave and performing ArAdhanam for the Lord.

SrImad Azhagiyasingar's AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 14 years, 1 month

A few days passed after SrI Azhagiyasingar entered in to the cave. SrI Pancamatabhanjanam TatAcharyar SvAmi went near the entrance of the cave and he could not bear the separation from his AcAryan. He wept and cried intensely. SrImad Azhagiyasingar came out of the cave, consoled him and then reentered the cave.
