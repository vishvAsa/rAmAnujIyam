This Azhagiyasingar was born in Sokattur agrahAram in Kanchipuram region in Margazhi month, when MrugasIrsha nakshatram was in ascendance. He ascended the throne of Ahobila maTham during the Bhava Varsham, Purattasi month (October 1694), KrshNa paksha dasami tithi.

After getting the permission of Perumal Koyil PeraruLALan, he started his sancAram for the divya deSams in the South. He performed MangaLASasanams of SrI Devanathan and SrI HayagrIvan at Tiruvaheendrapuram. At this time, a MahA VidvAn, Sri Devarajacharyar SvAmi from Tirunarayanapuram, sought the refuge of the sacred feet of this Azhagiyasingar. He completed kAlakshepams of [[239]] SrI BhAshyam and other traditional granthams and performed his SaraNAgati. He further wanted to enter in to sanyAsASramam. SrImad Azhagiyasingar performed the upadeSam of presha mantram, gave kAshAya vastram (kAvi vastrams/ochre robes) and the tridaNDam to him. He was given the ASrama tirunAmam of "KeSava SaThakopa jIyar" by SrImad Azhagiyasingar. Then, Azhagiyasingar commanded his Sishya to create a new commentary for tiruvAimozhi because of his fluency and scholarship in Tamil.

SrI KeSava SaThakopa jIyar fulfilled the command of his AcAryan and created a new grantham with "patineNNAyirappaDi" (18,000 paDis). He presented the grantham to his AcAryan, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan who was very pleased. As per the niyamanam of SrI Azhagiyasingar, SrI KeSava SaThakopa jIyar was propagating various VaishNava darSana granthams to AstikAs.

SrImad Azhagiyasingar continued with his sancAram to Tirukkovalur, Srimushnam, Tiruchitthirakoodam, TirukkAzhiccheerama ViNNagaram (Seerkazhi), Tiruindalur, Therazhundur, Tirukkudantai and other divya deSams. He stayed at Tirukkudantai. During that time, Vidvad SiromaNi, ArasANippAlai KiDAmbi SrI Venkatacharyar SvAmi who authored VisvaguNAdarSam and other granthams sought the sacred feet of this Azhagiyasingar and performed traditional grantha kAlakshepams under him.
