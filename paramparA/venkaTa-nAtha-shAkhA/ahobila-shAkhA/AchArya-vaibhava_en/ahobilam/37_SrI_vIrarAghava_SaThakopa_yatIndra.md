avatAram

This Azhagiyasingar’s avatAram took place at Pillaipakkam agrahAram near Sriperumbudur. He was born in the year Krodhi, month of Masi (March 1845) when the Pushya nakshatram was in ascendance. He belonged to Kausika gotram in the KomAndUr Ilayavalli vamSam. His father's tirunAmam was SrI Veeraraghavacharya SvAmi. This Azhagiyasingar as an expert in Veda VedAntam strictly adhered to performing all the good deeds and anushThAnam (rituals). His mother's name was Kanakavalli, daughter of iLanagar Tirumalai kaTTam Srinivasatatacharya SvAmi, a paramaikAnti (one who is devoted only to Perumal and who does not need anything from Him except doing kaimkaryam to the Lord) with unblemished attributes. This Azhagiyasingar's pUrvASrama tirunAmam was SaptatantravAcaspati VidvAn Gopalacharya SvAmi. He had two brothers and five sisters. He had the upanayana samskArams at the appropriate age and was studying VedAdhyayanam, kAvyam, nATakam etc., from his father. Every day he along with his brothers used to take bath in the village tank, veppangkANi, completing his daily rituals, walk back to his home reciting brahmayaj~na praSnam. The elders of the village seeing them used to say that they are fortunate to see them which are like seeing vAmana, trivikrama avatArams of the Lord together at one place.

PancasamskAram

He had his pancasamskAram performed by the 33rd PaTTam Azhagiyasingar, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan. After completing VedAdhyayanam, learning of kAvyam, nATakam etc., he [[297]] got married to a gem of a lady named KomalambA. He was performing aupAsanam and pancamahA yaj~nams daily per SAstras and was living in Perumal Koyil (Kanchipuram).

Learning of sAmAnya SAstrAm

This SvAmi (SrI Gopalacharya SvAmi herein referred to as our SvAmi) learnt thoroughly the mahAbhAshyAntam, vyAkaraNa SAstra, and nyAya SAstra from MahAmahopAdhyAya SrI KrishnatAtArya SvAmi of Tirupputkuzhi of great reputation and an expert in sAmanya, ViSesha SAstrAs and other granthams. At that time, an advaiti approached Tirupputkuzhi SvAmi to seek clarification on the word "AdeSa" in sadvidya vAkyam "स्तब्धोम्युत Aतमादेशमप्राक्ष्य stabdhomyuta tamAdeSamaprAkshya". This being a vyakaraNa (grammar) related query, Tirupputkuzhi SvAmi deputed our SvAmi to debate with the advaiti. Our SvAmi presented a very appropriate definition which made the advaiti very happy. SvAmi composed two granthams 'AdeSamaNi’ and 'AdeSakaustubham'. He showed them to Tirupputkuzhi SvAmi. He went through them and was very appreciative of the details and blessed the SvAmi, saying that he is like the light in the lamp. After completing his studies on basic SAstras, SvAmi returned to PillaipAkkam. Staying there, he was doing pravacanam on vyAkaraNa SAstras to his brothers and others.

VedAnta kAlakshepam

Even though SvAmi is a great scholar and expert in all the basic SAstras, he felt that "tat j~nAnam aj~nAnam" (such a knowledge is not the real knowledge) and "cumaiyAna aRu mUnRu kalvikaL cUzha vantAlum ivai tokaiyE" (even if one learns the eighteen vidyA sthAnam-s they will only be a burden; only the Rahasya trayam – ashTAksharam, dvayam and carama Slokam- is the one which will lead to atma ujjivanam/sustenance - pAsuram 9, adhikAra sangraham by SvAmi DeSikan). Feeling thus, he proceeded to SrI sannidhi for doing VedAnta kAlakshepam. He was rendering SrI BhAshya grantha kAlakshepam with his samASrayaNa AcAryan, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan (33rd paTTam). At the request of his SishyAs to bless them, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan started on his sancAram. Our SvAmi not being able to join SrImad Azhagiyasingar (33rd paTTam) returned to his village. As such the SrI BhAshya kAlakshepam could not be completed. After a few days, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan attained paramapadam. The next paTTam 34th Azhagiyasingar, SrI SaThakopa Ramanuja yatIndra mahAdeSikan [[298]] ascended to the AsthAnam. He was staying in Thiruvallur itself. SvAmi went there and completed the incomplete portion of SrI BhAshyam, Gita BhAshyam, SrImad RahasyatrayasAram and Bhagavad vishaya kAlakshepams. Thus, he could complete the grantha catushTyam under AttipaTTu Azhagiyasingar (34th paTTam).

SrI kArya Kaimkaryam

At that time, AttipaTTu Azhagiyasingar assigned him to take up the SrI kArya kaimkaryam of SrI sannidhi. SrI SvAmi accepted the responsibility with zeal on his head like BharatAzhvAn to take up the role with full of devotion and to render service. After a while, SrI Azhagiyasingar directed him to make a golden palanquin for the Lord, SrI Veeraraghavan. Our SvAmi with single minded devotion got this kaimkaryam done very quickly. He also got installed in front of Perumal, the image of Sri Azhagiyasingar with anjali hastam (folded hands). When SrI Azhagiyasingar saw the palanquin, he noticed his image and was immensely pleased. He appreciated the thoughtfulness of our SvAmi similar to how SrI Chakravarti tirumagan appreciated iLayaperumal as "bhAvaj~nena". SrI SvAmi has mentioned this incident as "yenaivAsau yatIndra" in the tenth Slokam of AcArya saptati composed by him on AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar.

nyAsavidyAnushThAnam

He prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to initiate nyAsavidyAnushThAnam (SaraNAgati) to him in the year Vishu, month of Masi on his PushyA tirunakshatram day. SrI Azhagiyasingar accepted the request and assured to perform the SaraNAgati on that day. SrI SvAmi arranged special food (taligai) for SrI LakshmInrusimhan for that day. He was eagerly waiting with deep prayers for the initiation of SaraNAgati. SrI Azhagiyasingar with the intention of making all the others to realise the virtue of patience in our SvAmi, deferred the initiation of BharanyAsam by telling SvAmi at the last minute, "Perumal has not approved for today, so we will do it at a later date". On hearing this, our SvAmi was so graceful without any reflection of disappointment and said, “Your wish is my command. I will take your decision with my head bowed".

Then during the year CitrabhAnu, month of AvaNi when our SvAmi was fast asleep, his AcAryan, AttippaTTu Sri Azhagiyasingar appeared in his dream seated in the simhAsanam after having performed Mangala hAratti to Perumal. He told our SvAmi that he is going to VaikuNTham. On hearing this, our Svami asked Sri Azhagiyasingar as to what will be [[299]] his state now and was deeply disturbed. SrI Azhagiayasingar told our SvAmi that he will initiate SaraNAgati now itself and asked SvAmi to take bath in the HrttApanASini Saras (temple tank at Thiruvallur), change to a new yaj~nopavItam and to come. SvAmi woke up from the dream when he was about to take bath in the HrtatApanASani Saras and realised that what he heard and saw was a dream. He concluded that the appeal he made during the year Vishu has been answered by Sri Lakshminrusimhan in the form of Sri Azhagiyasingar proclaiming thus.

As usual, he woke up at dawn, took bath in the HrttApanASini Saras, and after completing his morning rituals preceded to the sannidhi of SrI Azhagiyasingar and prostrated at his feet. He narrated to Sri Azhagiyasingar, the dream he had. On hearing this, he was very happy and performed nyAsavidyokti nishThA on the same day when the star Revati was in ascendance and blessed our Svami. Those who were present there in the SrI sannidhi appealed to SrI Azhagiyasingar, saying "SrI LakshmInrusimhan Himself appearing in the guise as AcAryan in the dream of this Svami, a bhAgavatottamar like Prahladan, blessed him to prove the saying of Maharishi "sAkshAt nArAyANo devaH krtvA martyamayIm tanUm" and were very happy. This incident was in detail in the grantham, "AcArya saptati" from Slokams 17 to 22.

Bhagavat BhAgavata anugraham

Several times AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar mentioned in the kAlakshepa group that this SvAmi has been blessed with some significance (viSesham). Our SvAmi assigned some of the disciples to compose a taniyan to highlight the special blessing of his AcArya on him. They composed the taniyan, "astyatraiko viSeshaH". Once, SrI Azhagiyasingar happily blessed our Svami telling, "Since you are a scholarly person you could compose all these subjects skilfully in just a while". Taking cue from this, the disciples amended the taniyan as "astyatraiko viSesho budha iti".

SrI SvAmi with the divine grace of Sri Lakshminrusimhan and of the AcAryan living like a mukta (liberated soul) was executing his duties as SrI kAryam without any blemish.

In the year CitrabhAnu, month of Purattasi, AttpipaTTu Azhagiyasingar had a setback on his health. His health further deteriorated and he attained paramapadam. Then Kalattur SvAmi ascended to the Sri Lakshminrusimha AsthAnam. He assigned Pillaipakkam SvAmi himself [[300]] to continue as the SrI kAryam. With the combination of the audAryam (noble attribute) of Kalattur Azhagiyasingar and the AcArya bhakti of our SvAmi as SrIkAryam, the final rites/kaimkaryam to AttipaTTu Azhagiyasingar went off well in a grand manner.

Anugraham of SrI Veeraraghavan

SrI SvAmi always with SrI Azhagiyasingar was administering the duties related to SrI sannidhi very well. At that time, the Lord, SrI Veeraraghavan had some pain in His right hand. SrI Azhagiyasingar was not aware of this. When it was like this, SrI Veeraraghavan appearing in the dream of SrI SvAmi enacted a scene wherein He tried to get up with the support of His right hand and could not do so. He looked at SvAmi, breathing heavily and in a louder voice saying, “Can We (The Lord) suffer from this ailment? Can't you cure this problem through a good Doctor?” In that dream state, SvAmi rushed to the sannidhi of SrI Azhagiyasingar and conveyed this. Next day after waking up, SvAmi narrated the dream to SrI Azhagiyasingar who asked SrI SvAmi to take up the kaimkaryam at once. Sri SvAmi himself identified an expert sthapati (craftsman) and called him. The right tirukkai (hand) of the Perumal which was stretched out on the head of Salihotra Maharishi was set right by the sthapati. Later mahA samprokshaNam was conducted. SvAmi himself has mentioned this incident in the grantham composed by him on his own vaibhavam in Slokams 15, 16, and 17. (This is in SrI sannidhi GuruparamaparA on SrI Veeraraghava SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSika Vaibhavam printed in the year 1914. These Slokams are:

When SrI SvAmi was in Thiruvallur to take up the ascetic order, he prayed to SrI Veeraraghavan and sought His approval. When the Lord, KingehanAthan remained silent in his arcA samAdi, SrI SvAmi prayed EmperumAn who is very fond towards His devotees. The above are the Slokams composed by SrI SvAmi at that time. The meanings of these Slokams are -

Oh Lord KingehanAthA! aDiyEn is roaming around Your Lotus Feet, wanting to drink the nectar from them. But You are not blessing me with Your paripUrNa krupA by saying, "I will bless you". Earlier when there was an ailment in Your tirukkai (hand) it was set right through this dAsan. Have You forgotten that?

Once You appeared in my dream, You attempting to get up with the support of your Hand but could not do so and breathing heavily asked me loudly through Your devotees to bring an expert craftsman to set right the hand and like this You wanted me also to say so loudly.

aDiyEn being your dAsan (servant) rushed to the sadas of SrI Azhagiyasingar, with sadness and shouted saying. "SrI Veeraraghavan is suffering from pain in His hand. Therefore, we need to call a Silpi at once". SrI Azhagiyasingar (Kalattur) who was executing Your sannidhi administration immediately called an expert craftsman to set right the ailment with me as a witness. Oh Graceful One! Can you think of that?"

sthemadarpaNam

Then in the year Paarthiva, kArtikai month, SrI SvAmi sent a pattirikai (letter) to Mannargudi Brahmasri Raju Sastrigal through Kodavasal SrI Ramabhadrachariyar seeking some explanation on the word "sthema" in the Mangala Slokam of SrI BhAshyam. In response to certain objections raised by Mannargudi Brahmasri Raju Sastrigal to SrI BhAshyakArar's use of the word "sthema", our SvAmi authored two esoteric works on Sanskrit Grammar named viz., "sthmedarpaNam" and "vAdatarangiNi" which conclusively rejected the stand taken by Raju Sastrigal and at the same time asserted the usage of the word "sthema".

Living at Sriperumbudur

After Kalattur SrI Azhagiyasingar ascended to paramapadam, the SishyAs of the SrI sannidhi requested SrI SvAmi to accept [[303]] sanyASramam and ascend the simhAsanam of the AsthAnam. SrI SvAmi told them, "I have to perform the last rites of my mother. This kaimkaryam is an important duty to me. Therefore, you may seek some other SvAmi to ascend the SrI sannidhi AsthAnam".

Then he returned back to PillaipAkkam. From there, he used to go to Sriperumbudur daily to offer MangaLASAsanam of SrI BhAshyakArar. SrI BhAshyakArar could not bear to see the troubles being undergone by his devotee. He conveyed to SrI SvAmi to purchase a house on the southern bank of the temple tank so that SrI SvAmi could have the darSan of the VimAnam of Sri BhAshyakArar sannidhi daily. SrI SvAmi entrusted the family affairs to his younger brother and was staying permanently in Sriperumbudur. He composed a stotram, "YatirAja bhogam" and was reciting the same daily. Some of the residents SrI VaishNavAs belonging to the tenAcArya sampradAyam attracted by the virtues and knowledge of SrI SvAmi, learnt SaptentuSekharam, mahAbhAshyam and several other vyAkaraNa granthams. Tirumangalam SrI Narasimhachariyar SvAmi came to Sriperumbudur to learn mahAbhAshyAntam vyAkaraNa SAstras under SrI SvAmi.

divyaprabandha adhyayanam

While, Sri SvAmi was performing upadeSam on the sAmAnya SAstras and SrI BhAshyam and other granthams to those who approached him to learn them, he wished to learn tiruvaimozhi from a learned AcArya. For this purpose, he went to the agrahAram namely, KaayAr. Here a paramaikAnti, SrI SaThakopachariyar was doing uncavrtti and performing bhagavad ArAdhanam. Here, in the year SarvadhAri, Purattasi month when jyesTha nakshatram was in ascendance, SrI SvAmi started learning from him, "KaNNinuN ciRuttAmpu". Then, he started the learning (adhyayanam) of TiruvAimozhi, irAmanuca nURRandAti and other divya prabandhams.

divyadeSa yAtrA

As SrI SvAmi was reciting TruvAimozhi daily, he wanted to worship and have darSan of AzhvAr who composed it. He started his yAtrA of the divya deSams in the southern part, in the year Vikruti, Purattasi month. He arrived at Thiruvaheendrapuram and participated in the SrI DeSika utsavam and then went to other divya deSams. In each of the divya deSam, SrI SvAmi staying for at least for three days was performing MangaLASAsanam of the EmperumAns in these deSams. SrI SvAmi reaching Srirangam in that year, month of Margazhi participated in the irApattu and pakalpattu utsavam and thai [[304]] brahmotsavam. He stayed at Srirangam for two months doing MangaLASAsanam of SrI Ranganathan.

From Srirangam, SrI SvAmi went to Azhwar Tirunagari. There, he recited TiruvAimozhi on the occasion of the Masi brahmotsavam. Staying there for twenty days, he was reciting one thousand times, "kaNNinUN cirRuttAmpu" divya prabandha pAsurams composed by Madhurakavikal. From there, he went to nava Tiruppati divya deSams, Tirumeyyam, Tirukottiyur, Tirppullani, Vanamamalai and Tirukkurunkudi divya deSams. At Tirukkurunkudi, SrI SvAmi performed his MangaLASAsanam of the Lord. Tirukkurunkudi Nambi. He worshipped SrI BhAshyakArar whose sannidhi is on the river bank and was very happy. There, he performed the Meena sangramaNa tarpanNam. Enchanted by the beauty of the place and availability of abundant water resources, SrI SvAmi decided to stay there for some more days.

At that time, SrI SvAmi received a telegram informing him that his mother is not well. On seeing the telegram, he was worried and thought, "In order to perform the kaimkaryam of the last rites of my mother, I have declined to accept the Lakshminarasimha AsthAnam too. Is the sankalpam of the Lord going to be different?" Saying thus, he went to the sannidhi of Nambi and prayed for seeing his mother. Till then SvAmi has never travelled in train. But due to his extreme affection to his mother, forsaking his vow (vratam) not to travel by train, he went by train to his village. As he hurriedly left, SvAmi forgot to take the SrI BhAshya SrIkoSam (book). He remembered about this midway of his travel. He was worried that in such an emergency situation involving him had lost the book. Meanwhile, his mother’s health condition improved and she recovered from the illness.

Composing several granthams

In the year Nandana, SvAmi participating and worshipping the avatAra utsavam of SrI BhAshyakArar at Sriperumbudur stayed there. A few scholars, who came to attend the utsavam, did their daNDavat praNAmams to SvAmi. They referred to adhikaraNasArAvaLi Slokam, 'द्युभ्वोः Aकर्मप्रसाध्यं' (dyubhvoH karmaprasAdhyam) and raised an objection. According to them in the words, 'न Aभूसुधियोः' (na bhUsudhiyoH), the use of यण् (yaN) has been prohibited [[305]] (nishedha). Therefore, therefore 'द्युभ्वोः' (dyubhvoH) seems to be not correct. SrI SvAmi composed a grantham "yaNprakASam" to counter this objection and to convince them. He composed six Slokams in SragdhAra meter and with detailed commentaries for these Slokams. Similarly whenever the VaishNavAs belonging to tennAcArya sampradAyam raised certain objections, he created granthams then and there to negate those objections in a convincing manner. Those granthams are:

tatkratunyAyasAraH tatkratunyAya cuLakam nyayasiddhAnjana granthagandhaH dAsadAsIsamarthanam makArararakshA sthUNAlinganirNayaH AshADhyupAkarmAbhyanuj~nA tArArthasAraH tArArthasAraprabhA

Besides the above, he composed a grantham, SrImad AdivaN SaThakopa Vaibhava CandrikA, a stotram "tristavI" on the vaibhavam of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar, SrI RanganAtha SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan and a grantham on SrI VedAntadeSika Vaibhava CandrikA.

SvAmi was worried and sad as he did not have SrI BhAshya SrIkoSam for doing the grantha pArAyANam for ten days during the tirunkashatra celebrations of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar in the year Nandana, Kartikai month. He left this SrIkoSam at Tirukkurunkudi before he hurriedly left for his village. Just two days before the start of the tirunakshartra celebrations, one SrI VaishNavar gave SrI BhAshya SrIkoSam to Sri SvAmi. He was immensely happy. SrI SvAmi recited the Sri BhAshya grantham on all the ten days and performed sARRrumural. SrI SvAmi thought that he could get back the koSam because of the anugraham of SrI BhAshyakArar. So to express his gratitude, he composed a stotram, "SrI BhAshyakAra suprabhatam".



[[306]] SrI BhAshya kAlakshepam

SrI SvAmi arrived at Kanchipuram in the month of thai, SvAmi performing his MangaLASAsanam of DevAdirAjan, stayed there for a few days. At that time, some SrI VaishNavAs from Sundapalayam approached SrI SvAmi and requested to bless them with SrI BhAshya kAlakshepam. ILanagar Tirumalai KaTTam SrI SrISailadeSika tAtAchAriyar SvAmi and Tirupullani Raghupathy Iyengar also requested SrI SvAmi to bless them with SrI BhAshya kAlakshepam. All of them had the kAlakshepam with SAnti pATham. On conclusion of the kAlakshepam, SrI BhAshya sARRumurai was done during the summer utsavam of Devarajan in the year Vijaya, Ani month.

Bhagavad Vishaya kAlakshepam

In that year Nandana, Margazhi month, SrI SvAmi went to Sriperumbudur. There, he was worshipping during the irAppattu and pakalppattu utsavams. During the irAppattu sARRumurai, worshipping of AzhvAr tiruvaDi, SrI SvAmi prayed to EmperumAn to give back AzhvAr in order to save the world (lokasamrakshaNArtham AzhvArai prasAdittu aruLa vENum). While praying thus in the sannidhi of Perumal, carrying AzhvAr, one SrI VaishNava presented to SrI SvAmi, Bhagavad Vishaya SrI KoSam on tiruvARayirappaDi commentary. Receiving the SrI KoSam, SrI SvAmi felt that it is the divine order of EmperumAn, EmperumAnAr and AzhvAr indicating him to do Bhagavad Vishaya kAlakshepam. When the anadhyayanam concluded in the month of thai, he approached his AcAryan, sathItyar (classmate), SrI. u. vE. Srinivasaraghavachariar SvAmi of Poovirundavalli, the avatAra sthalam of Tirukacchinambikal and did Bhagavad Vishaya kAlakshepam. This is noted by SrI SvAmi in his PaTTAbhisheka SrI Mukham in the 9th and 10th Slokams.

Kaimkaryam to mother

After the conclusion of the Bhagavad vishaya kAlakshepam, SrI SvAmi proceeded to Kanchipuram. When SvAmi was living there, several wealthy devotees including Neduntheru SrI Narasimha Iyenger approached SrI SvAmi and appealed to him to take ascetic order. SrI SvAmi told them that he will not even think about it as long as his mother is alive.

Later, SrI SvAmi's mother passed away. He performed the last rites without any compromise. Sometime later his wife also had a health setback. SvAmi did not have a son and so did not want to perform the [[307]] last rites of his wife. He called his younger brother to Sriperumbudur and explained his position to him. His younger brother immediately arrived at Sriperumbudur and offered to give his second son, Ramanujan in adoption to SrI SvAmi. As the very next day happened to be an auspicious one, he adopted Ramanujan as his son. Soon after his wife passed away and he organised her last rites through his adopted son.

Gettting initiated with Preshamantram

Next year during the month of Kartikai, when SrI SvAmi was residing in Kanchipuram, he was informed by his Bhagavad Vishaya AcAryan Poovirundavalli SrI Srinivasaraghavachariar SvAmi that he is planning to have Apat sanyAsam (embracing sanyAsam in extreme danger or distress) and asked Sri SvAmi to come and see him. Accordingly, SrI SvAmi rushed to Poovirundavalli. After performing Apat sanyAsam to that SvAmi, SrI SvAmi got initiated into Presha mantram from that SvAmi. After the completion of the final rites of that SvAmi, SrI SvAmi returned to Sriperumbudur.

Blessings of SrI BhAshyakArar

During the month of Margazhi after the irAppattu sARRumurai utsavam, SrI SvAmi was sleeping in his tirumAligai. He had a dream of SrI BhAshyakArar appearing as the uttama ASramar (head) of SrI Ahobila maTham, SrI SvAmi prostrating at his feet and Yatirajar blessing him saying "स्थिरपरिव्राट् Aभव sthiraparivrAT bhava" (you will become the uttama sanyAsi, ASramar).

Later SrI SvAmi went to Kanchipuram, performed upanayanam for his adopted son and stayed there till the Panguni uttira utsavam. He shared the dream he had with people close to him and told them that he will take to ascetic order in the following year in the month of Adi at Thiruvallur. He asked them to bring Denkanikottai SrI Varadaraja mahAdeSikan SvAmi to come and give him a suitable ASrama tirunAmam when he takes up the ascetic order. He proceeded to Sriperumbudur in the month of Cittirai to participate in the SrI BhAshyakArar utsavam.

pUrvASrama vaibhavam concluded



[[308]] Accepting sanyAsa ASramam

During the Hemalamba year, Chittirai month, SrI SvAmi was participating in the SrI BhAshyakArar utsavam at Sriperumbudur. At that time, people were talking among themselves that SrI SvAmi will be proceeding to Thiruvallur in the month of Ani and take up sanyasa ASramam there. On hearing this, the Bhattar at the sannidhi of SrI BhAshyakArar, had SrI SvAmi a viSesha sevA and was presented with kAshAyam (Ochre robe) of YatirAjar and said, "Let the sanyAsASrama sveekAram be done in a grand manner". SrI SvAmi saying "dhanyosmi" accepted the kAshAyam and was very happy to have had such a great bhAgyam from SrI BhAshyakArar. SrI SvAmi took leave of EmperumAnAr and proceeded to Tiruvallur.

SrI SvAmii had his MangaLASAsanam of SrI Veeraraghavan. He stayed at Tiruvallur for ten days. It was decided that in the year Hemalamba, Adi month, Paurnami tithi, Wednesday when the Uttirada nakshatram is in ascendance, SvAmi will take up sanyAsASramam. As desired by SrI SvAmi, Denkanikottai SvAmi was also present at Tiruvallur. One day before the ASrama sveekAram, SrI SvAmi performed jIvasrAddham and after doing mantra japam, observed the jAgaraNa vratam (to stay awake the whole night). Next day morning, SrI SvAmi after completing his morning rituals was reciting the presha mantram at the Kannan sannidhi on the southern bank of the HrttApaNASini tank near the BrundAvanam of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar. At that time when the tirumanjana tIrtham for SrI Veeraraghavan was being taken, the holy insignia (tiruccinnam) was sounded from the northern bank of the tank. This made SrI SvAmi immensely happy. The group of people nearby SrI SvAmi mentioned that this appears to be a direct acknowledgement and approval from SrI Raghavan. SrI SvAmi himself stated this incident in a Slokam composed by him --

इत्थं संप्रार्थितस्त्वं श्रितजनसुलभं किंAगृहेशप्रभो ! मां प्रव्रज्यामन्त्रघोषं नियमयितुमनाः स्वीयचिह्नारवेण। अभ्याशस्यैः श्रुतेन प्रकृAतमनुवचोऽर्थानुसन्धानविघ्नात्

Then, SrImadvedamargetyAti Denkanikottai SvAmi presented to SrI SvAmi the tirunAmam of "SrIvIraraghava SaThakopan".

Since the very same day was the start of cAturmAsya sankalpa day, SrIvIraraghava SaThakopan performed the mrut sangramaNam followed by tirumuDi viLakkam and commenced his first cAturmAsya sankalpam. SrI SvAmi stayed at the ASramam on the southwest corner of the HrttApanAsini tank. Performing MangaLASAsanam of the Lord, tiruevvul KiDantAn daily, he was conducting SrI bhAshya grantha catushTya kAlakshepam to his SishyAs.

SrutigItA Commentary

The District Munsiff of Tiruvallur was well learnt in Sanskrit. He conveyed through many people his desire to have darSan of SrI SvAmi and to offer his prayers. SvAmi saying as to why should they all come here, sent them away. Later, the Munisiff told his desire to taTTai SrI Rangachariyar SvAmi of his wish. SrI Rangachariyar Svami went to Sri SvAmi telling, "Though he is in the post of Munsiff, he is a vidvAn and a Sanskrit scholar. So there is no need to prevent him from having the darSan and to offer his prayer". Accordingly, the Munsiff came one day afternoon and did his praNAmams. SrI SvAmi asked him to sit. He, an advaitin quoted a Slokam, SrutigitA praSna (question) in SrImad BhAgavatam --

ब्रह्मन् ब्रह्मण्यनिर्देश्ये निर्गुणे गुणवृत्तयः। कथं चरन्ति श्रुतयः साक्षात्सदसतः परे॥


[[310]] brahman brahmaNyanirdeSye nirguNe guNavrttayaH | katham caranti SrutayaH sAkshAt sadasataH pare ||

and the samAdAna (response) Slokam --

बुद्धीन्द्रियमनःप्राणान् जानानामसृजत् प्रभुः। आत्मार्थं च भवार्थं च आत्मने कल्पनाय च॥

buddhIndriyamanaHprANAn jAnAnAmasrjat prabhuH | AtmArtham ca bhavArtham ca Atmane kalpanAya ca || and sought the meaning for them.

SrI SvAmi explained to him, the meaning of the two Slokam. It appeared that the Munsiff did not grasp and understand the meaning. The next day itself, SrI SvAmi composed a grantham, "SrutigItA vyAkyAnam" and sent it to the Munsiff. On reading this the Munsiff was very happy.

Composing of argalapancakam

The ever merciful EmpurumAn, SrI Veeraraghavan to His devotees wished to let the world know the bhakti, patience and glory of SrI SvAmi, enacted an incident to test him. On seeing, SrI SvAmi coming to the sannidhi of the Lord to do MangaLASAsanam, few jealous people dropped the barrier (uzhal taDi) which is normally used to stop ordinary folks to enter in to the sannidhi. SrI SvAmi thinking that this may be the wish of SrI Veeraraghavan, did not exhibit any sign of disappointment. He composed and presented the grantham "argaLapancakam" then and there. The sAtvIka devotees were moved by this response and the virtue of the SvAmi. The jealous people were rejoicing over their vengeful act because it was their intention to make Sri SvAmi to suffer. स्वामिन्नेवं पुरानर्गलविसरदयासारपूरैरपारैः बाह्यान्तस्थैः कपाटैः पिहितपरिसरे सन्निधावन्तिकंA द्राक्। प्रापय्येमं जनं द्राक् निजवचनसुधास्वादधन्यं विधातुः किंA ते पादाब्जसेवां विघटयितुमयं दण्ड एषोऽर्गलात्मा॥

[[311]] svAminnevam purAnargala-visaradayAsAra- pUrairapAraiH bAhyAntasthaiH kapATaiH pihitaparisare sanidhAvantikam drAk | prApayyemam janam drAk nijavacanasudhA- svAdadhanyam vidhAtuH kim te pAdAbjasevAm vighaTayitumayam daNDa eshorgalAtmA||

Meaning: SvAmi KinghehanAthA! Earlier, due to Your dayA and compassion, You used to have Your inner and outer doors open to let aDiyEn in without delay. aDiyEn used to recite Slokams in praise of You and the nectar drops of the stotrams made aDiyEn pious whereas this barrier is denying aDiyEn now the darSan of Your Holy Feet.

Neduntheru SrI Narasimha Iyengar, an obedient follower of SrI SvAmi from his pUrvASrama days itself appealed to him to initiate SaraNagati and to perform uktinishThA (repeating the prapatti vAkhyams recited by the AcAryan during prapatti) to him. SrI SvAmi told SrI Narasimha Iyengar, "In that case you have to stay here in the maTham for a few days, undergo CillaRai Rahasya kAlakshepam and learn to recite the prapatti vAkyam. Then only, uktinishTha can be initiated to you. Otherwise, can perform AcAryanishTha for you". (AcAryan performs prapatti on behalf of his disciple). To avoid further delay, SrI Narasimha Iyengar appealed to SrI SvAmi to perform AcAryanishThA. On that day, the pavitrotsavam festival was taking place in SrI Raghavan sannidhi. SrI Raghavan was holding court in the mirror room. SaraNAgati for SrI Narasimha Iyengar was performed there itself.

Another unfortunate incident

Another unfortunate incident happened to SrI SvAmi. Encouraged by the jealous people, one deceitful person entering into the ASramam stole the SaalagrAma mUrti of SvAmi and fruits etc., kept for offering (nivedanam) to the mUrti. SrI SvAmi learnt about this the following morning.


[[312]] वरं हुतवहज्वालापञ्जरान्तर्व्यवस्थितिः। न शौरिचिन्ताविमुखजनसंवासवैशसम् ॥
varam hutavahajvAlApanjarAntarvyavasthitiH | na SauricintAvimukhajanasamvAsavaiSam||

--- Thus it would be better to stay away from the place where such
people live and have no bhakti to BhagavAn (if one has devotion towards the Lord, it is to be inferred that they will be having devotion to the BhAgavatAs too). As the cAturmAsya vratam was yet to be completed, he could not leave from Tiruvallur. He was waiting for the cAturmAsyam to conclude and for utthAna sancAra time. Some of the devout persons who came to know of this instance presented some SaalagrAmams to SrI SvAmi for performing tiruvArAdhanam. They were very disturbed and said, "In the kingdom of Ravana lived pious people like Vibheeshanan. Likewise in the holy abode of SrI Raghavan some cruel people also live". They were very sad.

Once the cAturmAsyam concluded, SrI SvAmi wanted to go to Perumal Koyil (Kanchipuram). He reached a nearby agrahAram. Later, SrI SvAmi reached Kanchipuram via Neeralur in the month of Kartikai when the Hasta nakshatram was in ascendance. He proceeded to the temple and performed MangaLASAsanam of Devadirajan and recited the Slokam:

योऽसौ मेधाश्रुताद्यैर्दुरधिगमतयाऽगायि शास्त्रैकयोनिः यं चासूत्रि त्रयीयं परनिरसनतो नेति नेत्याह चैनम् ।
वेधोलब्धाश्वमेधो करिगिरिशिखरे वीक्ष्य हृष्टो यदक्षे संजातं देवराजं वरदमिमहं तत्र हस्ते समीक्षे॥

yo'sau medhASrutAdyairduradhigamatayA'gAyi SAstraikayoniH yam cAsUtri trayIyam paranirasanato neti netyAha cainam | vedholabdhASvamedho karigiriSikhare vIkshya hrshTo yadakshe [[313]] samjAtam devarAjam varadamimaham tatra haste samIkshe ||

Then, he went to the ASramam built for his stay, in the street behind Anaikatti Street. During his stay there for a few days, several SvAmis had their kAlakshepam on RahasyatrayasAram, SrI BhAshyam and other granthams. Lot of bhAgavtAs got their SaraNAgati performed at the holy eet of SrI SvAmi. During the month of Margazhi, SrI SvAmi composed "SArIraka suprabhAtam" based on the vAkyams of the Slokams in "SArIraka adhikaraNam". SvAmi was reciting “SArIraka suprabhAtam” before tirupaLLiyezhucchi. This composition, on Devaperumal captured the essence of the meanings of the SrI BhAshyam. VidvAn SrI u. vE. ChinnA Raa. mu. Srinivasa Paatracharya SvAmi has written a commentary in Tamil for easy understanding. After this SvAmi ascended to tirunAdu, SrI. u. vE. Villivalam VedAntavAvadhuka Naryayanacharyar SvAmi completed the remaining portion. "SArIraka suprabhAtam" with its commentaries has been published in Nrusimhapriya as a series.

Note: The English translation of "SArIraka suprabhAtam" can be accessed at www.sadagopan.org, Ahobilavalli series e book # 108.

Since GodAstuti has only twenty nine pAsurams and as such not able to recite on all the thirty days during Margazhi like the thirty pAsurams of tiruppAvai, SrI SvAmi composed a Slokam

भक्तिप्रकर्षपरिणाममयाङ्गि गोदे युक्ताहि कृAष्णविभवानुभवाय गाथाः। त्रिंश्त् कृAतार्थयितुमाप्तजनं त्वयोक्ताः गोपीष्विव त्वयि ततस्त तथा व्युमुह्यत् ॥

bhaktiprakarsha pariNAmamayAngi gode yuktAhi krshNavibhavAnubhavAya gAthAH | trimSat krtArthayitum Aptajanam tvayoktAH gopIshviva tvayi tataH tathA vyumuhyat ||

[[314]]
-- as the 28th Slokam and then was reciting the "Satamakha maNi
nIlA" and "iti vikasita bhakteH” (28th and 29th Slokams of GodAstuti) Slokams after the above Slokam.

Then on another occasion, he composed a grantham named “vedAnta kaustubha sAram" comprising of three hundred Slokams in sragdharA meter. The learned pandits of those times were full of praise for this work which was packed with esoteric meanings and immaculate style in the choice of words used.

SrI SvAmi staying in Kanchipuram Perumal Kovil was thus composing granthams, doing kAlakshepam on SrI BhAshyam and other granthams to his SishyAs and performing MangaLASAsanam to PerArulAlan daily.

At that time, SrI ayyA Raghunatha Tatacharya SvAmi of Kanchipuram wished to consecrate the vigraham of SvAmi DeSikan. He got made a silver bell. This was consecrated in the sannidhi of Tiruvengadamudaiyan. Daily ArAdhanam was conducted for the bell for a month at the sannidhi. Later the bell was brought to Kanchipuram Perumal Kovil. With addition of four other metals to the Silver bell, it was casted (as an alloy of five metals/panca ulogam) to sculpt the divya mangala vigraham of SvAmi DeSikan. He was thinking of consecrating the vigraham.

It was the first day of the month of Masi. SrI SvAmi had a dream wherein he heard a voice of someone telling him, "भद्रो Aमासोऽद्य वेदान्तगुरुरुदीयात् bhadro mAso'dya vedAntagururudIyAt" (This is Purattasi month. SrI VedAntadeSikan is going to incarnate). On hearing this, SvAmi waking up, was saying, "What a surprise! Today is the Kumbha sangrahmaNa day, whereas we (SvAmi) heard a voice in the dream saying that it is Purattasi month and that SvAmi DeSikan's incarnation will take place! Dream is always true". Thinking of these, he was reciting holy names of the Lord and stotrams. After completing his daily rituals and abhigamana ArAdhanam, SvAmi proceeded for rendering kAlakshepam to the disciples.

At that time, SrI ayyA Raghunatha TAtAchArya SvAmi arrived with the divya mangala vigraham of SvAmi DeSikan. He requested SrI SVAmi to get the vigraham consecrated in the sannidhi of Thiruvallur SrI Raghavan and after performing MangaLASAsanam to return the vigraham to him. [[315]] SrI SvAmi narrated the dream he had in the early hours of the day and was wondering that the bhAgavata niyamanam is also like that of AcArya niyamanam. SrI SvAmi taking leave of PeraruLALan, with the help of the SishyAs took the divya mangala vigraham and went to Thiruvallur. Through the arcakAs of SrI Raghavan sannidhi, the consecration was performed per procedures of PaancarAtra Agamam in the month of Masi when the JyeshTha nakshatram was in ascendance. Then MangaLASAsanam was performed to SrI Raghavan and Kanakavalli tAyAr. The arcA vigraham was installed in the sannidhi of AdivaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan. TiruvArAdhanam etc., were performed there. As per the direction of SrI SvAmi, after the honours of garland and SaThAri honours to SvAmi DeSikan, the honours were offered to AdivaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahadeSikan during the utsavam procession of SrI Raghavan through the veedhis of Thiruvallur. SrI SvAmi stayed there for a few days.

This divya mangala vigraham of SvAmi DeSikan consecrated by SrI SvAmi is now at the Thiruvallikeni ahobila maTham. Daily ArAdhanam is being done there. Due to the strength (balam) of MangaLASAsanam of SrI Raghavan and the divine touch (karasparSam) of the mahA bhAgavta Pillaipakkam SrI SvAmi, grand utsavams are conducted as well daily ArAdhanams. From that day onwards till now without any break, Purattasi SravaNa utsavam are conducted in a grand manner as a ten day long festival. Daily twice a day, during the procession through the mADa veedhis, reciting of divya Prabandham and Veda pArayaNam by ghoshThI, tadhiyAradhanam with special prasAdams (panca bhakshyams) are conducted. On the day of sARRumural, about two hundred SvAmis recite divya Prabandham and Veda pArayaNam. The sound of Prabandham and Vedam reverberates in all directions making everybody happier and good experience. SrI maTham administrators honour all the participating SvAmis with special sambhAvanA. The glory of this utsavam is increasing year after year. Can there be any other reason to this than the noble and holy blessings of SrI SvAmi?

Staying in Thiruvallur for a few days, SvAmi was worshipping SrI Raghavan's Chittirai utsavam. After the conclusion of the utsavam, SrI SvAmi proceeded to perform MangaLASAsanam of Bhaktavatsalan at Thiruninravur, Tirukkacchinambikal at Poovirundavalli, Tirumazhicai PirAn at Tirumazhicai, BhAshyakArar at Sriperumbudur et al. He then arrived at Kanchipuram Perumal Kovil. That year's cAturmAsya sankalpam was performed at Kanchipuram.

[[316]] After the conclusion of cAturmAsyam, he returned to Thiruvallur. Sri SvAmi making a sankaplam to go to Tirumala proceeded via Nagalapuram to reach Thirucchanoor and Lower Tiruppati. After performing MangaLASAsanam to Alarmelmangai tAyAr and SrI Govindaraja Perumal, he arrived at Tirumalai. After his MangaLASAsanam to Thiruvengadamudaiyan, he returned to Thirucchanoor. Establishing an ASramam near the Perumal sannidhi on the banks of SvarNamukhi, SrI SvAmi stayed there for a few days. He used to go to Tirumalai often to perform MangaLASAsanam of Thiruvengadamudaiyan but never stayed there. He stayed at Thirucchanoor till the month of Margazhi. On the Margazhi Sukla ekAdaSI day, after MangaLASAsanam of Thiruvengadamudaiyan, taking leave of the Lord, he returned to Thiruvallur for the Bhogi tirukkalyANa celebrations of SrI Andal.

Administration of SrInrusimha AsthAnam

When Sri Pillaipakkam SvAmi was in Thiruvallur to participate in the Bhogi tirukkalyANa utsavam of SrI Andal, 36th paTTam, SrI Srinivasa mahadeSikan suddenly ascended to paramapadam. He had not designated anyone to succeed him the AsthAna pITham. Therefore, in the year Vilambi, thai month, 10th day, Sukla ekAdaSI, Sunday when RohiNi nakshatram was in ascendance, SrI sannidhi vidvAns and some AstikAs, got together at Perumpakkam agrahAram. They discussed as to whom should be designated as the successor for the administration of the AsthAnam. They all decided unanimously stating, "Pillaipakkam SvAmi belonging to SrI Sannidhi has taken to ascetic order. We will appeal to him to take over the administration of the AsthAnam and to perform the tiruvArAdhanam of SrI LakshmInrusimhan". SrI LakshmInrusimhan blessed them all to arrive at such a unanimous decision.

Thirukkudantai SrI Chakravarthyacharya SvAmi (who later became the 38th Azhagiyasingar), SrI taTTai RangacharyAr SvAmi (a reputed scholar, publisher of VedAntadIpikA journal, Sub Judge and father of SrI T.T. Krishnamachari), ParuttippaTTu Vangeepuram SrI Thiruvenkatachariyar SvAmi (father of 43rd paTTam Devanarvilagam Azhagiyasingar) and others came to Thiruvallur. Further, hundreds of other vaidika AstikAs also joined the three of the above SvAmis and through these SvAmis appealed to SrI SvAmi, the wishes of SrI LakshmInrusimhan. SrI SvAmi saying, "dhanyosmi, anugrihitosmi", accepted their request. They then prayed to SrI SvAmi to perform MangaLASAsanam of SrI Raghavan. The temple honours such as chatra, cAmara and other paraphernalia were brought from the [[317]] temple. SrI SvAmi asserted that right from the beginning, due the anugraham of SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan that he could get all these honours. He further said that he will proceed for the MangaLASAsanam at the behest of SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan. SrI SvAmi placing the divya mangala vigraham of SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan in a golden palanquin went in a procession around the mADa veedhis of Thiruvallur with all the temple honours to SrI Raghvan sannidhi. After getting done all the honours to SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan, SvAmi did his MangaLASAnam to SrI Raghavan.

He proceeded to the sannidhi of SrImad Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra MahAdeSikan with the arcA of the jIyar. In the sannidhi, he installed back the arcA of the jIyar. After accepting the garland, parivaTTam and other honours of the MahAdeSikan, he returned to maTham. Next day itself he proceeded on foot to Perumpakkam village with a few disciples and reached there after five to six days. After naming the village as "dakshiNa ahobilam", SvAmi went to the sannidhi of SrI LakshmInrusimhan. There, after reciting SArIraka suprabhAtam and other granthams, performing MangaLASAsanam, completed abhigamana ArAdhanam. He accepted the Hamsa mudrA and took over the administration of the AsthAnam.

MangaLASAsanam of SrI Raghavan

SrI Azhagiyasingar staying in Perumpakkam for two or three days was performing the ArAdhanam of SrI LakshmInrusimhan. He wanted to worship in thai brahmotsavam of SrI Raghavan. SrI LakshmInrusimhan was placed in a small palanquin and it was carried by a few SvAmis. He started his travel (anuyAtrA) on foot behind the palanquin with the disciples. The disciples appealed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to sit in the palanquin itself. SrI Azhagiyasingar saying that ever since he took to sanyASramam has been travelling on foot only for several years and he continued on foot. En route, at Madurantakam, he performed MangaLASAsanam of SrI Kodandaraman, SrI Karunakaran, SrI Jankavalli tAyAr, Periya Nambigal and BhAshyakArar. From there, he went to Thiruvallur on thai amAvasyai day. There he performed MangaLASAsanam to SrI Veeraraghavan.

On that day he performed tiruvArAdhanam for SrI LakshmInrusimhan in the sannidhi of BhAshyakArar. Next day he reached the maTham along with SrI LakshmInrusimhan and was performing ArAdhanam.

[[318]] SahasrakalaSAbhishekam

After the conclusion of the thai brahmotsavam of SrI Raghavan and the tIrthavAri, Azhagiyasingar organised a SahasrakalaSAbhishekam for SrI Nrusimhan according to pAncaratra samhitA and special tiruvArAdhanam in a grand manner. During mAtrAdAnam time, Azhagiyasingar presented to all the vidvAns and kainkaryaparars, each with about one thousand rupees (which was a huge amount in those days) and also dhoti, shawls etc., to each vidvAn as if they are presented by the wishes of SrI LakshmInrusimhan Himself. This practice of the presenting such honours at the time of mAtrAdAnam to all the ArAdhakars and VidvAns is continued even today.

dakshiNadeSa yAtrA

The paTTabhisheka SrImukhams of SrI Azhagiyasingar were sent to the disciples all over the world in the month of Masi, 12th day. Sri Azhagiyasingar stayed at Thiruvallur till VikAri year, Chittirai month. Then he started on his sancAram to perform MangaLASAsanam of AzhvAr at Alwar Thirunagari. SrI Azhagiyasingar wished to perform the cAturmAsya sankalpam at Thiruvaheendrapuram divya deSam and with this thought he started on his travel.

From Thiruvallur he arrived at Kanchipuram Perumal Koyil. He wanted to perform MangaLASAsanam of Devadirajan. However there was some misunderstanding between the trusties (dharmakartAs) and the arcakAs. As such the trusties prostrated at the feet of SrI Azhagiyasingar and appealed to him saying, "At this time, it may not be possible to offer the temple honours properly and this may cause disrespect to SrI Azhagiyasingar. It is our duty to extend full honours whereas this may turn out to be right opposite and may result in causing indignity. Hence it will be helpful if you come for MangaLASAsanam at some other time". SrI Azhagiyasingar understanding the sensitivity of their request, left with a heavy heart on not being able to perform MangaLASAsanam. He travelled to Thiruvaheendrapuram via dhUci Maamandur.

SrI Azhagiyasingar observed his cAturmAsyam at Thiruvaheendrapuram. His daily routine was to take bath in the Garuda nadI near the ASramam, complete the morning rituals and to come back to the maTham to perform the abhigamana ArAdhanam. After this, SrI BhAshya kAlakshepam would take place. The Thiruvaheendrapura vidvAns, such as Dharmapuri SrI SadagopachAriyar SvAmi, SadAvadAnam SrI AnanthAchariyar SvAmi, [[319]] SrI Devanathachariyar SvAmi, Chetlur SrI Narasimhachariyar SvAmi and others used to attend the kAlakshepam. At that time, renowned scholars such as Thirukkudantai ChakravarthyachAriyar SvAmi, (later to be Thirukkudantai Azhgiyasingar), Srimushnam SvarNam Krishnamachariyar SvAmi and others used to render kAlakshepams.

On the auspicious occasion of tirunakshatra days of AzhvArs and AcAryAs Vedam, Prabandham, grantha catushTyam (SrI BhAshyam, gIta BhAshyam, Bhagavad Vishayam and RahasyatrayasAram) recitation were used to be conducted. SrI Azhagiyasingar used to offer sambhAvanA liberally to the participating scholars. He used to go to the tirumAligai of SvAmi DeSikan for the mAdhyAnika snAnam (afternoon bath). While taking the water from the well constructed by SvAmi DeSikan himself, Azhagiyasingar used to recite the Slokam -

वेदान्तगुरुणा क्लृप्ते कूAपेऽस्मिन् विरजोपमे। स्नातो वेदान्तनिष्णातो भवत्येव न संशयः॥

vedAntaguruNA klupte kUpe asmin virajopame | snAto vedAntanishNAto bhavatyeva na samSayaH ||

"This well constructed by SvAmi VedAntadeSikan, the water in this well is as sacred as the VirajA nadI. One who takes bath in this water will gain mastery in VedAntam and there is no doubt about it".

After performing the mAdhyahnikam, SrI Azhagiyasingar will return to the SrI sannidhi to perform mangala hAratti and after partaking the tIrtha prasAdam will retire to his ASramam. Making a sankalpam for bhikshA and accepting bhikshA, the rituals will be concluded. This was a daily routine.

In the afternoon, SrImad RahasyatrayasAra kAlakshepam used to take place. In the evening, SrI Azhagiyasingar after taking bath in Garuda nadI, completing the rituals, used to offer his MangaLASAsanam to SrI Devanathan and SvAmi DeSikan. While returning to the maTham, he used to be reciting YatirAja saptati. We heard elders saying that those were fortunate to have a darSan of the group full of scholars, paramaikAntis and AstikAs were blessed indeed.

[[320]] Thus, while Sri Azhagiyasingar was camping at Thiruvaheendrapuram considered superior to staying at SrI VaikuNTham, the residents of this divya deSam with so much enthusiasm were competing with each other in the recitation of ubhaya vedAntam, saying, "I am first, I am first" (with one group reciting divya prabandhams and the other in Vedam). There were some disagreement and disturbances among them as to who is better (in prabandha or Veda recitation). This situation was like the muktars (liberated souls) in SrI VaikuNTham where, one will say that in the kalyANa guNam (auspicious attributes) of BhagAvan, His affection (vAtsalyam) is matchless, the other will say His audAryam/generosity is superior, another praising his kAruNyam (compassion/dayA). This discussion and counter discussion (vAda prativAdam) will keep going on and on for a long time. SrI Azhagayasingar wishing to bring an understanding between the two groups called the important persons belonging to the two groups and counselled them and resolved the problems. So happy with the auspicious attributes of SrI Azhagiyasingar, they overcame their differences and with respect obeyed his direction and were friendly. Noting the response of them, SrI Azhagiyasingar praised the glory of this divya deSam, thus --

अहो भाग्यमहो भाग्यमहीन्द्रपुरवासिनोः। दंपत्योर्देशिकाख्यं यदपत्यमिति कथ्यते॥

aho bhAgyamaho bhAgyam ahIndrapuravAsinoH | dampatyordeSikAravyam yadapatyamiti kathyate ||

After a few days, SrI Azhagiyasingar wished to take the divya mangala vigraham of SrI Devanathan and SvAmi DeSikan to the maTham to perform ArAdhanam there. The residents of the town consented to this. Then one day, the divya mangala vigraham of SrI Devanathan and SvAmi DeSikan were brought to SrI mAThAm. Sri Azhagiyasingar performed ArAdhanam and gave away special sambhAvanA. Special taLikai (food) was prepared and offered to Perumal and SvAmi DeSikan. The temple workers and the Veda Prabandha group of SvAmis were given liberal sambhAvanA. SrI Azhagiyasingar was very happy. At the conclusion of the cAturmAsya sankalpam, SrI Azhagiyasingar proceeded with SrI LakshmInrusimhan to an agrahAram, NattappaTTu. When SrI Azhgiyasingar returned back to Thiruvaheendrapuram, he was accorded grand reception by all [[321]] SvAmis. It was more grandeur than the Sri sannidhi devasthAnam of Thiruvallur.

During the Purattasi avatAra utsavam of SvAmi DeSikan, every time SrI Azhagiyasingar was used to be received at the temple and used to have viSesha darSan. After this only, the procession of SvAmi DeSikan through the streets will take place. SrI Azhagiyasingar was very happy to have the darSan of SvAmi DeSikan in the vAhanams and by worshiping SvAmi DeSikan in the mirror room. He composed a grantham, "SrI VedAnta deSikotsavamAlikA" to narrate his anubhavam and the enjoyment he had of SvAmi DeSikan on various vAhanams with beautiful alamkArams during the ten day festival and for the anubhavam by future generation. This work was printed in ganthAksharam.

Note: Translation of "SrI VedAnta deSikotsavamAlikA" can be accessed at www.sadagopan.org, Sri HayagrIvan series, e book # 12.

Renovation of the tirumAlikai of SrI DeDikan

After the conclusion of the utsavam of SrI DeSikan, SrI Azhagiyasingar wanted to renovate the tirumAlikai of SrI DeSikan. The residents prayed to Sri Azhagiyasingar to formally inaugurate the commencement of renovation work in the month of aippasi. A silver trowel (a tool used by mason for leveling the cement or mud floor) was made and it was presented to SrI Azhagiyasingar. The residents prayed to him to use the trowel and formally inaugurate the renovation work on an auspicious date and time. Sri Azhagiaysingar directed them to give the trowel to Thirukkudantai SrI Chakravathiyachariyar SvAmi (Thirukkudantai Azhagiyasingar's pUrvASrama name). Accordingly as directed by SrI Azhagiyasingar, that SvAmi formally inaugurated the work. With sufficient funds arranged for the renovation work from SrI maTham, SrI Chakravarthiyachariyar SvAmi, ParuttippaTTu SrI Thiruvengadachariyar SvAmi and other disciples, the renovation work was completed quickly. The building was constructed with a spacious hall (maNTapam). During the festivals, SrI Devanathan and SvAmi DeSikan hold the court in this hall and special prayers are conducted here.

Travel to SrI Nrusimhapuram

SrI Azhagiyasingar stayed in Thiruvaheendrapuram till the end of aippasi. He wanted to celebrate the tirunakshatram of AttippaTTu [[322]] Azhagiyasingar at SrI Nrusimhapuram in the month of Kartikai. With that in thought, he directed his SishyAs and others to commence the travel on an auspicious day at day break (aruNodayam). Everyone was ready for the travel. As SrI Devanathan and SvAmi DeSikan were not willing to be separated from Sri Azhagiyasingar, thick clouds were formed in all the four directions and heavy rain started and continued without any let. The travel plans were stopped. After a week, when the sancAram was started, SrI Azhagiyasingar when coming out of the SrI maTham banged his head on the door frame. The local SvAmis and the kaimkaryaparars suggested to postpone the travel to some other day. In spite of the request, Sri Azhagiyasingar started his sancAram. He arrived at SrI Narasimhapurm on the date of commencement of the AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar tirunakshatra celebrations at about ten o'clock (10:00) in the morning. He was very tired as he travelled by foot.

The blessing received at the Nrusimhapuram BrundAvanam

There, after his his bath in the tank nearby, and completing his rituals, offered prayers at the BrundAvanams on the bank of the tank. He then reached SrI maTham. At that time one SvAmi came to SrI Azhagiyasingar and informed him that there is space for one more BrundAvanam to be built in the middle among the BrundAvanams. He showed SvAmi the location. SrI Azhagiyasingar on listening to this, thought about the greatness of Periya Srinivasa MahadeSikan, known as SAbhAnugraha SvAmi. SrI Azhagiyasingar closing his eyes for a few minutes, reflected on the glory of the three great Azhagiyasingars whose BrundAvanam were located there. He wondered as to whether he will be fortunate enough to have his BrundAvanam also located here. At that time three Garudans (eagles) circling in the sky right over the head of SrI Azhagiyasingar were making noise. This was noticed by some SvAmis. They told about this to SrI Azhagiyasingar. He opened his eyes and noticed the eagles. He was surprised and was saying, "I am the only one who has returned back to earth now from VaikuNTham where there is no rebirth (punarAvrttii)". Thus indicating that while at the time of meditating here, it seemed that he was in VaikuNTham along with these three Azhagiyasingars and when they called again he returned back to VaikuNTham. He reached SrI maTham to commence the inauguration of the tirunakshatra celebrations of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar on that day and completed abhigamana ArAdhanam to the accompaniment of ubhaya vedAnta pArAyaNam. In the afternoon around three after mAdhyAhnikam and Mangala hAratti, directed the kaimkaryaparars to start the tadhIiyArAdhanam. He then retired to his ASramam. Around five [[323]] o'clock in the evening, after bhikshA, that day's proceedings were concluded. This was the daily routine. On the day, when the Uttirada nakshatram was in ascendance the tirunakshatra mahotsavam was celebrated in a grand manner. All those who attended were given special sambhAvanA.

SrI Azhagiyasingar was tired and had a setback to his health due to the fast travel on foot to reach in time Nrusimhapuram in Pullambhutamkudi to commence the AttipaTTu Azhagiyasingar's tirunakshatra celebration in a grand manner lasting for ten days and to offer SrI SaThAri, SrI pAda tIrtham and mantrAkshada to a large assembly of SishyAs. He could not get the deha Suddhi done because of some sort of stomach ailment. Even after taking castor oil, there was no improvement. Day by day, his health was deteriorating.

At that time, Thirukkudantai SrI Chakravarthiyachariyar SvAmi prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to perform SaraNAgati to him. In response, SrI Azhagiyasingar curtly told him, "You go to Setu (Thirupullani) on foot, take a bath in the sea, come back and then will perform SaraNAgati". Accordingly as per the direction of the AcAryan, making a sankalpam and after making dAnams, he started his travel for Setu snAnam.

The health of SrI Azhagiyasingar was deteriorating fast. This news spread across the region. On learning about this development, several important SishyAs such as SrI Mushnam SvAmi came to SrI sannidhi. They prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to perform ubhaya anushThAnam (SaraNAgati) to them. Accordingly SrI Azhagiyasingar acceding to their prayers performed SaraNAgati through uktinishTha route. They conveyed these details to Thirukkudantai SvAmi by telegram. That SvAmi thought about it for a while and decided that he does not want to lose his sambandham (connection) of SrI Azhagiyasingar and that Prapatti is much more important than Setu snAnam. So, he hurried back by train. He expressed his sadness at the sannidhi of SrI Azhagiyasingar and prayed to him to perform ubhaya anushThAnam to him then and there. Accordingly, SaraNAgati through uktinishThA was performed and thus the wish of that SvAmi was fulfilled. The next day, Thirukkudantai SvAmi prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to initiate preshamantiram. Accordingly, preshamantiram was initiated to that SvAmi and a few other SvAmis also.

The AstikAs residing in the region were thinking that SrI Azhagiyasingar will be visiting their villages and towns soon and that they should offer their prayers to Malolan and SrI Azhagiyasingar. On learning about the deteriorating health of SrI Azhagiyasingar, they in [[324]] several groups arrived at Nrusimhapuram. They all prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar to perform SaraNAgati to them. SrI Azhagiayasingar as per pramANam --

yadrucchayopasanAnAm deSAndaranivAsinAm | ishTopadeSaH kartavyo nArAyaNratAtmanAm ||
--performed ubhAya anushThAnam to all those who prayed to him.

Leaving for nityavibhUti

Thus, SrImad Azhagiyasingar was performing SaraNAgati to disciples for the upliftment of them untill he had his memory faculty and strength. Even while he was bedridden, he was reciting the Prapatti vAkyams and pAdukAsahasra Slokams for three days. As his memory was failing day by day, no one could approach him to take his guidance on further things to do. In such a gloomy situation, they were all worried and sad. SrI Azhagiyasingar without assigning his successor ascended to Paramapadam (nityavibhUti) in the year VikAri, Marghazi month 2nd, Paurnami tithi, Saturday, Asvini nakshatram, 16th December 1899. In that year, Nrusimhapuram and adjacent villages were affected with severe drought due to failure of monsoon. All crops withered. Also that day happened to be the day of Lunar eclipse. All the elderly people were dull and week due to fasting. The situation was so gloomy that it resembled the day when SrI Chakravarti Tirumakan left his kingdom to go to daNDakAraNyam forest -

"api vrkshAH parimlAnAH sapushpAnkuragorakAH (pushpitAgrANi) ..."

On that day, SrI Azhagiyasingar was just one month short of fifty five years of age. After taking up sanyAsa ASramam, he had performed two cAturmAsyams and one after ascending to AsthAnam.

On learning about SrI Azhagiyasingar attaining paramapadam, the scholars and others felt very sad. At that time, reputed scholars such as Navalpakkam SvAmi of Valayapettai agrahAram and Thiruvisainallur Brahmasri MahAmahopadhyAya RamasubbA Saastrigal were praising eloquently the knowledge, his vairAgyam, and discipline.
