This Azhagiyasingar was born in Pullambhuthamkudi divya deSam on Adi month, Uttarada nakshatram. He ascended to the AsthAnam of Ahobila maTham, in Nala samvatsaram, aippasi month (October 1676), Krishna paksha Pancami tithi.

He stayed at Srirangam for a few days. At that time, a few SishyAs approached him and asked for the blessings of their AcAryan for creating a grantham praising on the glories of our AcArya lineage (GuruparamaparA PrabhAvam). Responding to their plea, SrImad Azhagiyasingar created a new grantham, "AcArya guNadarSam". He did upadeSam on the content of this grantham elaborately. He advised his SishyAs to rely on this grantham for their succor (ujjIvanam) and spiritual well being.

This Azhagiyasingar on sancAram to Tirukkudantai (Kumbakonam) did his MangaLASAsanam to ArAvamudan and returned to Pullambhuthamkudi. There, he did his MangaLASAsanam to SrI Hemabjavalli sameta SrI Valvili Raman and did some kaimkaryams. He visited many divya deSams while residing at his birth place permanently. On an Akshaya samvatsaram, Adi month (August 1686), amAvAsya tithi, he ascended to SrI VaikuNTham from Tirukkandiyur divya deSam.

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 9 years, 10 months
