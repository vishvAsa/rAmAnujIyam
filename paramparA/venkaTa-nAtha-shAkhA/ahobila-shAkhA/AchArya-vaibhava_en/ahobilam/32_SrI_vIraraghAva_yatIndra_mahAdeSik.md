This Azhagiyasingar was born in Srivilliputthur in the month of Chittirai, PooraTTAti nakshatram. His ancestral village is Adanur. Hence he was known as "Adanur Azhagiyasingar". He ascended the Ahobila maTha SimhAsanam in ParAbhava year, Panguni month, 19th day (30th March, 1847).

The Azhagiyasingar left Thyagarajapuram on sancAram to Pullambhuthamkudi (SrInrusimhapuram), AdanUr et al and had his MangaLASAsanam of these EmperumAns. He then went to Srirangam Periya Koyil and after his MangaLASAsanam of Periya Perumal there, went on sancAram to nava tiruppatis of Azhvar Tirunagari etc. After his MangaLASAsanams of the EmperumAns of Vanamamalai and Tirukkurunkudi, he arrived at Madurai. Here, he worshipped at the divya desams of Koodalazhakar, KaLLazhagar and other divya deSa EmperumAns near by. He then returned to Mannargudi.

From Mannargudi, he arrived at Kanchipuram via many divya deSams. He had his MangaLASAsanams of Devapperumal and Perumdevi tAyAr. He had the sevA of the EmperumAns of the eighteen divya deSams in and around Kanchipuram. He then left for Tirunarayanapuram via Tirupputkuzhi. After arriving at Tirunarayanapuram, he completed his anushThAnams at Kalyani Saras and thereafter worshipped at the sannidhis of Sampathkumaran and Yadugiri Nacchiyar. During his stay at Tirunarayanapuram, the King of Mysore, SrI Krishnaraja Kanteerava sArvabhauman prayed to Azhagiyasingar to visit the Mysore samsthAnam. Accordingly, he accepted the invitation and traveled to Mysore. The king welcomed the jIyar with great reverence and performed many ArAdhanams for Malolan. After blessing the Mysore Maharaja, SrImad Azhagiyasingar reached Tirumalai via Cholasimhapuram and arrived at Thiruvallur. Here, he took his bath in HrttApanASani Saras, observed his daily rituals and had the MangaLAsAsanams of SrI Veeraraghava Perumal and [[275]] Kanakavalli tAyAr. Moved by Their welcoming anugrahams, SrImad Azhagiyasingar decided to reside permanently at Thiruvallur.

When this Azhagiyasingar ascended to the AsthAnam, he was very old. Hence he was addressed by his SishyAs as "tAtA SvAmi". He ignored about his delicate health status and went on long sancArams to bless his dear SishyAs.

Seeking his successor for the administration of SrI maTham AsthAnam, the Azhagiyasingar invited many old scholars and discussed with them, their interest in succeeding him. Giving some reasons, they all declined to accept this noble sthAnam.

Azhagiyasingar then compelled one of the distinguished scholars who was having his kAlakshepam of SrI BhAshyam and others under him (the AcAryan), to accept the responsibilities of SrI maTham AsthAnam. He was the embodiment of courage, power and j~nAnam. He was very young and just twenty six years old only. This SvAmi said that he will accept the sthAnam if it was also the command of Malolan. At that time, the auspicious sound of a bell was heard suggesting that it was the Lord's command as well. People standing around there were astonished by the Lord's timely signal. Next day, presha mantropadeSam was performed by the senior Yati to the young scholar, Parantur Vangeepuram SrI VedAntachArya SvAmi. He was given the sanyASrama tirunAmam of SrI SaThakOpa yatIndra mahAdeSikan. Both the Azhagiyasingars reigned together as Periya and cinna Azhagiyasingars.

Periya Azhagiyasingar ascended to Paramapadam in PramAdISa year, Purattasi month, 21st, Sukla paksha caturti tithi, Wednesday (30 October 1853).
