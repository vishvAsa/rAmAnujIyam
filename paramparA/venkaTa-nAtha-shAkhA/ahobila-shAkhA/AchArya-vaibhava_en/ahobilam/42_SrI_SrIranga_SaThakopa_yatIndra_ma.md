He had his kAlakshepam under SvarNam SrI Krishnamacharya mahAdeSikan, popularly known as SrI Mushnam SvAmi, the SishyA of Pillaipakkam Azhagiyasingar. Our SvAmi used to recite the mantrAs initiated to him by SrI Mushnam SvAmi. He was doing noble deeds and lived a life focussed on the liberation of the soul. Thirukkudantai Azhagiyasingar (38th paTTam) used to compliment and praise our SvAmi’s mastery and proficiency in VedAnta SAstrAs. SrIlakshmInrsimha SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan (41st paTTam Azhagiyasingar) had appointed our SvAmi as the AsthAna VidvAn.

During his AsthAna time, he composed an elaborate commentary on SrImadrahasyatrayasAram namely "sArabodhinI". He also authored the following granthams:

His paTTAbhishekam to the simhAsanam was in the year Vishu, aippasi month (24 October 1941). He took a vow to establish during his nirvAka kAlam, a Veda Prabandha pAThaSAlA at Madurantakam, organize Malola vidvat sadas, publish SrInrusimhapriyA magazine, and build a branch Ahobila maTham at Mumbai. Accordingly he was working on these good deeds. He rendered grantha catushTya kAlakshepam to about fifty learned scholars and SiromaNis. He conducted himself in such a noble manner that people belonging to other religions and other ideologies praised him as a highly intellectual SvAmi of great vairAgyam (complete disinterest in worldly pleasures) in strictly adhering to the religious practices. He was filled with the attributes such as patience, tranquillity and generosity. He was the example of the virtuous quality of patience. Even on the rarest of rare occasion when he used to be annoyed he will only say "You fool" and nothing more.

He travelled from Srirangam to Hyderabad and in the West to Thirunarayanapuram. He performed MangaLASAsanam to all the EmperumAns on the way. He had special bondage towards Attigiri PeraruLALan. He gave importance to the worship of arcAvatAram. During his last days, he stayed permanently at Thiruvallur. Owing to failing health he appointed ParuttippaTTu Vangeepuram SrI. u. vE. VidvAn Lakshminrusimhacharyar SvAmi as his successor. Accordingly, that SvAmi took to ascetic order during Vikruti year, 27th of thai month, Friday (09 February 1951).
