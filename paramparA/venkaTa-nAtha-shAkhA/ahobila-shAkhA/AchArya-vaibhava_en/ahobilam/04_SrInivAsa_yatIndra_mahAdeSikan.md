This Azhagiyasingar was born in Marghazhi month, when ChitrA nakshatram was in ascendance. He ascended to the AsthAnam of SrI maTham in Krodhi year, thai month (January 1485).

From Srimushnam, he visited many divya deSams and arrived at the abhimAna sthalam of Singarkoyil celebrated by purANas. He stayed here for a few more days and conducted kAlakshepams on the various ubhaya VedAnta granthams to SishyAs. Then from there, this Yati went on a sancAram to visit northern divya deSams of Ahobilam, Dwaraka, Gokulam, BrundAvanam, MathurA, MayApuri, Avanti, Ayodhya etc. Then he went to Kanchipuram and returned back to Singarkoyil.

Here at Singarkoyil, he fell ill. One night, he had a worry about his successor to perform ArAdhanam for Malolan. He was wondering as to whom Malolan has in His mind to select as the successor for the AsthAnam. Thinking like this he slept. That night he had a dream. SrI Malolan appeared in his dream and asked his ArAdhakar not to worry and that the new ArAdhakar SvAmi to adorn the AsthAnam is on his way. During the same night, Maloan appeared in the dream of the next would be fifth paTTam Azhagiyasingar and invited him to perform ArAdhanam for Him. Next morning, this SvAmi shared his dream with his dear ones. They said that SvAmi is the object of Malolan and recipient of His paramAnugraham and that he should travel to Singarkoyil as per the direction of the Lord.

The SvAmi was very pleased with the niyamanam of Malolan. He completed his daily rituals and started on his way to Singarkoyil.

There, he prostrated before SrI Azhagiyasingar (3rd paTTam). They both exchanged information about their dreams. They were wonderstruck at the divine will of BhagavAn. Afterwards, the upadeSam was given on presha mantram to enter in to sanyASramam. He was given the ASrama tirunAmam of sarvatantra svatantra SaThakopa MahAdeSikan.
