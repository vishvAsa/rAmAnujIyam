This Azhagiyasingar was born in the agrahAram of AttippaTTu near Thiruvallur. He was born in his maternal grandfather's house in SrImukha year, Kartikai month when Uttirada Nakshatram was in ascendance (Novmber 1813).

His father and grand father belonged to Injimedu and were linked to the mADabhUshi vamSam. Since this future Azhagiyasingar grew up in his maternal grandfather's house at AttipaTTu, he was hailed as AttipaTTu Azhagiyasingar later. SrImad Injimettu Azhagiyasingar in the Mangala Slokam of his sArabodiini, a commentary on SrImad Rahasyatraya sAram said that 34th paTTam Azhagiyasingar belonged to his vamSam with the salutation "madIyakulanAtham"

स्तुतिपुलकाङ्कितगात्रं नृहरेर्बाष्पाम्बुना लसनेत्रम् ।।
वन्दे शठरिपुरामावरजमिनिन्द्रं मदीयकुलनाथम् ॥

stutipuLakAnkitagAtram nruharer bAshpAmbunA lasanetram | vande SaTharipurAmAvarajaminindram madIyakulanAtham ||

The pUrvASrama tirunAmam for this Azhagiyasingar was SrI u. vE. VidvAn mADabhUshi Srinivasacharya SvAmi.

On the command of the 33rd paTTam Azhagiyasingar, SrI SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan, this SvAmi accepted sanyAsASramam. He ascended to Sri maTham AsthAnam in the year PramAdi, month of AvaNi 29th, Krshna paksha ekAdaSI tithi, Friday, an auspicious day (12th September 1879). At that time, he was sixty one years old.

This Azhagiyasingar was in advanced age. He excelled in SAstra j~nAnam, exemplary conduct and as one who possessed all auspicious guNams. He was also a ParamaikAnti (one who is devoted only to Perumal and who does not need anything from Him except doing kaimkaryam to the Lord). He had learnt all the four Vedas. Hence, he was referred to as "Rishi SvAmi".

[[283]] SrImad Azhagiyasingar has blessed us with many granthams. They are:

1. SrInrusimhashashTi pAdavarNanam 2. Commentary for adhikaraNasArAvaLi, padayojanA 3. Commentary for nyAsavimSati 4. sAmAnyaviSeshAdi nyAyasangraham 5.

13. Vedagiri varNanam, turagati 14. Tamil tiruevvuL vAimozhi 15. SrIlakshmInrusimhan aDaikkalapattu 16. KimgruheSastuti

Studying these granthams will fill one with joy which will spread over the two banks of a river. It will make us not hesitant to speak about them in the spirit of "ஓரொன்று தானே அமையாதோ OronRu tAnE amaiyAto".

The grantham of SrI LakshmInrusimhan aDaikkalapattu created by this Azhagiyasingar is recited at SrI sannidhi and the houses of the SrI sannidhi SishyAs during sevA kAlam at the end. The last two pAsurams of this is also recited during sARRumuRai.

He has also examined SrImad Ramayanam, SrImad Rahasyatraya sAram, stotra pATha-s of SvAmi DeSikan and SrI sannidhi guruparamparA of SrI sampradAya muktAvaLi and got printed them.

[[284]] SrImad Azhagiyasingar was compassionate towards to all and omniscient. He had the saubhAgyam of direct visualization (sAkshAtkAram) of Lord Narasimhan. Our elders used to speak with wonder and reverence towards this Azhagiyasingar. Let us describe one or two of such instances.

In his pUrvAsramam, this SvAmi was residing permanently at PuNyAvarta Kshetram of Thiruvallur. Here, he was performing MangaLASAsanam of the divya dampatis. He used to be going to AttippaTTu often. At one time, he was returning from AttippaTTu and was on his way to Thiruvallur. In the middle of the way, he saw a herd of cows and bulls were moving on the same path. The cowherds (gopAlakAs) were following the cattle. The jIyar also was following them. He recalled the anubhavam of gopikAs enjoying Lord Krishna as a cowherd amidst them ("अटति यद्भवानह्नि काननं त्रुटि युगायते aTati yat bhavAn agni kAnanam truDiryugAyate" - SrImad BhAgvatam, 10.31.15). The herd of cows stood still and let him pass and gazed at SvAmi with reverence. They seem to understand SvAmi's vaibhavam as a Parama VaishNava described by the PurANam and gave way for the Azhagiyasingar --

ये कण्ठलग्नतुलसीनलिनाक्षमालाः ये बाहुमूलपरिचिह्नतशङ्खचक्राः। ये वा ललाटेफलके लसदूर्ध्वपुण्ड्र ते वैष्णवा भुवनमाशु पवित्रयन्ति॥

ye kaNThalagnatuLasInaLina akshamAlAH ye bAhumUlaparicihnataSankhacakrAH | ye vA lalATephalake lasadUdhrvapuNDra te vaishNavA bhuvanamASu pavitrayanti ||

SvAmi had the shining twelve Urdhva PuNDrams, tuLasI maNimAlai (tuLaSI seeds) garland and tAmarai maNimAlai (lotus seeds) garlands, hanging from his shoulder, a special container made up of bamboo (tiruppuRkUDai) and in it his arcA vigraham used in his ArAdhanam and a vessel filled with water in his hand. Those who saw [[285]] him with all these VaishNava lakshaNams wondered whether the PurANam described thus the SvAmi as a Parama VaishNava.

Amongst the cowherd, there was a rude one. He loudly said, "This pAppAn (Brahmin) comes frequently to our village. When they see him, our cows and bulls step away. What is so special about him? I will teach him a lesson one day".

His fellow cowherds rebuked him, "hey! why do you talk ill of the SvAmi? He does not do anything adverse towards us. He is not chasing away the cattle. He is going on his own way. It is a sin to criticize him".

The rude cowherd said, "You all can fall at the feet of that Brahmin (pAppAn). Why should he travel to the village, when we are herding our cattle? One day he was going like this. If the cattle give way, he can pass through in the middle. But that was not so. He went around them. If the cattle see him they go hither and thither. Why does he come this way? Today I will teach him a lesson so that he does not come this way again. You will all see". He hit a strong bull a few times and made it to rush against the Azhagiyasingar so as to harm him. He also hit the other cattle and made them to run.

Our SvAmi meditating on BhagavAn goes in front of the cattle. He was not aware of the conversation between the cowherds behind him. The bull and the cows rushing down did not go anywhere near the SvAmi and went away a little far off and did not harm the compassionate SvAmi. Now, the other boys clapping their hands laughed at the rude boy.

The boy who chased the bull to rush at the SvAmi not able to bear this ridicule, got even angrier. He said very proudly to the other boys, "All of you now see my clever tactics". Saying thus, he went forward and stood in front of the SvAmi. He addressed the SvAmi sarcastically, "Oh ayyarE (BrahmaNA)!"

SvAmi responded with a smile and asked the boy as to what he wants. He answered, "What can I have from you. Do you have any snacks for me in the bag hanging from your shoulder? That is ok, let it be! Why are you coming on our way? If you keep on coming like this in our way, your reputation will get ruined. Do not tell me that I did not warn You". [[286]] SvAmi responded, saying, "What harm I did to you? I was going on my own way, meditating on Narayanan with out talking to anyone. Why do you hate me?"

The other boys told SvAmi, " SvAmi! He is going to face bad time. That is why he is talking like this with out any sense. Please ignore him and go away".

The angry boy retorted, saying, "If you are going without affecting any one, how come the cattle calm down and yield the path to you? You must be using some mantram to control them. Tomorrow, you might use another mantram and drive the cattle to your own home! You may say the cattle follow me on their own way and what you can do about it".

On hearing this, SvAmi smilingly told him, "I did not use any mantrams or magic. The cattle seem to be fond of me".

The boy was getting madder by the minute and said, "Oh SvAmi! Do you think I am an idiot. Don't try to cheat me. If you talk like this, your reputations will get ruined".

SvAmi replied, "Why are you foolish? I am going my own way without disturbing anyone. Do not use abusive words. May BhagavAn give you a good buddhi!"

The boy got angrier now. He told the SvAmi, "You are telling me that I have no good buddhi. See what I am going to, I am not going to leave." Saying thus, he stopped the cattle and hit them to run. He hit badly a strong bad bull making it to run close to SvAmi with the intention of harming him. The bull ignored and went around SvAmi without harming him. Now the bull ran at a great speed at the boy, and chased him. He was running here and there to escape from the bull but got stuck in muddy ground and was tired. The bull pushed the boy on to the ground with his horns, bleated loud and joined the other cattle.

The cowherds addressed the misbehaving boy and said, "Oh fool! We warned earlier that SvAmi is like God. He did not interfere in our activities. He was just reciting Vedas. We told you not to go near him. Even our cattle revere him by not chewing the grass in their mouth. The bull you provoked to attack him refused to do so and went in the pradakshaNam manner around him. It gored you and calmly returned to the group. The intelligence, the cattle have is superior to that of [[287]] you. We have now seen in action the proverb, the one who is going to be destroyed will think of bad things (keDuvAn kEDu ninaippAn)". They went to the side of the arrogant comrade who was lying on the ground.

SvAmi also felt bad. He said to himself, "This danger came about because of me. If I had not come this way, he would not have been exposed to this danger. The wise ones accept others' mistakes and attribute them to themselves. Andal did upadeSam through a lady with sAtvika guNam, "nAnE tAn AyiDuka" (May the mistakes be linked to me)". SvAmi blaming himself for this calamity and went to the place where the boy fell down.

On seeing the SvAmi, they stepped aside. SvAmi sprinkled some water on the face of face of the boy, who fainted. The boy opened his eyes and saw the SvAmi standing in front of him. He folded his hands. He could not speak. He cried and wept.

SvAmi blessed the boy and said, Oh boy! Do not harm the speechless ones. Be kind to the animals. If you do so, they will be kind to you. There is no use in talking about what has happened, Even now, conduct yourself with compassion. Do not be afraid! You have survived now. BhagavAn has saved you". SvAmi named a medicinal herb and asked the boys to fetch it, grind it in to a paste and to apply over the wounds. After some time the boy got up and sought SvAmi's pardon with folded hands. SvAmi blessed him saying. "Be safe and go".

The learned scholars, who heard this incident were reminded about the Slokam --

न चलति निजवर्णधर्मतो यः सममतिरात्मसुहृद्विपक्षपक्षे। न हरति न च हन्ति किञ्चिदुच्चैः सितमनसं तमवेहि विष्णुभक्तम् ॥

na calati nijavarNadharmato yaH samamatitAtmasuhrdvipakshapakshe | na harati na ca hanti kinciduccaiH sitamanasam tamavehi vishnubhaktam || [[288]] SvAmi is a sarva lakshaNa sampUrNar as cited by this Slokam. SrIman Narayanan incarnates on this earth to give His darSanam - "paritrANAya sAdhUnAm vinASAya ca dushkrutAm" is the declaration by the gItAtAcAryan. He saved SvAmi from this threat to his life. The rishis of yore prayed to Raghavan, when asurAs were causing them harm. SvAmi prayed to SrI Veeraraghavan to save the boy who troubled him much. He was saved from the danger. What we learn from this incident is that the SvAmi's vaibhavam is loftier and praiseworthy (mahanIya) than those of the rishis. As the Slokam states, SvAmi never slipped from observing varNASrama dharmams. He had the same attitude towards those, who spoke ill about him as well as those who loved him. This means he had the same kindness towards the suhruds as the dveshis. He would not steal others' wealth even by his mind. He won't hit and trouble anybody. He always talks softly but never speaks loudly. He is a pure hearted one. How can BhagavAn forsake such a VishNu bhaktan?

We will now describe two other incidents that happened during his sanyAsa Asramam.

SrImad Azhagiyasingar has such a tapobalam (power due to his penace/austerities), he can know the mind and the wishes of SrI LakshmInrusimhan. Whenever, he is about to enter the sannidhi of Malolan to start abhigamana ArAdhanam, the jIyar will ask for permission to enter inside to remove the previous day flowers, sandalwood (tirukkAppu) etc. On some days, immediately after the removal of the tirukkAppu, MangalahAratti used to be performed. On some other days, he will say, "Oho! Is praNaya kalaham (divine love fight between the divya dampatis) going on? If that is so, I will come back after some time. Saying thus he will wait a little far off and then ask again Malolan as to whether he can come on His direction (niyamanam). After getting the Lord's permission, the tirukkkApu used to be removed. On some other days, the jIyar will be telling, "Seems You are still under the influence of enjoyment (bhoga mayakkam) which is yet to be over. aDiyEn will come after some time".

Those who have seen and heard about these incidents used to say that SrI Azhagiyasingar had these anubhavams. But they will raise doubts as to how it can be taken that Azhagiyasingar could know the mind and wishes of SrI LakshmInrusimhan. The facts are being told hereunder. The readers can judge themselves.

During the period of this Azhagiyasingar, one day for the abhigamana ArAdhanam, huge quantity of sweet pongal (sakkarai pongal) was [[289]] prepared in ten vessels. They were all transferred to a big vessel and was taken to the sannidhi for nivedanam. After the nivedanam, SrI LakshmInrusimhan blessed by taking only dadhyannam (curd rice) but not sakkarai pongal. The Lord said that there is a piece of hair (keSam from the head). Immediately the pongal was transferred to another vessel. A piece of hair was found at the bottom of the vessel.

One day, the sannidhi ArAdhakar, after ijjyArAdhanam (ArAdhanam during noon) did the nivedanam of annam etc. As usual, the ArAdhakar then prayed to SrI Azhagiyasingar for performing the mangalahAratti to Perumal. Azhagiyasingar went inside behind the curtain. Within one or two seconds, he called the ArAdhakar and said that Perumal has not taken lentils (Paruppu) as it is having small stones. On examining immediately, it was found that the lentils were given for cooking without cleaning to remove the stones.

SrI Azhagiyasingar stayed permanently at Thiruvallur during pUrvASramam as well after sanyASramam. He did not go on sancAram due to his advanced age and failing health. Azhagiyasingar had abundant and unwavering bhakti to SrI Veeraraghavan also like to SrI LakshmInrusimhan. He presented many AbhAraNams to SrI Veeraraghavan. In addition, he presented Golden palanquin and tiruthEr from the fund presented at his holy feet by the SishyAs. Azhagiyasingar used to call fondly SrI LakshmInrusimhan as "MahA SvAmi" and SrI Veeraraghavan as "mAsvAmi". He used to say thus in double entendre (Slesha) - "mA" meaning mine (ennuDaiya); during the New Moon days (amAvAsya) the lord takes the "mA" (tinai) presented by the bhaktAs and so "mAsvAmi" (tinai mA/tinai mAvu - flour made from a kind of millet/grain and mixed with jaggery). Even today, the kaimkaryams for SrI Veeraraghavan sannidhi continued to be done per the procedures laid out by this Azhagiyasingar in the same way that SrI BhAshyakArar has laid out the kramam/methods for the sannidhi of Sri Ranganathan. kaTTiyam, eccarikai, anugraham (கட்டியம், எச்சரிக்கை, அனுக்ரஹம்) which were created by the Azhagiyasingar are being recited in SrI Veeraraghavan sannidhi.

PiLLaipAkkam SrI Azhagiyasingar and 41st paTTam SrI Azhagiyasingar were the SishyAs of this Azhagiyasingar. About this Azhagiyasingar, PiLLaipAkkam Sri Azhagiyasingar created a grantham, "AcAryasaptati" and the 41st paTTam SrI Azhagiyasingar composed "SrImahAsvAmigadyam".

The style (vaikari) of performing kAlakshepam by this Azhagiyasingar is easy to understand and with other commonly used words (style of [[290]] anitara sAdhAraNam). In the midst of the kAlakshepam. Azhagiyasingar would say, "ajAmitvAya kinciducyate" - to get rid of laziness (as per present day saying, not to get bored), will tell you a story. Listen". Like this He used to say every day many such stories things (aitikyams).

When SrImad Azhagiyasingar was thus very famous. his health deteriorated. He ascended to Paramapadam in the year CitrabhAnu, Purattasi 21st, Krshna paksha daSami tithi, Thursday (5th October 1882).

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 3 years, 1 month
