The avataAram of this Azhagiyasingar took place in an agrahAram, PonviLainda Kalattur (near Chengalpattu) in the month of VaikASi when the jyeshThA (KeTTai) nakshatram was in ascendance. He belonged to BhAradwAja Gotram (Vangeepuram). His pUrvaSrama tirunAmam was SrI. u. vE. VidvAn Narasimhacharya SvAmi. It was known that during the nirvAka kAlam of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar, this SvAmi was doing the SrI kArya kaimkaryam (administrative duties) of the SrI sannidhi. On the niyamanam (command) of SrI SaThakopa Ramanuja yatIndra mahAdeSikan (34th paTTam), this SvAmi took to ascetic order. He ascended to the simhAsanam of the SrI sannidhi in the year CitrabhAnu, Purattasi month, Krshna paksha sashTi tithi, Tuesday (October 3, 1822), when the Rohini nakshatram was in ascendance.

This Azhagiyasingar was an acknowledged expert in tarka SAstram. He used to render discourses on SrI BhAshyam in a delectable manner.

He stayed at Thiruvallur for a long time and was performing kaimkaryams of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar. Later on, at the request by his disciples, he went to Tirumalai and did MangaLASAsanam of Thiruvengadamudaiyan. The Mahant, the administrator of Tirumalai devasthanam being an extremely devoted to SrI Azhagiyasingar, fulfilled his commands. SrI Azhagiyasingar stayed at Tirumalai for a few days and was worshipping the Lord, Srinivasan. Later, he took leave of Perumal and offered MangalASAsanam of Govindarajan and Alarmelmanga tAyAr and returned to Thiruvallur.

After a few days, he started on his sancAram to offer MangaLASAsanam at Thiruninravoor, Thiruvallikeni, Sriperumbudur, and Kanchipuram Perumal Koyil besides offering worship of SvAmi DeSikan at tUpul. He visited several of the agrahArams in Kanchipuram region and later returned to Thiruvallur.

[[292]] During the time of this Azhagiyasingar, several renovations were done at Thiruvallur SrI Veeraraghavan sannidhi and the consecration of SrI Veeraraghavan. During the samprokshanam period with the help of the Mahant of Tirumala devasthanam, SrI Azhagiyasingar spent several lakhs of money for the renovation work. On the concluding day, SrI Azhagiyasingar was standing at the Temple entrance and was offering handful of money to each of those who attended the function. This Azhagiyasingar was complimented as a very enthusiastic philanthropist.

Once a mahAn showering praise on the kind hearted nature of SrI Azhagiayasingar, said, "What we (Azhagiyasingar) are giving? We are ashamed of what is being given. What is now being given with handful of money may be just about thirty rupees. With this money, bhAgavatAs may be able to perform bhagavadArAdhnam for a couple of months only. What will they do afterwards? If only a big winnow (muRam) with full of money is given to them their generation will be happily taken care of. But we are not able to do so".

He used to give away the money received on each day to the many SvAmis who visit SrI sannidhi. He would not prefer to keep the money in the box and lock it. On days when there are no outside visitors, he used to give the money received to the Kaimkaryaparargal such as SrI kAryam and others in the sannidhi. On one occasion there was no collection of money and there was only one and quarter anA coin (just a fraction of one Rupee) in the box. He called the SrI kAryam SvAmi and asked him to take it. SrI kAryam SvAmi firmly said that the box should not be empty and as such cannot be taken. SrI Azhagiyasingar told SrI kAryam SvAmi that his inability to give anything to anybody is very disturbing to his mind and so compeled the SrI kAryam to take it. Accordingly, SrI kAryam SvAmi took the coin and scratched it on the floor and told Azhagiyasingar that this coin has no more value and invalid. As such an invalid coin should not be given as dAnam. He kept back the coin in the box. It was said that during the last days of SrI Azhagiyasingar that coin only remained in the box.

If someone comes and asks SrI Azhagiyasingar for money to perform ceremony (SrAddham), he used to ask them as to whether he wants to perform as a SrAddham or as tiruvadhyayanam. If that person is not able to provide an answer, Azhagiyasingar used to ask him, "Are you going to perform srAddham by inviting three SvAmis (nimantraNa SvAmis) or you are going to have an elaborate sARRumurai with Veda and Prabandha recital?" Depending upon their choice and need, he will give money accordingly and send them. When they are about to leave, [[293]] he used to call them back again and ask them, "How will you be able to manage the next day following the srAddham? Do you think this money is enough for the SrAddham?" He used to give him some more money about ten to fifteen rupees. He was such a great philanthropist.

Injimettu Sri Azhagiyasingar, MahA VidvAn Thirukottiyur SvAmi and MahA VidvAn Puttankottam SvAmi had samASrayaNam from this Azhagiyasingar. This spoke volumes about the glory of the mantra upadeSams of this Azhagiyasingar. It was known that Pillaipakkam Azhagiyasingar performed the SrI kArya kaimkaryam under this Azhagiyasingar.

This Azhagiyasingar ascended to Paramapadam at Thiruvallur in the year SarvadhAri, Adi month (28th) Friday, Sukla caturti, pUrvapalguni nakshatram (10th August 1888).

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 5 years, 10 months
