This Azhagiyasingar belonging to VeeravalliyAr vamSam was born at Tiruvallur on Purattasi month, ASleshA nakshatram. He ascended to Ahobila maTha AsthAnam on PramAdISa year, thai month (January 1734) Sukla paksha ekAdaSi tithi.

This Azhagiyasingar went on sancAram from Thirupputkkuzhi to Kanchipuram and performed his MangaLASAsanam to PeraruLALan and Perumdevi tAyar. From there, he proceeded to Srirangam and on the way, performed MangaLASAsanams to many divya deSa EmperumAns. On arrival at Srirangam after his bath in the River Cauvery and completing his rituals went to the Srirangam temple and performed his MangaLASAsanams for the divya dampatis. Then he went to the daSAvatAra sannidhi. He stayed permanently at daSAvatAra sannidhi and was doing his daily ArAdhanam. There, he was performing kAlakshepams on SrI Bhashyam and other granthams. Koyil Kandatai ANNan SvAmi sought the refuge of SrI Azhagiyasingar and was undergoing kAlakshepams of Azhagiyasingar. During this time, one day Azhagiyasingar said that this daSAvatAra sannidhi is quite comfortable and fit to live (vAsayogyam). On hearing this, Kandatai SvAmi said, "The daSAvatAra sannidhi was entrusted to our ancestors by Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan for ArAdhanam and administration. Our family took good care of the sannidhi until now. [[243]] This sannidhi truly belongs to Ahobila maTham. SrImad Azhagiyasingar should take possession of this sannidhi from here on". ANNan SvAmi presented the deeds (mAnyam) for the sannidhi and the Nandavanam linked to the property. He handed over the property to SrImad Azhagiyasingar.

In the Silver maNTapam in Malolan sannidhi, there is a silver arcA mUrti of SrI Ranganathan. It was said that this divine and auspicious arcA has been worshipped by SrI ANNan SvAmi or by his ancestors. That vigraham was also handed over to SrI maTham. This arcA mUrti is even now being worshipped in this Silver maNTapam by SrImad Azhagiyasingars.

A few years ago, a Golden MaNTapam as well golden SimhAsanam were presented by SrI maTham by the SishyAs of SrI maTham during the AsthAnam of 45th paTTam, Sri Villivalam Azhagiyasingar.

This Azhagiyasingar ascended from the daSAvatAra sannidhi to SrI VaikuNTham in Raakshasa year, Adi month (July 1735), Krishna paksha ekAdaSI tithi.
