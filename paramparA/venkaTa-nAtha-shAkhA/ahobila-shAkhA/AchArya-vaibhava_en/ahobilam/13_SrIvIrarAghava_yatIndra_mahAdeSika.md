This Azhagiyasingar was born at Thiruvallur. His tirunakshatram is Ani, Utthiradam. He belonged to Vangeepuram BhAradwaja gotram. He entered the sanyAsa ASramam at Tirunarayanapuram in the year, AngIrasa, Purattasi month (September 1632), Krishna Pancami tithi. He arrived at Tirumalirumcholai (Azhagar Koyil) after sancAram from Tirunarayanapuram to Srirangam and had MangaLASAsanams at divya deSams on the way. He stayed at Tirumalirumcholai for an extended period. From here, he proceeded to Azhwar Tirunagari. He worshipped AdippirAn and SvAmi NammAzhvAr. The honors (MaryAdais) to the jIyar at AzhvAr sannidhi were similar to the same as for Adi vaN SaThakopa jIyar with appropriate aruLappADu. Azhagiyasingar accepted all the sannidhi honors with enthusiasm and returned to his maTham. The temple kaimkaryaparars took leave of Azhagiyasingar and returned back to the temple.

Next day, after abhigamana ArAdhanam, the local VaishNavAs prostrated before Azhagiyasingar and prayed for the anugraham of a kAlakshepam on Bhagavad vishaya granthams. Azhagiyasingar listened to the prayerful request but did not respond. That night when he was sleeping, SvAmi NammAzhvAr appeared in his dream and commanded him to bless the local VaishNava community with the kAlakshepam which they requested. Azhagiyasingar woke up and reflected happily over the command of SvAmi NammAzhvAr.

[[235]] Next day morning after finishing his daily rituals, Azhagiyasingar performed the abhighamana ArAdhanam. Then he informed the local VaishNavAs about the blessed dream and his desire to start the kAlakshepam right away. SishyAs blew their trumpets and took the Azhagiyasingar to AzhvAr sannidhi. Many participated in the kAlakshepams and paid their regards in the traditional manner. The kAlakshepams took a whole year to be completed. After the concluding sessions (sARRumuRai), Azhagiyasingar proceeded on sancAram to Srivilliputthur and Tiruppullanii and other divya deSams and then to northern region. From Ahobilam, Azhagiyasingar returned to Srirangam and stayed there.

During his stay in Srirangam, he ascended to Paramapadam on a Nala samvatsaram, aippasi month (October 1676) Krishna paksha shashTi dinam.
