The avatAram of this Azhagiyasingar took place in the agrahAram of Karukkuricchi on the banks of Thamrabarani River in the year Ananda, Margazhi month (December 1854) when the Poorattadi nakshatram was in ascendance. He belonged to vAdhUa gotram. His pUrvASrama tirunAmam was SrI. u. vE. VidvAn taTTai Gopala RamabhadrchAryar. Taking to ascetic order in the year dundubhi, 4th day of thai month (17 January 1923) he ascended to the AsthAnam. Of all those Azhagiyasingars before him, he was the oldest to head the AsthAnam. Despite his old age, he was performing all the nityakarmAnushThanam with high priority and reverence. He conducted discourses at frequent intervals for the entire duration of his nirvAkam as the head of the AsthAnam. Besides the discourses on grantha catushTyam, he rendered kAlakshepam on SatadUshaNI, [[333]] nyayasiddhAnjanam and other granthams amidst the gathering of learned scholars of repute. He did his sancAram in the south from Thuvariman to Setu (Thirupullani) and in the north up to Tiruppati. He stayed permanently at daSAvatAra sannidhi in Srirangam.

The granthams authored by this Azhagiyasingar are:

1. SrIlakshmInrsimha dhyAnasopAnam 2. SrI VedapAdASItistavam 3. daSAvatAra vedapAdastavam 4. nityaprArthanAkArikAvaLi 5. acAryadinacaryA 6. SrImahAsvAmi gadyam (about SrI AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar).

Even though, this Azhagiyasingar did not take up extensive travel, he purchased lands worth two and half lakhs of Rupees received from the donations received by the SrI maTham. In present day value, this may sound a small amount. This needs to be understood based on the value of money in those days. An amount of nearly one lakh of rupees was spent to construct branch maThams at Tirumala, Thirupullani and Vaduvur.

As a reflection of his devotion to his AcAryas, he consecrated the divya mangala vigrahams of the 33rd and 34th paTTam Azhagiyasingars in the Silver maNTapam. The vigraham of 40th paTTam Azhagiyasingar was placed at the Holy feet of SrI Adi vaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan and his own vigraham at the Holy feet of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar. Thus, these were consecrated in this manner.

The divya mangala vigraham of AttippaTTu Azhagiaysingar was consecrated at the sannidhi of AdivaN SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan in Thiruvallur temple. His own vigraham was placed at the Holy feet of AttippaTTu Azhagiyasingar. He organised the process of the SaThAri honours from SrI Raghavan on the occasion of Pancaparva (occurring on two ekAdSI-s each month, Paurnami, first day of each Tamil month and amAvasya) festivals.

The SaThAri in the Silver MaNTapam was also renovated with gems by this Azhagiyasingar.

[[334]] Due to persistent health issues, this Azhagiyasingar initiated Injimedu mADabhUshi SrI. u. vE. VidvAn Ranganathachariyar into sanyAsa ASramam and gave the tirunAmam as "SrIranga SaThakopa yatIndra mahAdeSikan".

Later this Azhagiyasingar's health improved. Both the Azhagiyasingars together were performing ArAdhanam to SrI LakshmInrusimhan for thirteen years. 41st paTTam Azhagiyasingar attained Paramapadam in the year Vishu, month of aiyppasi, Sukla pancami tithi (October 1941).

His Brundavanam was built in front of the daSAvatAra sannidhi in Srirangam.

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 18 years, 10 months
