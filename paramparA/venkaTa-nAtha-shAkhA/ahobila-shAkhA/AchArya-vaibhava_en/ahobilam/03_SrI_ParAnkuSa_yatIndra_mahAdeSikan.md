This Azhagiyasingar is from Kanchipuram region and from MalayAnkuLam agrahAram. He was born in the month of thai, when SravaNa Nakshatram was in ascendance. His pUrvASrama tirunAmam was Kantadai KrishnayajvA. From this name, we could infer that he has conducted yAgAs.

He ascended the SrI maTham ASthAnam in Nandana year, Panguni month, (March 1473), PaurNami tithi.

This Yati went on sancAram from Tirunarayanapuram to Perumal Koyil (Kanchipuram). He performed MangaLASAsanam to Perumdevi tAyAr and PeraruLAlan. He stayed at Kanchipuram for a few days. The scholars of this divya deSam sought the refuge at his sacred feet and attended kAlakshepam on SrI BhAshyam and other esoteric granthams.

This Yati established many Vaidika agrahArams like Neeralur, Uragadam, Nemmili, Kadankarai and PalApputtur.

He went on sancAram to Tirukkovilur, Tiruvaheendrapuram, Srimushnam etc., and to Srirangam. At Srirangam, he performed MangaLASAsanam of SrI Ranganayaki sameta SrI Ranganathan and conducted grantha kAlakshepams for those who sought him as their refuge. At that time, he had a great longing to worship SrI BhUvarAhan at Srimushnam again and he traveled to this abhimAna sthalam. He stayed there for a long time.

During this time, Azhagiyasingar fell ill and ascended to Paramapadam in the year Kurodhi, thai month, (January 1485), Krishna paksha Caturdasi. His BrundAvanam is at Srimushnam.

His AsthAna nirvAka kAlam - 11 years, 10 months
