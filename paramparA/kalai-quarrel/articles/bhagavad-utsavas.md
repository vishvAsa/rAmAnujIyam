> Yathokthakari temple is kept shut early morning - when Varadan is coming through those streets during his brahmotsavam. It is not even a question of an acharya of one or the other sampradaya. Perumal himself is treated so based on the namam sported on his vahanam.

> Of course, ashtabhujam and yathokthakari perumals go to varadarajan madaveethi for brahmotsavam. Neither is the varadaraja door closed nor do the vdks of kanchi keep their doors shut. Rather u would see them pay due respects to perumals.

> Further comedy cum hypocrisy is this - this temple is managed by a local trustee and is not under govt HRCE. When recently samprokshanam was done, they did not have any problem in soliciting funds from vadakalais and the major contributor for the function was a vadakalai guy only as per locals of kanchi. So, it seems when it comes to money all these sampradaya fights melt away. But when it comes to perumal, namam is more important than perumal. So their hierarchy is perumal < namam < money. beautiful display of bhagavata dharma indeed.
