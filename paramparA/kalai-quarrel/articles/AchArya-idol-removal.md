### shrIvilliputtUr 1816

15\. In the year 1816, the Thenkalais interfered with the Vadakalais feeding Brahmins in the Vedanta Desikar shrine and even in this interference they were worstedvide Exhibits G1, XIV (b), G3, G2 and G4. These documents show that the Tenkalais even went so far as to spitting in the Desikar shrine so as to prevent completely the feast being given in it and that for this outrage they were tried and convicted by the Magistrate. In all these documents the Collector calls this shrine as belonging to the Vadakalais only.

16\. Finding all their attempts unavailing, the Thenkalais took the last step of destroying the Desikar idol itself.  
They broke into the shrine one night, broke the idol  
and carried it away  
and on this being done the Collector ordered that all the servants in the big temple who were Thenkalais should be dismissed from service-  
Exhibit G5, dated 1-2-1822.  
They then came to their senses  
and swore before their temple in the presence of the Thasildar  
that the mischief was not done by them  
and that they would never be privy to any such outrage.  
On the application of the Vadakalais, the idol was remade,  
mostly at the Government expense  
and partly by subscriptions raised by them  
and the shrine was also rebuilt strongly  
and the new idol made established in it for worship as before-  
Exhibits S and XV to XV (c).  
This was all over by May 1822, Vide Exhibit JJ.  
and in the following year plaintiff's predecessors applied to the Collector  
that the pa-tithram which was being given to the Desikar shrine for daily performance of the puja in it from the Nachiar temple should be ordered to be given to them as before-Exhibit F dated 4-1-1823.

## mahAmuni removal
महामुनि: निष्कासित इत्यत्र  
एकं स्थलं काञ्चीति कनिष्ठिकया गण्यते चेत् अनामिका सार्थवती पुनः बभूव

Throwing of mAmunigaL's Thirumeni into the periya puSkariNi in Kanchi before 19th century - supposedly not done by a tAtArya.

The idol was restored.  
Thence even an utsava for mahAmuni was instituted.
