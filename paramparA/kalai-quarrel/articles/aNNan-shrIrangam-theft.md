Annan swamy thirumaligai has several rights in srirangam temple including teertham. They claim to be koil kandadais and descendants of mudaliyandan. 

In the 18th century, the acharya swamy of that lineage stole golden arch and some other items from the temple. He was barred from temple for that theft by the nawab of arcot of all men. 

This shameful incident is recorded in the koil olugu chronicle as well - which is a tk one maintained by a caturtha who was also annan sishya incidentally.
