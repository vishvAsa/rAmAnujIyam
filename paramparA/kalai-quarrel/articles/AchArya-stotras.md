## kAnchI varadarAja
> As for reciting Desika stotras in Varadaraja temple, there are court orders which specifically state when these stotras must be recited. It is customary. Desika stotras are recited by vadakalais who walk the entire stretch to Pazhayaseevaram.
>
> Otoh, tenkalais wilfully try to spoil the end of the ghoshti by reciting other stotras - which has no customary basis. The laziness of Kanchi tenkalais is also well known. Tenkalais don't seem to not have enough devotion to actually do such labor. They will only come at the final point by to create ruckus.
