### Note

A number of sannads written on old paper and belonging mostly to the 18th and 19th century were found in the possession of the Parakāla Maṭṭ at Mysore. They were obtained on loan by the kind permission of the present Head of the Matt and have been copied and edited in this report.


[[114]]

The sannad which is noticed here is the earliest of them and belongs to the reign of Kaṇṭhīrava Narasarāja Voḍeyar but it does not refer to the Parakāla Maṭṭ.  

The first sannad that refers to the Parakāla Maṭṭ belongs to the time of Hyder Ali and is dated in the year Chitrabhānu sam. Mārgaśira śu. 14 which probably corresponds to November 30, 1762 A.D. Next comes the sannad of the Bēlūr Chief, Krishnappa Nāyaka Ś 1696 Jaya sam. Phāl śu. 15 corresponding to 17th March 1775 A. D. It records the gift of a village to Rāmānuja Parakālasvāmi.

### Note

This nirup was issued by Navaba Tipu Sultan Bahadaravaru. It has a seal above in Persian characters with the name Tipu Sultan and the date 1186. But the reading of the date however is doubtful and the details of dating according to Hindu system given in line 2 of the record, Sobhakṛit sam. Bhadrapada ba 5 would correspond to 15th September 1783 A. D. the only year Śōbhakṛit occurring in the reign of Tipu Sultan corresponding to 1783.

The nirūp is addressed to Kuppaiya, dēvasthānada-sīme-pārupatyagār or manager of the department of temples in the State  
and relates to the system of reciting invocatory verses in the temple at Mēlukōṭe (See number 15).  

It is stated in this nirūp that Anche Śamaiya (an officer under Tipu) was violating the old usage in the temple at Mēlukōṭe regarding the use of invocatory verses  
and it was now ordained that both forms of invocation which begin with Rāmānuja-dayāpātra and Śrīśaila-dayāpātra might be used. 

Further the pārupatyagār was ordered to be fair to both the sects of Vaḍagalai and Tenkalai (which used the above invocations) and to remove the image of Piḷḷai Lōkāchār (a saint of the Tenkalai sect) to its original place at Mēlukōṭe 
and to take the god in procession to Kēśavasvāmi maṇṭapa and other maṇṭapas  
and distribute tīrtha (sacred water) and prasāda (consecrated food offered to god) during the time of Tirunakshatra and conduct the services with zeal in the usual manner.

Directions are next given that a copy of the nirūp should be preserved in the register of the accountant (śānabhōga) and the nirūp itself should be preserved in the maṭṭ of the Parakāla Jīyar (head of the Parakāla Maṭṭ).

It is interesting to note that while a previous sannad issued in the reign of Kaṇṭhīrava Narasarāja Voḍeyar lays down the rule that only the Vaḍagalai invocation (beginning with Rāmānuja-dayāpātram) should be used in temples the present sannad orders the use of invocations of both the Vaḍagalai and Tenkalai sects and that both the sannads claim old usage for the invocations laid down in them.+++(5)+++ 

The Tenkalai school uses the following invocatory verse during the recita- tion and study of Prabandhas :—

Śrīśailēśa-dayāpātram dhibhaktyādi-guṇārṇavam yatīndra-praṇavam vande Ramyajāmātaram munim. 

This verse is said to have been miraculously revealed by God to the disciples of Maṇavāḷa-mahāmuni while they were engaged in the study of the Prabandhas under their guru.
