> The 44th Srimath Azhagiyasingar (adiyen’s Aachaarya) - Even though Bhagavaan Sri RanganaaTha Himself Asked for it and His Holiness duly completed the construction of Sri-Rangam Raaja-Gopuram, His Holiness Did-Not go inside the Temple to have Sri RanganaaTha dharSanam - all because of one and only one reason - where there is NO respect for Swaamy Sri Vedhaantha-DeSika, HH didn’t consider that Temple as good enough even to offer worship to that Bhagavaan at such a place -

> Even on the day of Raaja-Gopuram SamprokshaNam, HH stayed only at Swaamy Sri DeSika SanniDhi and did not go inside to worship Sri RanganaaTha (adiyen was there on that day - just about 12 inches next to HH) - of course - the so called custodians of Sri RanganaaTha Temple of Sri-Rangam did not allow HH to do the SamprokshaNam, even though HH took unimaginable pains to complete the Raaja-Gopuram construction - adiyen still remembers the most unholy comment they made  - “indha keLavanai+++(=वृद्धम्)+++ ambadhadikku uLLa vida kuudaadhu” - (very sorry for my not-so-chaste Tamil) -
