[[2]]



2. The petitioner states that he belongs to Thengalai Sect  Srivaishnavite and a regular worshipper of Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple at  Kanchipuram. The Thengalai Sect Srivaishnavites have a right to recite  Tamil Divyaprabhandam Poetic verses in the said temple during festival and  other days. The petitioner is the permanent resident of Kanchipuram having  Miras rights in the temple, besides being a regular worshipper. The petitioner  being a devotee of Lord Sri Devaraja Swamy, filed a petition before the  Commissioner, HR & CE Department questioning the Sathumurai Festival  performed to Sri Thatha Desigan in Arulmigu Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple.
   The Commissioner, HR & CE Department adjudicated the issues with  reference to custom, practice and usage and rejected the claim of the  petitioner as devoid of merits by confirming the earlier order passed by the  the then Commissioner of HR & CE Department in R.P.No.84 of 2003,
   R.P.No.257 of 2005 and RC.No.69511 of 2006. The Commissioner has  declined to adjudicate the views earlier adopted by his predecessors, in the  matter of Sathumurai Festival to Sri Thatha Desigan. Thus, the present writ  petition came to be instituted.
   [[3]]    
3. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the writ  petitioner would submit that the temple Management/Authorities are bound  to implement the order dated 03.02.1942 passed in O.A.No.332 of 1941. The  said order was reiterated in A.S.No.147 of 1946 on the file of the Subordinate Court at Chengalpet which was reiterated in R.C.No. 69511 of 2006  dated 13.04.2007. Thus, the spirit of the Order of the Court is to be followed  for the purpose of Sathumurai Festival to Sri Thatha Desigan. In practice, the  dictum of the Court is violated by the Vadagalai Sect, to their advantage at  the temple, which prompted the petitioner to move the present writ petition.
4. When custom and usage is not in force nor recognised by the  Court in O.A.No.332 of 1941, a new procedures set up by the Thathacharyars  Sect for performing the Sathumurai festival to Sri Thatha Desigan is directly  in violation of the dictum of the Commissioner in O.A.No.332 of 1941 dated
   03.02.1942.
5. The learned Senior Counsel would further submit that there is no  materials on record available to establish such procedures were being  followed earlier, as performed now by Thathachariyar Sect in Arulmigu Sri  [[4]]      Devaraja Swamy Temple. Therefore, the order of the Commissioner is  running counter to the custom and usage as determined by the Commissioner  in O.A.No.332 of 1941 and in A.S.No.147 of 1946 and consequently, the  order is to be set aside.
6. Mr.T.Ramesh, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the 3rd  respondent/Sri Thatha Desiga Thiruvamsathar Sabha representing  Thathacharyars sect contented that the dictum in O.A.No.332 of 1941 is  inapplicable in respect of performance of Sathumurai festival to Sri Thatha  Desigan in Arulmigu Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple. Therefore, the petitioner  is attempting to misinterpret the scope of the order passed by the  Commissioner in O.A.No.332 of 1941. The list of Alwars and Achariars  stated in the order would reveal that Sri Thatha Desigan was not included in  the list of Alwars and Achariars. Therefore, the question of nonimplementation of the order of the Commissioner in O.A.No.332 of 1941  would not arise at all.
7. The learned Counsel for the 3  rd  respondent would further submit  that the festival to Thatha Desigan is mainly celebrated on Karthigai  [[5]]      Anusham for a single day to celebrate his birthday. There is no idol/Uthsava  moorthy of Sri Thatha Desigan in the festival. Thus, the Sathumurai Festival  to Sri Thatha Desigan being celebrated by Thathacharyars Sect for past more  than 300 years is not falling within the ambit of the order passed by the  Commissioner in O.A.No.332 of 1941.
8. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2  nd  respondent/Arulmigu Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple made a submission that  the performance of various festivals at Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple  including Sathumurai Festival for various Alwars and Achariars by both the  sects are being celebrated as per the custom and practice prevailing in the  temple.
9. Unlike other Alwars and acharyars in the temple, there is no  Uthsava Vigraham for Shri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desigan. All other  Alwars and Acharyars for whom Sathumurai is performed on the earlier  birthday celebration have Uthsava Moorthy/Vigraham (statue) taken in  procession along with Perumal after conclusion of Sathumurai. As there is no  Uthsava Moorthy for Shri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desigan, Perumal and  Thayar alone would go in procession. Thus, Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha  [[6]]    Desigan Sathumurai festival is entirely different from the Sathumurai  performed for other Alwars and Acharyars at Sri Devaraja Swamy Temple.
   Further, Shri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desigan does not participate in  Rapathu and Pagalpathu Uthsavam. During which, all Uthsava Moorthy’s,
   Alwars and Acharyars are assembled in front of Lord Varadar’s Sanctum  Sanctorium.
10. The performance of festival of Shri Thatha Desigan Sathumurai  day is fully governed by custom and usage followed in temple for more than 150 years and not by the Orders referred by the petitioner. Thus, the  respondents are bound by customs and usage followed in temple for centuries  and has no Authority to deviate from the same. Thus, the prayer sought for in  the present writ petition, if adopted, would deviate from the custom and  usage of the temple and therefore, the Writ Petition is to be rejected.
11. Let us look in to the scope of the order passed by the Board of  Commissioners, HR & CE Department, Chennai dated 03.02.1942 in  O.A.No.332 of 1941. The disputes were between the T.V.Bashyakar and (1)
    P.G.Raghavendra Rao, (2) R.Varadathathachariar (3) Tirupakuli Tirumalai  [[7]]      Thathachariar and (4) T.Ramanujachariar. The disputes before the Board of  Commissioners would reveal that its history has been disfigured by the  disputes between the Sects of Vaishnavites viz., Vadagalai’s and Thengalai’s  in regard to namams. The proceedings unfold another unfortunate quarrels  center around the festivals and honours to be shown to the Thengalai Guru of  Manavalamahamuni and other Alwars and Acharyars on their  Thirunakshatram day and the celebration of Rapathu and Pagalpathu  festivals.
12. The Board of Commissioners considered certain important  documents submitted by both Sects i.e., Thengalai and Vadagalai Sects. The  earliest document dated 14.12.1820, is a dictum for Sathumurai for four  Acharyars viz.Vedantachariar, Thatha Desigar, Manavalamahamuni and  Emberumanar. Rs.7 is the prescribed scale of expenditure for each Achariyar  as the word “Vagaira” is added after Vedantachariar at the heading.
13. It is not in dispute that the Thatha Desigan, the ancestor of  Thathacharies and a royal priest in the Court of Vijayanagar and a great  devotee to whom the temple owes much, enjoys the festival every year. In  [[8]]    , 1855 during his Sathumurai festival, the Trustees appear to have started the  procession with an alleged new copper idol of Thatha Desigan. The  Thengalai Sect is objected to this on the ground that the Utsavar idol had  been newly introduced by the Trustees. The Trustees appear to have  contended the Sathumurai festival used to be performed for Thatha Desigan  in the same manner as for other Alwars and Acharyars.
14. The above findings in the order passed by the Board of  Commissioners would reveal that Sathumurai festival by conducting  procession with Copper Idol of Shri Thatha Desigan was in practice from the  year 1855, which was objected and stopped. Therefore, the Sathumurai  festival to Sri Thatha Desigan was not conducted on par with the Sathumurai  festival being conducted for other Alwars and Acharyars in Sri Devaraja  Swamy Temple, at Kancheepuram.
15. In Paragraph No.14 of the order of the Board of Commissioners  generally indicate that on the evening of Sathumurai festival of Alwars and  Acharyars including Manavalamahamuni when there are Ubhayakars, Sri  Devaraja Swamy should be brought to the Shrine of the Alwars and  [[9]]      Acharyars concerned, after Sathumurai at the said Shrine, the Alwars and  Acharyars shall be taken procession through prakarams with Sri Devaraja  Swamy to the latter’s shrine as far as the foot of the hill and back to his  Shrine after Sri Devaraja is taken to his abode. This shall be the procedure, in  case there should be Ubhayakars forthcoming. If there are no Ubhayakars, the  Alwars and acharyars including the Manavalamahamuni will be taken in  procession alone in the morning of Sathumurai day to Sri Devaraja Swamy  Shrine and back to his own shrine after receiving honours.
16. Question arises whether Sri Thatha Desigan is to be included in  the procedure as contemplated in the order of the Board of Commissioners of  year 1942? In this context, it is useful to refer the order dated 13.04.2007  passed by the Commissioner of HR & CE Department in R.C.No.69511 of 2006. The Commissioner has passed the said proceedings dated 13.04.2007,
      pursuant to the order passed by the Hon'ble High Court dated 22.03.2000 to  consider the representation and dispose of the same.
17. High Court in its order dated 22.03.2000, referred about the  order passed in O.A.No.332 of 1941 and confirmed in A.S.No.147 of 1946 as  [[10]]      well as in R.P.No.257 of 2005 D2. The Commissioner has considered the  issues relating to the manner of performance of the Sathumurai’s with  reference to the order passed in O.A.No.332 of 1941 as confirmed in  A.S.No.147 of 1946. The Commissioner has relied on the consequential order  in R.P.No.257 of 2005, which enlighten the method by which dates for th  birth star of Alwars and Acharyars have been fixed. The observations made  in the orders in R.P.No.257 of 2005 to be “Custom and usage” was definitely  subject to the Court in O.A.No. 332 of 1941 and confirmed in A.S.No.147 of1946. Pertinently, the procedure has been stated after fixing the date, on  which the birth star of Alwars and acharyars falls, as per the procedures and  guidelines issued in R.P.No.257 of 2005, the Authorities concerned shall fix  the date for performance of Sathumurai for Alwars and Acharyars. The  Authorities are not at their liberty to fix the timings for the performance of  Sathumurai considering the Bramotsavam or other factors etc., The Executive  Trustee of the temple is directed to found out the birth star of Alwars and  acharyars, based on the procedures and guidelines issued under R.P.No.357  of 2005 and thereafter, to follow the procedures as enumerated in  O.A.No.332 of 1941 for the performance of Sathumurai, either in the  evening, if there are Ubhayakars or in the morning if there are no such  [[11]]      Ubhayakars. This procedure must be followed scrupulously and the calendar  for the particular year is to be finalised by the Temple Authorities. In the  above proceedings of the Commissioner, Alwars and acharyars covered  under O.A.No.332 of 1941 and confirmed in A.S.No.147 of 1946 and in  R.P.No.257 of 2005 have been stated as follows:
      “Alwars:
    1) Poigai Alwar
    2) Boothalwar
    3) Peyalwar
    4) Thirumazhisai Alwar
    5) Thiruppanalwar
    6) Thirumangai Alwar
    7) Madurakavi Alwar
    8) Kulasekara Alwar
    9) Thodaradipodi Alwar
    10) Periyalwar
    11) Nammalwar  Acharyars:
    1) Manavala Maamunigal
    2) Koorathalwar
    3) Aalavanthar
    4) Udaiyavar
    5) Desihan
    6) Naathamuni
    7) Thirukkachinambi”
   Though, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would submit that the  list of Alwars and Acharyars stated above in the order of the Commissioner  dated 13.04.2007 is only for the festival of Rapathu and Pagalpathu, the order  would indicate that the Commissioner has elaborately considered the custom  [[12]]      and usage regarding the Sathumurai festival for Alwars and acharyars.
18. The order in entirety would reveal that the Commissioner has  made repeated reference about the spirit of the order passed in O.A.No.332 of 1941. The Commissioner has specifically stated that Sathumurai has been  decided in O.A.No.332 of 1941 and confirmed in A.S.No.147 of 1946. The  Custom and Usage was definitely subject to the orders of this Court in  O.A.No.332 of 1941. The birth star of the Alwars/acharyars have to be fixed  and accordingly, Sathumurai is to be celebrated. When there is specific  reference to the spirit of the order to celebrate Sathumurai festival to Alwars  and Acharyars, the list furnished by the Commissioner would have  application and therefore, the arguments advanced by the learned Senior  Counsel for the petitioner, deserves no merit consideration. When the order  in entirely speaks about the Sathumurai festival of Alwars and Acharyars and  in the order itself names of Alwars and acharyars are indicated and  admittedly, the name of Thatha Desigan has not been included. Therefore, the  procedures adopted for Thatha Desigan cannot be compared with the  Sathumurai festival to be celebrated for Alwars and Acharyars as stated in the  Order of the Commissioner dated 13.04.2007.
      [[13]]    
19. The Assistant Commissioner/Executive Trustee of Arulmigu Sri  Devaraja Swamy Temple in his counter has categorically stated that unlike  other Alwars and Acharyars in the temple, there is no Utsavar Vigraham for  Sri Lakshmikumara Thatha Desigan. All other Alwars and Acharyars for  whom Sathumurai has been performed in the temple, on the yearly birthday  celebration have Utsavamoorthy Vigraham (Statue) taken in procession along  with Perumal after conclusion of Sathumurai. As there is no Uthsava  Moorthy for Sri Lakshmi Kumara Thatha Desigan, Perumal and Thayar alone  would go in procession. Thus, Sri Lakshmikumara Thatha Desigan  Sathumurai is entirely different from Sathumurai performed for other Alwars  and Acharyars at Sri Devaraja Swamy temple at Kancheepuram. The custom  and usage has been well considered as per practice prevailing in temple and  the temple Authorities have stated that the practice is in vogue for about 150  years. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the  Sathumurai festival being performed for Sri Thatha Desigan is to be  restricted, as being celebrated for other Alwars and Acharyars, deserve no  acceptance and rejected.
    [[14]]    
20. More so, the Commissioner in the impugned order has  elaborately considered all the issues, custom and usage prevailing in Sri  Devaraja Swami Temple at Kancheepuram with reference to Sathumurai  festival to Sri Thatha Desigan and that being so, this Court is not inclined to  interfere with the said order. Accordingly, the Writ Petition stands dismissed.

No costs.
