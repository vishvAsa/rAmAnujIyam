## bengaLUru kRShNa temple
The temple had issues once - mysore raja mediated and made it a temple of both kalais. Remarkably meticulous. Quite unlike modern India we know. 


- There will always be a VK and TK archaka, and urdhwapundras marked in the temple (vigrahas or sculptures or walls) 50-50
- If one left dwarapalaka is VK the next prAkAra left dwarapalaka will be TK.
- for azhwars half have VK utsava TK moolavar and rest have VK moolavar and TK utsava
- even elephants are painted 50-50 very meticulously
