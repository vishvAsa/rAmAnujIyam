      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro71&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Bhagavad Gītā (7-14), the Lord stated that those who take refuge in Him alone can get beyond Māyā (Prakṛti). Then and then only, the ‘Prakṛti’ helps towards liberation instead of hindering by concealing the real nature of the Lord. The net woven around each individual soul by the Almighty Lord, in the light of past Karma, has to be disentangled by Him alone, seeing that we are much-too-feeble and cannot disentangle even the nest built by a frail bird, in the manner it does. Only He can undo this bondage of ours, when we clasp His holy feet as the Sole Saviour. It was against this background that the Āḻvār sought refuge at the feet of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam in VI-10-10. But then, it didn’t yield the desired result immediately. Why was it so?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro72&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the sixth centum, we saw the Āḻvār surrendering himself at the feet of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. Finding, however, that he was still lingering in this material world, dominated by the unruly senses, he cried out his fears in the last decad. like unto a child crying out from the tiger’s jaws, facing the mother standing in front. The Lord was, no doubt, well aware of the intensity of the Āḻvār’s God-love and his deep yearning to get out of the material shackles with no further delay. And yet. He deliberately prolonged the Āḻvār’s stay in this abode and his resultant uneasiness, just to do lasting good to the world at large through him. Of course, this is like starving one’s children and entertaining the guests. Actually, the Āḻvār wrought the miracle of transforming the very duds and the deluded, given up as incorrigibles even by the Omnipotent Lord and every moment of his stay in this abode would certainly enrich the world through the scintillating hymns flowing from his lips, both by way of adoring the Lord and advising the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro73&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bliss of the union of the Nāyaki and Lord Raṅganātha having overflown its continents, the Lord hit upon a method whereby the enjoyment could be stabilised instead of the Nāyaki being swept off by its exuberance. He went to Tentiruppēreyil, near the Āḻvār’s birth-place, game-hunting by way of relieving the distress of the people over there from the depredations of wild animals. The Nāyaki herself equipped Him with weapons, went with Him straight to the outer gate and bid Him farewell, wishing Him success. The Lord, mounted on Garuḍa, threw a bewitching parting glance at her. But then, she couldn’t bear the separation and insisted that she would also go to Tentiruppēreyil to join her Lord, in the face of opposition from her mother, mates and other, kinsmen. The Nāyakī, bent upon going, suggests a via-media namely, if they are against her going alone, they could as well escort her to the place and leave her there with her Lord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro74&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just when the Nāyakī was attempting to go to Tiruppēreyil where the Lord had gone for game-hunting, He returned victorious, like Śrī Rāma back home from exile, after vanquishing Rāvaṇa and his formidable horde of Rākṣasas. It may be recalled that Sītā locked Śrī Rāma in her sweet embrace by way of nursing wounds on His person after His remarkable victory over Kara, Dhūṣaṇa, Triśiras and the fourteen thousand Rākṣasas under them, singlehanded and in an amazingly short space of time. Even so, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, exceedingly jubilant over the Lord’s quick return from His victorious hunting expedition, gets locked up in His sweet embrace, by way of relieving His fatigue. In her festive mood, she also goes on recounting the Lord’s wondrous deeds and benefaction, vast and varied, as set out in this decad, exclaiming, “What a marvel!” “what a wonder!” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro75&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār, who revelled in the last decad, recounting some of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord in this decad, much to his own delectation. At the same time, he could not help wondering how the worldlings, whose birthright it is to share this enjoyment, kept aloof and he even felt vexed with them for their callous indifference. What a pity! Oblivious of the huge treasure of gold, buried within inches right in the centre courtyard of their houses, these folks struggle elsewhere with swollen feet in search of fleeting wealth of no consequence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro76&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Saint’s address to the world is implicit, although the third person has been used throughout, instead of the second. No doubt, the worldlings kept aloof from God because of their exclusive absorption in sensual pleasures, totally shorn of God-love. But then, here is the Āḻvār with an enormous yearning for the Lord, of unimaginable depth and yet, he has not been able to experience the bliss of lasting communion with Him. We have of course seen him ravished by internal joy, during those delirious moments of union with the Lord (mental vision), overflowing its contents and finding expression through hymns adoring Him and extolling His great glory. In the contrary state of desertion by the Lord, he would lament loudly as in this decad, melting the stony hearts of even the ungodly. Śrī Nampiḷḷai puts it that the Āḻvār’s lamentations were so loudly vociferous that it looked as if a vast ocean rose on its feet and roared with all its might; surely it cannot but dislodge the Lord from His seat in the high Heaven and compel Him to come down to the Āḻvār and oblige him with His sweet presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro77&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The soul-stirring utterances of the Saint, as in the last decad, should indeed have gone straight to the Lord in Heaven. In a way, the Lord would seem to have pacified the Āḻvār by enabling him to comprehend mentally His exquisite Form, limb by limb. Led away by the Lord’s charming beauty, the Āḻvār, aims at physical enjoyment of the Lord’s exquisite Form, with outstretched hands and feels frustrated when such an experience is denied to him. Thrown into deep dejection, the Āḻvār, once again (figuratively) transformed as the Nāyakī, hits back the mates and elders. She asserts that she could hardly yield to their threats and cajoling, overwhelmed as she was by the Lord’s bewitching Form, in all its details, on a par with physical perception through the senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro78&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Alvar felt tormented by the mental vision of the Lord’s limbs, one after the other, rousing his appetite for God-enjoyment all the more. The Lord would not, however, fulfil the Āḻvār’s aspiration even now and is obviously waiting for the appropriate moment of consummation. The Āḻvār knows the Lord’s mind all right but still he is egged on by the exuberance of his God-love to crave for immediate union. So great was his ardour that non-fulfilment thereof should have normally resulted in his immediate extinction. He was, however, still kept alive, much to his surprise and he enquired of the Lord how exactly He enacted this wonder. “Well,” said the Lord “this is not the only wonder wrought by Me, better behold My kaleidoscopic cosmic wealth”. The Lord thus exhibited unto the Āḻvār many wonders, as against just one on which he sought elucidation. Overawed by the amazing magnitude of the Lord’s wealth and wonders, even as sage Akrūra beheld with dismay the Divine Brothers (Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa) inside the running water of river Yamunā, as well as on the river bank, the Āḻvār voices forth in this decad, his mental reactions to the wonderful phenomena in front of him. It might be recalled that the Lord had displayed unto the Āḻvār His cosmic wealth and splendour earlier also in III-4 and VI-3. In III-4, however, the Āḻvār just didn’t know where to begin and what to say, unable to express himself with any degree of precision; in VI-3, the Lord revealed His extra-ordinary capacity to/achieve the impossible and compose, with perfect ease, the incompatibles, the opposites, within His fold. And now, we see an over-awed Āḻvār attempting to describe the wonderful phenomena before him and seeking clarification from the Lord in respect of the bewildering complexities, baffling intellectual comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro79&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was indeed the Lord’s ingenuity that was in full evidence in the last decad, whereby He could gain time and divert the attention of the Āḻvār, astounded by the bewildering net-work of His superb wonders. In fact, we have seen this kind of happening all along, the appeasement of the Āḻvār at every turn by the Lord, exhibiting one or the other of His special traits and prolonging his stay in this abode. But now, the Āḻvār is determined to clinch the issue and demand of the Lord, what precisely makes Him resort to such tantalising tactics, without responding to the request made by him far back, in the opening song of his very first hymnal (Tiruviruttam) that he should be lifted from this foul body, full of dirt and devilry. Was there anything wanting in regard to his yearning or did the Lord’s capacity to salve him decline? No, neither this nor that. But then, why should the Lord extend his stay in this cussed land with its sordid surroundings? Well, this is precisely the Āḻvār’s query unto the Supreme Lord, to which the Lord’s answer is “Āḻvār! You jolly well know my intention and yet speak as if you are ignorant. Well, I have kept you in this abode to get from you the soul-stirring hymns of unparalleled sweetness for the edification and enjoyment of Myself and My devotees even as I kept the wise Bhīsma in the specially erected bed of arrows for quite some length of tune and enriched the world through the dissemination of knowledge by that great Savant”. The Āḻvār feels overawed by the Lord’s tender solicitude and extraordinary love for him and exclaims: “My Lord, You are known to be above all wants and it is indeed very strange that you too should be suffering from a want like this. Even assuming that you have one such desire, You could have easily got it fulfilled by sages Vālmīki, Vyāsa, Parāśara and others of that eminent order or by the first three Āḻvārs, the divine bards, &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;. It is indeed amazing that You should have chosen me, the lowliest of the lowly, absolutely ill-equipped, for this great assignment. This is indeed the limit of Your loving condescension.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro710&#34;&gt;00 Intro7.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār, who thought in terms of repaying the Lord’s kindness in choosing him, of all persons, for the sacred mission of singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, was bewildered on finding nothing, he could offer unto the Lord, for there wasn’t anything he could call his own and the Lord, who is above wants of any kind, would need anything from him either. The merciful Lord would not, however, keep a devotee of such a high order in a state of mental torture. And so, He told the Āḻvār that he too would be given a chance to fulfil his desire by singing this hymnal in the pilgrim centre, called ‘Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai’ (Kerala State), unto Him and His Divine Consorts, much to Their delectation. It may be recalled, at this stage, that Śrī Rāma listened to His own story, Rāmāyaṇa, sung by Kuśa and Lava, the Divine lads, His own progeny. Even so, it was not on all fours with the assignment currently given to the Āḻvār by the Lord. There Śrī Rāma was alone when He granted audience to the young minstrels, having got separated from Sītā, the Divine Mother, whose story, (Sītāyāścaritam mahat) Rāmāyaṇa virtually is. But here, the Lord in His Iconic form, is looking forward to the ecstatic experience of listening to the rapturous songs of Tiruvāymoḻi, sung by the love-intoxicated Āḻvār, in the company of His Divine Consorts. The Āḻvār leaps with joy, finding that the Lord not only got the hymns sung by him but was also intent upon listening to his chanting them. How gracious of Him indeed! The Āḻvār, therefore, attempts to render the service assigned to him, at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai in this decad, looking upon that holy place as his final goal, to the exclusion of all else, even as Hanumān said ‘Bhāvonānyatragacchati’, thereby expressing his stout determination not to forsake this land trodden upon by Lord Rāma and go elsewhere, not even the much-coveted Heaven. As a matter of fact, God would have nothing of our own and there is nothing we can call our own either. All that He expects from us, in return for all that He does, is to do His bidding and this is taken by Him as adequate expression of our gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
