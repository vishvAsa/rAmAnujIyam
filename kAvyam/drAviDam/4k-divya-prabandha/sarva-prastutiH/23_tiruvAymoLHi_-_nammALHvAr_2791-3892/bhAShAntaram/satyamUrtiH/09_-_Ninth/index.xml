      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro91&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad (8-10), the Āḻvār had revealed to us the quintessence of his creed, namely, looking upon the Lord’s devotees as his ‘Be-all’ and ‘End-all ‘All-in-one the sole means for attaining ‘Mokṣa’ (Salvation). The Saint is further elaborating it, in this decad. in a manner highly delectable to the devotees, in whom he has taken refuge. The superficial reader might think that this decad strikes a note different from that of the immediately preceding decad inasmuch as the Āḻvār now looks upon the Lord as the aggregate of all conceivable kinship, one can claim. There is, however, no incompatibility between these two decads, the current one being but an elaboration of the theme, set out in the last decad. Even as ‘Bhagavad śeṣatva’, that is, service unto the Lord culminates in ‘Bhāgavata śeṣatva’, that is, service unto His devotees, the latter, in its natural sequence, steps into the domain of the former. It is indeed a matter of common knowledge that our love to a specified individual extends up to all those intimately connected with him or her. Likewise, love unto the godly men is automatically carried over to all those closely associated with them and the love so generated reverts to the Lord, as the one loved and revered by the devotees. In Śloka 51 of ‘Śrīguṇaratna Kośam’ of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the illustrious author declares his love unto Lord Raṅganātha, as one stemming from his being the Spouse of Goddess Śrī Raṅga Nāyakī (Śrī Mahālakṣmī). And then, reciprocally, the Upaniṣad reveals its predilection for the Divine Mother, in view of Her being the Consort of the Supreme Lord, the great Ordainer of the universe—‘Asyeśānā Jagato Viṣṇupatnī’? Surely, there is no contradiction between these two versions, as they are mutually inclusive and not exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro92&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inviolable and eternal bond between us and the Supreme Lord, Who combines in Him the different facets of earthly relationship known to us, was stressed upon in the last decad, incidentally throwing overboard our so-called relationship with all the rest. The Upaniṣads proclaim that the Lord is “All-in-one”, “&lt;em&gt;Mātā Pitā, Brātā, Nivāsaś Śaraṇam Suhrut gathir Nārāyaṇa&lt;/em&gt;”. Actually, He stays in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) Form, in the pilgrim centre known as Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, only to extend to His votaries all the benefits which they could expect from their earthly relations, mother, father, brother etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro93&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār fervently prayed that the Lord be pleased to turn His sweet glances on him, grant audience to him and the denizens of all the three worlds, remaining in a seated posture, beckon him or come down to him and permit him to stroke His lovely pair of feet and so on. The Lord, however, focussed the Saint’s attention on the fundamental relationship that subsists between them, which hardly affords scope for such entreaties by him and, much less, for the grief that results from the Lord’s apparent non-compliance. The basic fact of the Lord being none other than Nārāyaṇa, in whom all things and beings inhere and who abides in all, reduces all things and beings to the abject position of mere bodies unto the Life within, that dominates, directs, and supports them. Consoled thus by the Lord, in quite a convincing manner, the Saint not only regains his composure but admires the Lord’s tender solicitude for His subjects. This decad gives expression to the Saint’s rapturous admiration of the Lord’s great concern for His creatures and loving condescension. Having set out in VIII-8, the substance of the eight-lettered, three-syllabled Tirumantra and dwelt on the deep urge for Divine Service which ‘Āya’, the dative case-ending of the word ‘Nārāyaṇāya’ in the said Mantra reveals, the Āḻvār spells out the Mantra itself, in the opening song of this decad, which declares: “Nārāyaṇaṉ is our sole Benefactor”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 Maiyar Karunkanni</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/rAmAnujIyam/kAvyam/drAviDam/4k-divya-prabandha/sarva-prastutiH/23_tiruvAymoLHi_-_nammALHvAr_2791-3892/bhAShAntaram/satyamUrtiH/09_-_Ninth/04_Maiyar_Karunkanni/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro94&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Śāstras’ (Scriptural texts) proclaim, on the one hand, that the Supreme Lord is One of unbridled independence, and on the other, depict Him as an embodiment of innumerable auspicious traits. The latter get submerged when the former holds sway. But when the Lord’s independence gets subdued through the irresistible spell cast by Mahā Lakṣmī’s personal magnetism and the persuasive eloquence of Her pleadings, the auspicious qualities denoted by His name, ‘Nārāyaṉa’, become pronounced. These are: Tender solicitude (Vātsalya), Sovereignty (Svāmitva), Loving condescension (Sauśīlya), Easy accessibility (Saulabhya), knowledge (Jñāna) and Power or Energy (Śakti). Fully aware that the Lord does possess, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt;, the trait of loving condescension and that the Divine Mother is the fountain source of inspiration for the influx of this grand trait, the Āḻvār naturally grieved, all the more, over his erstwhile plight of separation from the Lord, despite his inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him. The Āḻvār pined for the on-coming of the Lord, in the manner He rushed to the rescue of Gajendra, the pious elephant in dire distress and sprang forth from the pillar to shed His unique grace on Prahlādha, the young devotee. The Lord, on His part, was keen to maintain His reputation as the Repository of all auspicious qualities and presented Himself to the Āḻvār; if He did not respond to the Āḻvār’s call even now, despite His deep yearning, all that is claimed for Him by the Scriptures would be of no more than academic value, mere words, high-sounding like the roaring of the sea. Overjoyed by the Lord’s presence (mental vision), the Āḻvār ends up this decad by giving vent ro his gratitude for the Lord having pressed him into service and got these hymns, sung by him, for the edification of the pious. “What a bliss and that too, bestowed on a single individual!” is how the Āḻvār revolves in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro95&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lord pulled the Āḻvār out of his erstwhile dejection, by reminding him of the great felicity, conferred by Him. This refers to the Āḻvār’s great role in singing these hymns for the delectation of the devout. The Āḻvār also felt gratified that it was indeed a great gift of the loving Lord and this sustained the Āḻvār for the time being, as we saw in the last decad. But then, in the eighth song of that decad, the Āḻvār referred to his having got the vision of Lord Kṛṣṇa, a by-gone Avatāra (Incarnation). This led him on to the desire for external perception of the Lord as well, without being confined to a mere mental vision. It did not, however, materialise, as the Lord was intent upon rousing theĀḻvār’s appetite for Him to still further heights, before He would eventually present Himself physically. Worn out by dejection, due to this seeming desertion by the Lord, the Āḻvār tried to divert his mind by seeking the fellowship of things around, bearing the Lord&amp;rsquo;s likeness. But the very things, chosen for diversion, served only as incentives to remind the Āḻvār, all the more, about the Lord and thus torment him. The Āḻvār’s sad predicament in IV-4 is worth recalling, in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro96&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the tenth song of the last decad, the Āḻvār’s declaration that he had joined his Lord in Heaven and that his physical frame, left behind, would also fall off in a day or two, might make one feel that it marked the end of his stay in this abobe. And yet, the Āḻvār remained inside the hollow of the sacred tamarind tree for quite some time and sang some more of these nectarean hymns. How and what indeed sustained him and kept him on, in this abode? Could it be that the Lord obliged him with His sweet vision and sustained him? No, He did not. It was only the Āḻvār’s vivid, rather, absorbing recollection of the immensity of the Lord’s love during their erstwhile union, experienced by him in VIII-7, that warmed him up. This is how the contemplation, in retrospect, of her uninterrupted and exclusive enjoyment of Lord Rāma’s sweet company and auspicious traits for twelve long years in the Palace at Ayodhyā, helped to sustain Sita, during her captivity in Laṅkā. Actually, it is the Supreme Lord, Who, as the Internal Controller, induced this kind of reminiscence and the resultant effervescence of love in the Āḻvār and got, out of him, the further songs of this illuminating hymnal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro97&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār sustained himself, in a way, by contemplating the Lord’s auspicious traits, as in the last decad. In the process, he, however, developed a deep yearning for direct perception of the Lord. This led him on to send emissaries to the Lord to come down and grace him with His presence. And now, here is the last of the four decads in which messages were sent to the Lord by the Āḻvār, figuratively transformed as a forlorn female lover, the other three being I-4, VI-1 and VI-8. It may be recalled that the destinations of the messages sent to the Lord in the earlier decads, were the Milk-ocean, where the Lord stays in His ‘Vyuha’ form, the seat of creative activity, His incarnate forms and His transcendental Form in Heaven as well as His ‘Antaryāmi’ or hidden Form, as the Internal Controller. The traits of the Lord, which held out a special fascination to the Nāyakī, while sending those messages, were, Forgiveness, His creed or pledge to extend protection to His devotees and His feeling of oneness with His devotees (aikarasya) (&lt;em&gt;i.e&lt;/em&gt;.) sense of identity with them and deep compassion. The message, as in this decad, is, however, addressed to the Lord in His ‘Arca’ (Iconic, worshippable) form, the special accent being on His enchanting beauty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro98&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Saint despatched several messengers to the Lord at Tirumūḻikkaḷam and yet, he could hardly contain the effervescence of God-love in him. He could not patiently await the return of the emissaries from the Lord and so, he tried to sustain himself by meeting the Lord enshrined in Tirunāvāy (another pilgrim centre in Kerala State, the number of such pilgrim centres in that State adding up to thirteen.) But, in his present state of desolation and debility, he could not make the trip to that pilgrim centre. The next best he could do was, therefore, to meditate on the Lord at Tirunāvāy, right from where he was. This is precisely what he does, in this decad. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Āḻvār was now in the same mental state as Sītā was, during the period intervening Hanumān’s visit to her in Aśokavana and her eventual restoration to Lord Rāma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro99&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our great preceptors used to call this decad, as the ‘Evening brawl’ and the third decad in the next (tenth) centum, as the ‘Morning squabble’. In the latter decad, the Āḻvār enters the vein of the Gopis, the damsels of Virundāvaṉ, who quarrelled with Kṛṣṇa early in the morning when he was about to take the cattle to the pastures for grazing, dissuading him from going to the outlying fields, in view of their inability to brook separation from him for a whole day, not to speak of the lurking danger from Kaṃsa’s spies and evil agents. In this decad. the Āḻvār experiences the pangs of separation, undergone by the Gopīs during those evenings, when Kṛṣṇa was a little late in returning home after tending the grazing cattle, by day. On certain evenings, Kṛṣṇa would return at the head of the cattle, sounding the bugle, while, on other days. He would allow the cattle to go ahead and walk behind them. Well, during those evenings, when Kṛṣṇa did not make His appearance first but chose to walk behind the cattle, even that little prolongation of Kṛṣṇa’s absence upset the Gopīs who suffered the anguish of an age. The Āḻvār is found in this decad. experiencing, singly, the pangs experienced by all of them in the above context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro910&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the eighth decad of this Centum, the Āḻvār exhibited his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord and his great grief, due to the non-realisation of the union longed for, found expression in the following decad. Seeing the Āḻvār, in such dire distress, the Lord spoke to him thus: “Well, your grief apart, mine is indeed greater than yours, inasmuch as I have not, as yet, got at you and the privation is mine; it is only for your sake that I have come down, all the way, from the High Heavens to the holy centre of Tirukkaṇṇapuram, near at hand. Surely, I will grant you your desire, at the end of the current span of life”, Thus placated, the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy, in this decad. The fifth song of this decad is the topical one, stressing the fact that the Lord is the great Benefactor, the granter of Mokṣa (eternal emancipation) when the body falls off, at the end of the current span of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
