      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro41&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last centum ended on a very happy note, an exuberant Āḻvār, gratefully conscious of the felicities showered on him by a loving Lord, declaring that he is above wants of any kind and free from afflictions of any kind. Just the opposite is, however, the plight of the ‘Saṃsāris’ (worldlings), and it was out of an irrepressible fellow-feeling and deep compassion that the Āḻvār tried to bring them all, on a par with him and advised them in III-9 (coṉṉāl virōtam) to give up running after the petty humans and their petty wealth. The desired response was, however, not forthcoming presumably because the men whom the Āḻvār then addressed were thinking in terms of somehow enriching themselves by waiting on the so called earthly potentates. And yet, the Āḻvār’s tender solicitude turns his attention on to them once again, and that too, so soon. In this decad, he impresses upon his addressees that, for all their mountainous labours, they get much less than a mouse, in return, the so-called wealth they acquire being after all much-too-flimsy and fleeting. So saying, the Āḻvār calls upon these straying subjects to realise the importance of holding on to the Supreme Lord as an end in itself, the wealth supreme and everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro42&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the eighth decad of the third centum, the Āḻvār and his sense-organs intensely longed for the enjoyment of Ged, in a spirit of competitive exuberance. In the three succeeding decads, this God-hunger was temporarily displaced, partly by the Āḻvār’s preoccupation with his fellow-beings and partly by his joyous recounting of the various benefits conferred on him by the bounteous Lord. And now, in this decad, the Āḻvār’s God-hunger has lifted up its head once again, the recoiling, as it were, of the Āḻvār’s advice to the worḻdlingson the Āḻvār himself. Well, this is precisely what happened when Vibhīṣaṇa advised Rāvaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa’s advice, as we all know, fell on deaf eats but, at the same time, it led to Vibhīṣaṇa himself getting into Śrī Rāma’s camp. And then, take the case of Prahlāda. The little lad&amp;rsquo;s advice to an unresponsive and uncompromising fiend of a father (Hiṟaṇya) only tended to enrich the former’s God-love. The Āḻvār’s God-love having been excited, he longs for the Lord’s vision, as during His Avatāras, in the days gone-by. So deep is his longing that the frustration resulting from its non-fulfilment renders the Āḻvār insensate, like a female forsaken by her lover after their erstwhile union. The mother steps in, once again, to describe the critical condition of her daughter, the Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro43&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This decad would appear to have been appreciated in three different ways by the ‘Pūrvācāryas’ (Preceptors of yore), as indicated below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(i) According to Empār, the Lord did not, as such, fulfil the aspiration of the Āḻvār, as set out in the preceding decad, but focussed his attention on some of His auspicious traits enjoying which the Āḻvār remains oblivious of his erstwhile longing. This is like the baby crying for the Moon being appeased by a substitute, say, a Coconut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro44&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār rejoiced, over head and ears, in the sweet contemplation of the connubial love subsisting between him and the Lord. The Lord, however, apprehended that the Āḻvār might be swept off his feet and thrown overboard by such exuberance of joy, the overwhelming divine ecstasy jeopardising one’s very existence. As already pointed out, at length, in the preamble to 1-9, He is known to regulate the flow of His grace, consistent with the recipient’s capacity for in-ṭake and He, therefore, brought down the tempo, a little, just to stabilise the Āḻvār’s God-enjoyment. Even this slight diminution, in his erstwhile enjoyment, upset the Āḻvār and reduced him to the plight of Śrī Rāma, during his separation from Sītā. Śrī Rāma is said to have gone about asking the trees, the rivers (east-bound female rivers as well as the west-bound male rivers) and other inanimate objects, about the whereabouts of Sītā. And now, the Āḻvār, transformed once again as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, in a state of heavy depression, runs after the objects resembling her beloved Lord, in one respect or another, and things usually associated with Him and the disenchantment brought about, on nearer approach, makes her dumb-founded. This is like a man, dispossessed of his treasure, the money-bag, running about frantically, mistaking, as his own, the bags of others resembling his lost bag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>05 Virriruntu el ulakum</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro45&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Āḻvār was seen in the last decad in a heavy state of depression, it was because the Lord intended it to be so. Even as hunger is the pre-requisite for consuming food, for God-enjoyment in its entirety, a consuming passion of the highest intensity, as seen in the climactic tenth decad of the tenth centum, is imperative. Meanwhile, what is happening is a course of Shock-treatment, working the Āḻvār up to the required pitch. By experiencing, alternately, the bliss of Divine presence and rapport and the cruel pangs of separation from Him, the Āḻvār’s appetite for God-enjoyment is whetted and his divine love and wisdom enriched all the time. If the Lord had stayed away from the Āḻvār altogether without obliging him with His vision, now and then, both the Lord and the world would have lost him. Apart from the afore-mentioned technique adopted by the Lord to enrich and intensify the Āḻvār’s God-love, his continued stay in this abode has enriched the world through his hymns of unparalleled excellence, a rich fare for the devotees revelling in sweet contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds. This is yet another purpose of the Lord in lengthening the Āḻvār’s stay in this abode. And so, we see in this decad the very antithesis of the Āḻvār’s harrowing experience in the last decad; his joy knows no bounds and leads him on to exclaim, “Could there be any want for me hereafter?”, “Is there any one equal to me in all the world?” and so on. The structure of this decad suggests that the Āḻvār is right at the peak of divine bliss and, in the opinion of Nañcīyar, this could as well have been the very last decad of this grand hymnal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro46&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār was seen at the acme of divine bliss, bubbling with joy and fully satisfied. The Lord has, however, since withdrawn Himself from the Āḻvār’s mental vision and he is now consigned to the bottom-most depths of dejection, transformed once again as a ‘Nāyakī’, unable to speak out her woe. It is her mate that speaks, in this decad. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is thinning down alarmingly, in her present state of extreme desolation. The elderly women around who notice this with great concern, seek the help of the professional sooth-sayer (a female gipsy) for divining the cause of the Nayaki’s malady and suggesting the remedies therefor. On being told by the gipsy that the Nāyakī is under the spell of a minor (inferior) deity, these women proceed to propitiate that deity with the customary offerings of meat, liquor etc, as advised by the concerned priest. This only aggravates the mental agony of the Nāyakī and, at this stage, her mate, who knows the real cause of the Nāyakī’s malady, is critical of the steps taken by the womenfolk and vehemently condemns them. Thus, this decad brings out the Āḻvār’s singular devotion to Lord Viṣṇu and his total abhorrence, rather intolerance of anything which smacks of allegiance to the minor deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro47&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār, who was insensate in the last decad, due to the poignancy of his separation from the Lord, just regained consciousness, when the holy names of the Lord, chanted by the women around, trickled down his ears. This is like a creeper, dried up and lying low, becoming green again, when rain-drops fall on it. But then, it has only made matters worse for the Āḻvār. While in a state of coma, the patient feels no pain but when he regains consciousness, the pain becomes all the more acute. Hunger pinches a person to the marrow of his bone but luckily, sleep overtakes him. Hunger does not press its claim for the duration of his sleep but when he wakes up, the pangs of hunger are even more pronounced than before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro48&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār’s passionate appeal to the Lord, in the last decad, did not yield the desired result. The Lord didn’t present Himself before the ardent devotee, and the latter, therefore, concluded that he was not in His good books. And, in this context, the Alvar felt that neither he nor his possessions deserved to exist. The very valuable Śāstraic meaning that anything, which hinders Divine Service and does not actively aid and participate in such service, deserves to be eschewed, is imparted in this decad. The Āḻvār is now in the same predicament as that of Sītā during her captivity in Laṅkā. Sītā then exclaimed that her very existence was meaningless, staying so far away from her Lord and not rescued by Him as yet. The sentiments expressed by the Āḻvār in this decad, are fully echoed by Saint Yāmuna, in Śloka 57 of his ‘Stotra Ratna’. The saint swears that he would not tolerate for a moment anything which was outside the domain of His service, be it his body, his very life, the happiness desired by all beings, the Soul and other social relations like wife, children, friends etc., and that he would want all these to get destroyed in a hundred ways, if they proved a hindrance to Divine Service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro49&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār got terribly vexed with himself and his possessions and wanted to give up his body, life, that and the other. But, even for this kind of dissolution, he had to depend upon the Lord’s help, as in the case of salvation. And so, he prays to the Lord to finish him off altogether. The Āḻvār’s ardour in this respect is remarkable. His longing to get out of this world is due to (1) frequent interruptions in communion with the Lord and the resultant pangs of separation, (2) intolerance of contacts with the worldlings, straying away from Him and (3) the cruel impact of the five senses and the domineering sense-organs, with the serious risk of his straying back into the domain of the sensual pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro410&#34;&gt;00 Intro4.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār expressed his abhorrence of the ways of the world and lustily pleaded with the Lord, in the last decad, that he be removed at once from this infernal land. And yet, the Lord did not take him away but contrived to pacify him by exhibiting to him the heavenly splendour, right here, and to keep him on here. The Lord’s idea in doing so was to propagate, in this confounded world, the true knowledge about God-head, through the Āḻvār’s hymns, &lt;em&gt;par-excellence&lt;/em&gt;, shorn of doubts, discrepancies and deviations. The Āḻvār seems to have taken due note of the Lord’s intentions; he preaches, in this decad, the Supremacy of Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and tries to disabuse the people of their mistaken notions in this regard and wean them away from the propitiation of other deities. Of course, the Āḻvār has already dwelt on the Supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in I-1 and II-2, based on His ‘Para’ (transcendent) and ‘Vibhava’ (incarnate) aspects, respectively. And now, he establishes the Lord’s Supremacy in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) aspect and, for this purpose, he concentrates on the Lord, enshrined in Kurukūr itself, as He bears the name, ‘Ādinātha’, the First Lord or Progenitor and it comes in handy to establish His Supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
