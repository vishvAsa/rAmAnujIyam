      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro81&#34;&gt;00 Intro8.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār longed for the pleasure of singing Tiruvāymoḻi before the Divine couple at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai and rendering unto Them other kinds of service as well. But then, the project did not get off the ground and non-fulfilment of his cherished desire made the Āḻvār grow sceptical of the Lord’s bonafides and His ability to concede the wish of His devotees. This doubt is expressed in this decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro92&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār began to suspect that, with his coming into the world, the Lord’s reputation as the repository of many an auspicious trait and the grand ordainer of all things, was becoming extinct. The Āḻvār was, however, brought back to normal thinking by the Lord and the Āḻvār’s misgivings were cleared up in a way. But then, the external perception of the Lord’s exquisite Form and physical contact, longed for by the Saint, did not, as yet, materialise. This, therefore, gave rise to yet another doubt in the mind of the Āḻvār whether the Lord was keeping away from him on the ground that he was still not quite free from worldly desires. No doubt, the Āḻvār kept himself studiously aloof from the world and its meretritious charms, as far as he could be conscious of it. And yet, the Omniscient Lord might have found traces of worldly desires still lurking inside the Āḻvār unknown to him, and this was perhaps the reason why the Lord was holding back. The Āḻvār. therefore, thought of clearing up even this inkling of a doubt and vindicating his absolute detachment from the world and its affairs, but did not open up a direct dialogue with the Lord. Instead, he resorted to the device of informing the Lord and impressing upon&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Him through argumentation between the Nāyakī and her mates and elders, the theme of the dialogue being as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro94&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s presence, in this dark land, alone and unaided, excited the reasonable fear of the Āḻvār that the worldlings would approach Him only to achieve their own selfish ends, with little or no care or love for Him. No doubt, the Lord allayed the Āḻvār’s fears, as we saw towards the end of the last decad. Still, the Lord has a lingering doubt that, in the exuberance of the Āḻvār’s love for Him, he might once again entertain similar fears about His safety and feel agitated. And so. He wanted to dispel the Āḻvār’s fears, with no chance whatever of their revival and revealed unto him His invulnerable abode in Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu (in present Kerala State), out of bounds to the ungodly, attended by the mighty band of three thousand Vedic scholars, full of devotion. As a further precaution, the Lord also exhibited unto the Āḻvār, His wondrous deeds revealing His extra-ordinary strength and valour. With his fears thus eradicated &lt;em&gt;in toto&lt;/em&gt;, the Āḻvār could whole-heartedly enjoy in this decad the Lord’s exquisite beauty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro95&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the third decad of this centum, the Āḻvār grew apprehensive of the safety of the Lord of exquisite charm, moving along in this wicked land alone and unattended. The Āḻvār could, however, regain his composure, shaking off the fear in question, on the assurance given by the Lord, vide VIII-3-10. The following decad revealed an Āḻvār, fully relieved of his erstwhile fears, but the intense mental enjoyment of the Lord’s regal Form, enchanting every inch, resorted to by the Āḻvār in VIII-4-7, once again resulted in a deep yearning, an insatiable longing for external perception of the Lord’s Form, as envisioned by him and getting locked in His sweet embrace. Non-fulfilment of his longing has consigned the Āḻvār to the bottom-most depths of dejection, the like of which has not been witnessed in the earlier decade. He cries out, like unto one bodily trapped in a forest fire and his limbs appear to be even more worn out than their owner. The Saint beckons the Lord to appear before him in all His regal splendour, wearing His crown, tall and majestic and moving along, like the exhilarating rain-cloud, the rising Sun, so on and so forth. The Lord did not, however, respond and so, this decad ends on a despondent note, the Āḻvār being led to believe that he would just pass away, immured in grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro96&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār’s yearning, in the last decad, was indeed too deep for words. At the same time, it has to be stressed that, if the Jñāni loves God dearly, He loves the Jñāni even more. And so, the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār also defies description. Stung by a deep sense of remorse over His laxity in not responding to the Āḻvār’s invitation, the Lord pondered over the step to be taken by Him to placate the Āḻvār. But then, if He straightaway presented Himself before the Āḻvār, in his present state of mind, he would just collapse, due to excessive joy. It was, therefore, expedient that the Āḻvār’s enjoyment of the Lord should be induced by stages, so as to be stable, without anything untoward happening. This was precisely the reason why Śrī Rāma despatched Hanumān first to meet Bharata and convey to him the news of His return from exile soon. It was only a day later, after availing of Sage Bharadvāja’s hospitality en route, that Rama met Bharata who was meanwhile getting ready to receive the elder, back home from His long exile. Lord Kṛṣṇa likewise adopted the ‘go-slow’ tactics by making a night-halt outside Hastināpur and going to the citadel, only the next day. Meanwhile, news had reached the ardent devotees like Vidhura, of the impending visit of the Lord on His famous errand to Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s court. But for this phased programme, excessive joy due to the sudden arrival of Lord Kṛṣṇa would have upset those devotees and thrown them into a state of mental imbalance. In this particular case, the Lord who wished the Āḻvār to come and mingle with Him freely, stationed Himself at the pilgrim centre, known as Tirukkaṭittāṉam (in Kerala State). The Āḻvār, who got scent of it, felt greatly elated over the Lord’s overwhelming love for him. He gives vent to his resultant joy, in this decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro97&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bliss enjoyed by the Āḻvār in this decad, stands on a pedestal of its own. It can even be asserted that there is no comparable decad in the whole hymnal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When one pauses and ponders which indeed is the greater of the two pulls, namely, the Lord’s effort to get at the Āḻvār and the Āḻvār’s desire to get at Him, it will be seen that the Lord exerts the greater, naturally, the stronger pull, His desire to get at the subject, His coveted belonging, being supreme. Did He not declare, in His ‘Song Celestial’, that the gnostic, who knows Him truly, is undoubtedly responsible for His very existence and that it is very hard to find a truly discerning devotee who looks upon Him as everything, the highest goal, the Sole Means, Father, Mother, Friend. Refuge, Resting place etc.? It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the Lord considers it His greatest gain to reclaim a Jīva (individual soul) and, to this end, He goes on preparing the ground, all the time. His intense longing to get at the individual Soul is virtually the copper plate, establishing His right of ownership over the subject, sought to be reclaimed. And, therefore, the Lord mingles with the Āḻvār with such an inordinate longing. Noticing this, the Āḻvār realises with a stinging sense of shame that he had tried to reverse the role by begging of the Lord for his redemption overlooking the fact that it was the Lord who was all along been the supplicant for the Āḻvār’s love unto Hirn. The Āḻvār acknowledges in this decad with great feeling the enormous love bestowed by the Lord on the individual Soul, as the indefatigable cultivator of God-love in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro98&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the fifth decad of this centum (Māyak kūttā), the Āḻvār’s yearning was too deep for words. The Lord responded with even greater avidity and the two of them got wrapt up in mutual delight. The Āḻvār gave vent to his jubilation in the last decad, and even so, in the eighth song of that decad, he referred to himself as a frail being, with whom the great Lord of unlimited prowess has chosen to mingle freely and stay on. The Āḻvār’s frightful sense of his own pettiness, in contra-distinction to the Lord’s grandeur of limitless dimensions, which was rearing up its head now and then, was studiously kept under effective check by the Lord who was apprehensive of the Āḻvār’s tendency to shrink back from Him on this score. The Lord, who noticed, with great concern, a revival of this trend in the Āḻvār, wished to cut it out, there and then, root and branch. The Lord wanted to quell the Āḻvār’s notion of the soul’s pettiness by revealing to him its real grandeur. But then, the soul, like unto a mere glow-worm, may not hold out any appeal to the Āḻvār, profoundly struck by the Lord’s exquisite charm. The other alternative for the Lord was to exhibit the grandeur of the Āḻvār‘s soul along with that of His own. The Lord accordingly revealed to the Āḻvār, His charm first and then the grandeur of the Āḻvār’s soul, in its relation of liegeship to the Sovereign Lord, as delectable unto Him as His ornaments. And so, in this decad, the Āḻvār dwells on the intrinsic beauty of the soul, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord, as revealed by the Lord Himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro99&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This decad is spelt out by a mate of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (Āḻvār, figuratively turned into a female lover). In the entire hymnal, there are three decads of this type and this is the last of the series, the two earlier ones being IV-6 and VI-5. In IV-6, the mate advised the elders, gathered around Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, who were treading the mis-guided path of invoking minor deities to cure the Nāyakī’s malady, to desist from their wrong methods and smear the Nāyakī’s body with the dust from the feet of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas. In VI-5, it may be recalled, the mates pointed out to the elders, the futility of their trying to extricate the Nāyakī, completely absorbed in the Deity at Tolaivillimaṅkalam, having committed the initial mistake of taking her to that pilgrim centre and then brought her face to face with the Deity there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro910&#34;&gt;00 Intro9.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subject’s exclusive dependence on the Supreme Lord was emphasised in the last decad. But then, dependence on the Lord could extend upto the Lord’s devotees as well by virtue of His unbounded love for them. This is like our wearing on our heads, the holy sandals of the Lord and swallowing the water obtained by giving them a sacramental bath. Did not Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār declare in VIII-10-3 of his ‘Periya Tirumoḻi’ that, as a result of learning the eight-syllabled Tirumantra, he became a vassal of the devotees of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkaṇṇapuram? Service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical culmination of service to the Lord (which is implied in the word ‘namaḥ’, occurring in Tirumantra), is dealt with, in this decad. Actually, the end-song of the last decad has already set the pace for this decad. No doubt, the essential nature of the soul, with special emphasis on servanthood (śeṣatva), as the Lord’s vassal, extending upto the Lord’s devotees, was set out, as far back as III-7 ‘Payilum Cuṭaroḷi’. We, however, see in this decad, the Āḻvār intensely longing for the fulfilment of such service, constituting the final goal. Being the liege unto the Lord’s favourite apostles and Saints on Earth is deemd to be a greater virtue, carrying to greater value than direct allegiance to the Lord Himself. In ‘Īṭu’, mention has been made of an anecdote, shedding copious light on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
