      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro21&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last stanza of the preceding decad, the Āḻvār who had already conjured up the vision of the Lord as having entered his body and gone right up to his head, referred to the Lord as the blue gem, overlord of the Celestials and a very attractive jewel, by himself. Each one of these features of the Lord was so fascinating that the Āḻvār could not resist the immediate urge to enjoy them outwardly. The enjoyment, longed for, did not, however, materialise instantly and the Āḻvār was thrown into a state of deep dejection, reduced to the abject position of a forlorn lover. The Āḻvār, thus transformed into a female lover (Parāṇkuśa Nāyakī), pining for her beloved Lord, moves into a garden on the sea-shore to bemoan her separation. It may be recalled that she was in a similar predicament earlier, when she sent the birds etc, as her emissaries to the Lord-See 1-4. But then, she is worse off now, not finding any one to carry her message to the Lord. The self-same stork which she had commissioned earlier now looms in her eyes as a comrade-in-distress. The stork’s natural complexion is white but the Āḻvār thinks that it is a case of decoloration due to the pangs of separation from the Lord, experienced by it. The Aṉṟil birds of opposite sex always stay together and even during sleep keep their bills locked in each other‘s mouth. The moment the bills get unlocked, they wake up and start crying. Unaware of this natural sequence, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī thinks that these birds cry out their agony of separation from the Lord, like her. The wind, ever on the move, appears to the Āḻvār to go about frantically in search of the Lord; the clouds, unleashing rain-water, look like shedding tears of grief due to separation from the Lord; likewise, the waning of the Moon, the surging, up and down, of the waves, the burning of the lamp and all other natural phenomena are invested by the love-lorn Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī with her own poignancy and she bemoans their lot as well. This sets the pace and pattern of this decad, pin pointing the Lord’s quality of making his devotees mad with God-love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro22&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār was confined to the bottom-most depth of dejection and his yearning for the Lord baffled description. It was but meet that the Lord came and presented Himself before such an ardent devotee and saved him from collapsing altogether. It goes without saying that, when the Āḻvār came, face to face, with the Lord, all his erstwhile dejection and the resultant fatigue vanished altogether. The Āḻvār then made up his mind not to allow himself to be swept off once again, by contemplating the Lord’s trait of ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility). He would rather tackle the other plank, safe and steady, namely, the Lord’s overlordship and transcendent glory and sustain himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro23&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first decad of this centum, we saw the Āḻvār in dire distress. Towards the end, the Lord, however, deigned to present Himself and once again, the Āḻvār is in rapturous rapport with the Lord. In this decad, he gives vent to the joy of reunion with the enchanting Lord. In strict sequence, this should have been the second decad instead of being the third. The Āḻvār’s immediate reaction, on seeing the Lord come back to him, was, however, that one of such super eminence, the overlord of the Celestials, should have at all deigned to mingle with one so low. And, therefore, he straightaway expatiated on the Lord’s transcendental glory, in the second decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro24&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the penultimate song of the last decad the Āḻvār expressed his desire to sing profusely the glory of the Lord in a chorus. Looking around, he, however, found the prospect of mustering persons from the rank and file of the worldlings for this purpose pretty bleak. He had, therefore, no option but to shift the venue of his enjoyment to the high Heavens and sing the Lord’s praise in the company of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ there. This ardent longing of the Āḻvār was, however, not realised there and then and once again the Āḻvār was thrown into deep dejection assuming the overtones of a frustrated feminine lover in a state of despondency. The Āḻvār had got into such a state on two earlier occasions, namely I-4 and II-1. On the first occasion he sent some birds as his emissaries to the Lord, while, on the second occasion, all things around seemed to suffer, like him, the pangs of separation from the Lord and he, therefore, wept along with those comrades-in-distress. But now his grief is so deep and poignant that all that is said in this decad is put in the mouth of the mother who questions the Lord how He could reduce her love-intoxicated daughter to such a parlous state and asks Him to clarify His intentions as to what exactly He proposes to do about the poor little victim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro25&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sufferings undergone by the Āḻvār, as set out in the last decad, are comparable to the titanic struggle of Gajendra, the elephant, with the crocodile. Even as the Lord rushed, with an aching heart, to the pond post-haste on hearing the alarum raised by the elephant the Lord felt exceedingly remorseful that He did not rush to meet the Āḻvār as soon as the latter became critical of His nonchalance, that is, His not rushing to his aid despite His having the mighty Garuḍa to carry Him anywhere at supersonic speed. See II-4-4. By way of making amends for this remissness, the Lord has now come to the Āḻvār, in all His splendour and paraphernalia and is at the height of His joy in the blessed company of the Saint. Beholding the joyous Lord, the Saint feels immensely delighted and relates, in this decad, his ecstatic experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro26&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As set out, in the last decad, the Āḻvār is experiencing the Supreme bliss of Union with the Lord, like Heaven transplanted right here. And what about the Lord? In the supreme joy of His union with the Āḻvār, the Lord, is exploring new avenues of regaling him as well as those associated with him. What a fine reciprocity?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In II-3, the Āḻvār pined, for the company of the Lord’s devotees and now the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār extends to his devotees as well. But at the same time. He also apprehends the possibility of the Āḻvār slipping back to his old ways and shrinking away from Him, overwhelmed by His transcendent glory. The Āḻvār feels the Lord’s pulse all right and hastens to assure Him that he would not give up his Lord on any account and that his present grip on Him is very tight indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro27&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the seventh stanza of the last decad, the Āḻvār had mentioned that the Lord’s benevolent grace did not stop with him alone but overflowed its continents and extended to all those connected with him in the preceding and succeeding generations as well. Overwhelmed by this extraordinary benevolence of the Lord the Āḻvār expatiates on it in this decad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the numerous auspicious traits of the Lord extension of His love and care not only to His devotees but all those associated with them, is indeed exemplary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro28&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār was overwhelmed by the Lord’s extraordinary benevolence which did not stop with him aloṇe but overflowed its continents and extended to those connected with him, seven generations, back and forth. In other words, the heavenly bliss enjoyed by the ‘&lt;em&gt;Nityās&lt;/em&gt;’ in Heaven could be shared by him and his associates, right here. In his boundless compassion for the suffering humanity, caught up in the vortex of worldly life and sensual pleasures, the Āḻvār would naturally like to seize this golden opportunity and get the area of benevolence extended, by getting the ‘&lt;em&gt;Samsārīs&lt;/em&gt;’ (worldlings) also associated with him as fellow-devotees. And so, he turns round and advises them to get into the Divine fold, seeing that the Lord is the one and only granter of Mokṣa, the final bliss, ridding them of the terrific involvement in worldly life, with its dreadful cycle of birth and death. It may be recalled that, once before, vide 1-2, the Āḻvār addressed the fellowbeings with whom he wished to share all that exalted knowledge about the Divine order, imparted to him by a self-revealing God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro29&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This decad pinpoints the concept of ‘&lt;em&gt;Puriṣārtha&lt;/em&gt;’ the ultimate value of the final goal of every individual. In the preceding decad, frequent references were made by the Āḻvār to the Eternal Land of absolute bliss. On hearing these, the Lord thought He would rather put the Āḻvār in Heaven if that was all His desire and accordingly told him, “Well, you can have the Mokṣa, as desired”, It is now and here that the position gets crystallised. The Āḻvār revolves in his mind and concludes that any thing granted by the Lord, by way of catering to his desire instead of His own, is not worth having, and even heaven attained this way, would be little better than hell. The real ‘&lt;em&gt;Puruṣārtḥa&lt;/em&gt;’, or ultimate value lies in whatever is bestowed by the Lord out of His own free grace and liking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro210&#34;&gt;00 Intro2.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār stressed the need for quick action on the part of the Lord, while praying that He should take service from him, at all times. The Āḻvār’s agitation for expeditious result was, however, construed by the Lord as the Āḻvār’s desire to serve in this body itself and He, therefore, directed the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Iconic Form in Tirumāliruñcōlai malai (very near to Maturai in the South), a nice, quiet place, abounding in lovely hills and beautiful orchards. The Āḻvār accordingly enjoys alike the pilgrim centre and the Lord enshrined there, his predilections extending even to the other hills, in and around, and the very route leading thereto.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
