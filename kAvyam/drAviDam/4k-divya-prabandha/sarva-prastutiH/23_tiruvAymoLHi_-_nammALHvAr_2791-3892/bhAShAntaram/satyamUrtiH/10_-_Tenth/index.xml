      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro101&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The declaration, made by the Saint in the preceding decad, that the Lord is the great Benefactor Who would grant ‘Mokṣa’ (eternal emancipation) when this body of ours falls off, is with reference to the clear assurance given to him by the Lord, to this effect. What looked earlier like an indefinite prospect has now acquired a concrete shape, time-bound, the farthest limit being the fall of the body at the end of the current span of life. Well, that he was fast nearing the end of his soul’s journey, the Āḻvār was quite conscious of. His body had worn out to an extent that gave clear indication of its falling off very soon and the Āḻvār knew quite well that the day of his promised ascent to Heaven was near at hand. So then, the Āḻvār set about preparing for the final lap of his journey to the Celestium and sought the good offices of the Lord, in His worshippable form at Tirumōkūr, to escort him through. Finding the Lord at Tirumōkūr, as the super-abundant Benefactor, with profound knowledge and prowess, capable of steering through all obstacles, the Āḻvār got hold of Him as the unfailing escort, during his onward march to yonder Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro102&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this decad, the Āḻvār lauds the glory of the Lord, in His worshippable form at Tiruvaṉantapuram (in Kerala State). As we go on, we will find the Āḻvār calling successively at the holy centres of Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Tirumāliruñcōlai, Tiruppēr and adoring the Lord enshrined in those places. A similar treatment is noticeable in the case of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār also. He is found calling on the Lords of many holy places, all of them in a single decad of the tenth Centum (X-l) of his grand apocalypse (Periya Tirumoḻi). When asked by Nañcīyar to elucidate this visiting spree on the part of that Āḻvār, Bhaṭṭārya brought home the import, in a very telling manner. He said: “Don’t you know, Son, when a girl is given in marriage, there comes a time when she has to leave her parental roof for that of her husband and that it is but natural that she then goes about visiting her relations and friends at this end, to take leave of them. So does the Āḻvār, as the time for departing to Heaven draws near; on the eve of his departure from this abode, he takes leave of the Lord in His worshippable form, at the various shrines over here, who did, as a matter of fact, instil and enrich his love for God in Heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro103&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār, who longed, in the preceding song, for the felicity of divine service unto the Lord at Tiru-Aṉantapuram, accompanied by the pious band of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, was struck down by a deep sense of frustration, when his aspiration did not materialise. So deep was his frustration indeed, that it led him to suspect the frightful possibility of the Lord perpetuating his bondage and prolonging his stay in this abode. Of course, such an apprehension is not out of place, when one sees the notoriety of the material contact (body), with its great potentiality for mischief, on the one hand, and the Lord’s unbridled independence (Svātantarya), on the other. The Āḻvār, however, expresses his apprehension, in an indirect way in this decad, instead of putting it to the Lord point-blank. He cloaks his own misgivings by referring to the misgivings, entertained by the shepherdesses of Virundāvan, who started nagging Kṛṣṇa, the naughty cow-herd boy, even in the early hours of the morning, the pre-dawn period. No doubt, He was still lying in bed on the crucial morning but He used to leave his bed, by about this time, and take the cattle out for the pasture. The same sequence prevails this morning also, that is, the cool breeze is blowing, the Koels have started cooing, the peacocks are strutting about and the herds of cows and calves are seen spread out, all over the place. So great is His loving care for the Cattle that He would surely follow and tend them, relegating to the background His concern for the Gopis who cannot, however, brook His separation, even for a short while. And so, the Gopīs conclude that Kṛṣṇa would not make any exception on this particular morning and stay behind. Their minds get agitated over the certainty of Kṛṣṇa’s departure from their midst, to such an extent that they start experiencing the pangs of separation even when He is very much by their side. One of them would lustily plead with Him that He shall not leave them and go out into the fields, firstly, because they cannot bear being apart from Him for a whole day, which actually looms like ages in their aching minds, and secondly, because of the lurking danger to His life at the hands of Kaṃsa’s evil spies and agents who keep on masquerading, in one form or another, all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro104&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār suffered the pangs of separation from the Lord, akin to those experienced by the Gopīs, even when the Lord was in their midst. Just as the Gopīs were placated by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār was pacified by the Lord and his fears were quelled when the Lord assured him that He would no longer get parted from him. Rid of the fear of prolongation of his bondage, the Āḻvār is now jubilant over the near prospect of his ascent to the Lord’s feet in Heaven. He, therefore, gets busy in giving the finishing touches, appropriate to this grand hymnal of unparalleled sweetness and grandeur. He has begun to realise the fruits of the devotion (Bhakti), preached by him to others, right from I-2 and onwards. It may be recalled that Rāvaṇa turned a deaf ear to Vibhīṣaṇa’s pious entreaty and advice but it only intensified the latter’s devotion which led him on to Rāma’s camp itself. This decad sets out how God is attainable through love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro105&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was out of deep compassion of unique dimensions that Saint Nammāḻvār did, in the midst of his mystic experience, &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, turn his attention on the people around, from time to time, in order to turn them God-ward. No doubt, he found them distressingly unresponsive and at one stage (&lt;em&gt;vide&lt;/em&gt; stanza 25 of “Periya Tiruvantāti”, the third of Nammāḻvār’s four hymnals), he observed that it would be next to impossible to wean away the worldlings, the incorrigibles and make them God-bent. And yet, so great was his tender solicitude that he went on exhorting them to realise the utter futility of worldly possessions and sensual pleasures and take refuge at the lovely feet of the Supreme Lord, Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, the surest and the easiest way of securing release from the bondage of ‘Saṃsāra We could see this great gesture of the Āḻvār, in every centum of this grand hymnal, from I-2 onwards. This is, however, the last decad in which he tenders advice to the world around and a little hence, we will see him marching to heaven through the exalted and exhilarating route, known as the ‘Arcirādhi mārga’, the route of great distinction, earmarked for the released souls, heaven-bound. It is characteristic of the magnanimous elders of great eminence to say a few golden words, on the eve of their exit from this world, by way of parting advice to the near and dear ones around. The Āḻvār, who is overwhelmingly conscious of the Lord’s eagerness to lift him up to His Heavenly abode and the almost immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven, tenders such parting advice in this decad, the very last of the series of lectures, delivered by him, for the edification and elevation of the earth-bound, sense-buried men of the world, c.f. Vibhīṣaṇa’s advice to Rāvaṇa, even while leaving Laṅkā, bound for Lord Rāma’s Camp—“na naśyanthaṃ upekṣeyam pradīptam śaraṇam yadhā” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, VI.16.22).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro106&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the great Nampiḷḷai would put it, in his inimitable diction, the stage has now been reached when the Lord is in hot pursuit of the Āḻvār. The position hitherto, commencing from the opening song of the Āḻvār’s first hymnal (Tiruviruttam) was, however, just the reverse, that is, the Āḻvār was seeking out the Lord and pursuing Him doggedly. The Āḻvār, who was the supplicant before, is now vigorously sought after by the Lord Whose love for the great savant knows no bounds, vide the 3rd song of this decad, which highlights the speed with which the Lord wishes to take the Āḻvār, to the heavenly abode. In the exuberance of His love for the Āḻvār, the Lord would even think in terms of lifting him bodily to heaven. The Āḻvār had to plead with the Lord to give up His overambitious project and he advised Him not to defile the sanctity of Heaven by introducing therein his physical body. What is even more astounding is the Lord’s extreme fascination for the Āḻvār’s physical body, the last of the staggering number of bodies, tenanted by him, that led Him on to seek the Āḻvār’s permission to enjoy his body, limb by limb. For this purpose, the Lord would assume a number of Forms, as He did during the famous ‘&lt;em&gt;RĀSAKRĪḌĀ&lt;/em&gt;’ dance with the damsels of Vrindāvan and again, when He married sixteen thousand pretty ladies and led the life of a typical householder with each one of them, all at once, in the holy island of Dvāraka, a township raised by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself from the bed of the Sea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro107&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw the Āḻvār bursting with joy in the last decad. The Lord, Who stuck fast to the Āḻvār’s heart, would now want to get hold of the Āḻvār’s entire physical frame, limb by limb, like unto the flies swarming, in and around the jack-fruit. Well, what is the Lord’s fascination for this elemental body, which the gnostics (Jñānis) have no hesitation in condemning as foul and are ready to give up, any moment? The sweet aroma of spiritual awakening, emanating from the Jñāni’s body is indeed very pleasing to the Lord, Who, therefore, covets him and adores him, in that mortal frame, with all its dirt and stench, like unto the erotic lover doting on the body of his beloved, unmindful of its drawbacks. Do not the ladies wear, on their locks, the fragrant root, dug out of the earth, without shaking off the earthen particles of dust, lest it should diminish the fragrance?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro108&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the sixth decad of this centum, the Lord was indeed in great hurry to take the Āḻvār to Heaven but His speed got somewhat arrested, in the last decad, due to His passionate love for the Āḻvār’s physical frame as well and His resultant desire to lift him up bodily to Heaven. The Āḻvār had to do quite a bit of talking and impress upon the Lord, the non-feasibility of his ascent to Heaven, in this physical body and ultimately the Lord had to yield.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro109&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār had put the Lord, a very inconvenient question and thereby put Him in quite an embarrassing predicament. Shorn of all quibblings, the Lord would have had to say, in reply, that it was in the exercise of His unbridled independence that He had kept the Āḻvār, deep down in the mire of Saṃsāra for ages, and now, invoking the self-same trait of His, He has been pleased to extend all the favours, currently enjoyed by the Āḻvār. It would, however, be hardly appropriate for Him to say so, especially at this crucial juncture. For Him, it was now a veritable battle of wits and He skilfully tried to tide over this unenviable situation, rather, cover it up by calling upon the clouds and the oceans to roar like an orchestra, heralding the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven and the inhabitants of all the seven islands to bestow on him their choicest offerings. This is how the errant priest, officiating at marriage ceremonies, covers up his inadvertent mistakes in regard to the recital of the Mantras, that is, mixing up the wrong texts pertaining to the funeral obsequies, in between. On such occasions, which might, of course, be few and far between, the clever priest covers his awkwardness by vociferously commanding the piper and the drummer to play their notes in a crescendo, thereby drowning his egregious blunder in that babel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro1010&#34;&gt;00 Intro10.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was indeed a rude jolt to the Āḻvār, who was shocked into a sense of stark reality, when he opened his eyes and found that he was still seated where he was, namely, the hollow inside the trunk of the tamarind tree, in the precincts of Lord Ādinātha’s temple in Āḻvār Tirunakari. It now transpired to him that his ascent to heaven, through the exhilarating ‘Arcirādi mārga’, the honours lavished on him by the various agencies all along the route and at the destination, his stay in the midst of the ‘Nityās’ and ‘Muktās’ in the gem-set hall, where the Lord and His Divine Consort were holding Durbar, all these, expatiated on by him in the preceding decad, were but the figments of his imagination, a mere mental comprehension and nothing more. Eaten up by the cruel pangs of frustration at that he is still lingering in the unenviable mesh of ‘Prakṛti’ (matter), the Āḻvār now cries out his heart unto the Lord, in a manner that is bound to melt even those utterly devoid of tenderness of heart. Oh, what a pity! the Lord, who is fully aware of the Āḻvār’s utter helplessness and sole dependence on Him, has chosen to keep him still tethered to the material body. Like unto the suckling, tormented by deep thirst and pinching hunger, despite the parents being near at hand, crying out lustily, the Āḻvār calls out the Lord. Voicing forth his deep yearning with the utmost effort, like the full-throated call for relief from one engulfed by wild fire, the Āḻvār compels the immediate attention and succour of the Lord. It would indeed be well-nigh impossible for the Lord, at this stage, to stick to His seat in Heaven anymore, without responding to the ardent call of a devotee of the calibre of Nammāḻvār.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
