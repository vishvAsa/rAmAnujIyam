      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro31&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end-stanza of the preceding decad, the Āḻvār had referred to himself as one possessed of a clear vision, absolutely free from doubt and despair, discrepancies and deviations. But in the very next song, that is, the first song of this decad, he seeks clarification of certain doubts and thus betrays his ignorance. Well, ignorance is of four different kinds, namely (1) &lt;em&gt;Non-comprehension&lt;/em&gt;. (2) &lt;em&gt;comprehension, halfway beset with doubts&lt;/em&gt;, (3) &lt;em&gt;miscomprehension and&lt;/em&gt; (4) &lt;em&gt;lapse of memory resulting in not remembering a thing previously known&lt;/em&gt;. In the present case, the Āḻvār is assailed by doubts and yet, it transcends the above types of ignorance to which those still relatively unevolved and in the grip of nescience resulting from Karma, are susceptible. Here it is the bewitching splendour of Lord Aḻakar which defies description and baffles correct and complete comprehension. Enthralled by the charming personality of the Lord, the Āḻvār enquires of the Lord, “Sire, has the effulgence of your face expanded itself upwards into the dazzling crown and Your dazzling feet likewise expanded into the lotus seat on which they are poised?” It is the exuberance of their God-love, too deep for words, that throws the Āḻvārs into an ecstatic state of mental imbalance and this only redounds to their glory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro32&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have only to imagine the pangs of a person unable to quench his extreme thirst, notwithstanding the availability of plenty of water near at hand, just because his mouth is sealed up (like Tantalus in the Greek legend). We will then be able to appreciate the most unenviable predicament in which the Āḻvār found himself, suffering from the figurative lock-jaw. Here is the Lord in His worshiṛpable form, of insatiable beauty, near at hand, and yet, the Āḻvār is not able to comprehend and enjoy Him as well as He would like to, severely handicapped as he is, by the heavy limitations inherent in his earthly existence, tethered to this material body. No doubt, the Lord, in His unbounded mercy, has dowered on us limbs and sense-organs to impart mobility and put us on a career of gainful activity. Not stopping with this alone, He condescended to present Himself before the Subjects during His Avatāras and mixed with them freely. And yet, all these benefits do not currently fill the Āḻvār’s bill. On the other hand, he is regretting his inability to enjoy the Lord, in His ‘Arcā’ (Iconic manifestation), &lt;em&gt;in toto&lt;/em&gt;, and give the fullest expression to such enjoyment. God is limitless but the Saint has his limitations although his craving is very great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro33&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār prayed to the Lord that his body, the material shackle, which stood in the way of his enjoyment of the Lord, be cut out. But then, the Lord pacified the Āḻvār by pointing out that this body of the Āḻvār in which the Lord eventually got hold of him was by-no-means an impediment, as he thought it to be. On the other hand, He literally coveted him, in that very body, and very much desired to take service from him, in his present embodied state. And so, the Lord beckoned the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Arcā Form at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. Against this background the Āḻvār seeks to render blemishless service unto the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam in ever so many ways, without break, even as a person, feeling the pinch of hunger and with the food packet in hand, sets the table as soon as he comes across a suitable spot with shade and water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro34&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār was all agog to serve the Lord, at all times and in every conceivable manner, without break or blemish. Profoundly impressed by the intensity of the Āḻvār’s yearning for Divine service, the Lord very much wished to make his task easy and so threw into focus His unique faculty of omnipresence, &lt;em&gt;pervading all things, all over&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;at all times&lt;/em&gt;. Coming face to face with the Lord’s immense ubiquity in various forms, the Āḻvār was in the same predicament as the one gathering the fruits dropped down the trees in a violent gale, finding it difficult to pick and choose. The phenomenon before him was so amazing and of such astounding dimensions that the Āḻvār, who resorted to singing the Lord’s glory (which is also a form of service, namely, service by word of mouth—Vācika Kaiṅkarya), just didn’t know where to begin and what to say. It is the Lord’s immanence that the Āḻvār attempted to sing about, in this decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro35&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, we saw the Āḻvār enjoying the Lord’s immanence in quite a marvellous way. So ecstatic and love-smitten did he become on beholding the Lord’s ‘Vibhūti’, vast and varied, immense and interesting, defying description, that he was thrown into the rapturous state of singing and dancing. One has only to witness a Saint in his moments of rapturous ravishment in union with God, moments when his whole being thrills with love and his eyes swim with the pearls of tears of delight. This also reflects the behaviour of the exalted denizens of the high heavens, who drink deep incessantly from that inexhaustible fountain of bliss, the Lord. No wonder then, Sage Nārada and other celestial bards always dance as they sing, and sing as they dance, in the immediate presence of the Lord, completely swayed by God-love of extraordinary intensity. As a matter of fact, the hands and feet as well as the other limbs, graciously dowered on us by the Lord, can prove their worth only in this way. Naturally, the Āḻvār felt disappointed, rather distressed when he found that, barring a handful, the bulk of the worldlings around was very far from such intoxicating God-love. While he is all praises for the few kindred souls, he is unsparing in his condemnation of the otherwise. This provides the theme of this decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro36&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār extolled the devotees thrown into a state of ecstasy, enraptured by the contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, moving about, all the time singing and dancing. In the same breath he spoke disparagingly of those who do not exhibit this kind of behaviour but remain callously indifferent, unmoved by and impervious to the glory of the Lord. But then, the Āḻvār, known for his deep compassion and love for the fellow-beings, wished to bring round even those in the latter category and impress, in their mind, the Lord’s extraordinary trait of tender solicitude and easy accessibility. No doubt, the Āḻvār had already expatiated on this in 1-3, but that was in terms of the Lord’s incarnations (Vibhava aspect). And now, in this decad, the Āḻvār expounds the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’ easy accessibility in His Iconic Form which is not only the most easily accessible but also the very embodiment of every known and conceivable good quality in a perfect measure, a complete enumeration whereof would be beyond the capacity of the omniscient Lord Himself. Verily, the Lord’s Arcā (Iconic) manifestation is the very acme, the farthest limit of His wonderful trait of ‘Saulabhya’. Nampiḷḷai likens the Āḻvār’s great gesture to that of Sītā, the captive in Laṅkā, who tendered wholesome advice to the lustful Rāvaṇa who desired to have promiscuous relation with the Divine Mother, mistaking her for a mere woman. Even as the Āḻvār made no secret of his vexation, in the last decad, of callous indifference and aloofness of men devoid of God-love, Sītā too got vexed with Rāvaṇa’s amorous advances and the dearth of wholesome counsellors in the land, who could bring round this fiend of a fellow, terribly love-smitten. But, being grace personified, she herself counselled him to befriend Rāma and avoid a gruesome death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro37&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite his earlier disappointments, it was his extraordinary fellow-feeling that egged the Āḻvār on, to address the worldlings once more, as in the last decad, pretty sure of bringing them round. Even the amazing simplicity of the Lord in His ‘Arcā’ manifestation, the sure plank, according to the Āḻvār, for weaning them, made no visible impact on the unfortunate fellows wallowing in the sty of worldly life, much to the chagrin of the Āḻvār. The Āḻvār, however, drowns his disappointment, in this decad in the blissful contemplation of service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical conclusion of service unto the Lord, in keeping with the essential nature of the Individual soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro38&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While trying to sustain himself by recounting the glory of the Bhāgavatas (Lord’s devotees), as in the last decad, the Lord’s glorious traits and wondrous deeds were also dwelt upon, side by side, in each stanza of that decad, in view of the irresistible appeal of the latter. It may also be recalled that, in III-6-10 we could notice the Āḻvār’s deep anxiety to behold the Lord’s pair of legs dangling down the chariot on the battlefield at Kurukṣetra. And now, the other sense-organs of the Āḻvār compete with the eyes in the enjoyment of God. Each one of the Āḻvār’s senses, limbs and faculties, would appear to have acquired intelligence, the stature of sentient beings, on a par with the Āḻvār’s soul, with the result that there is the competitive exuberance on the part of the Āḻvār and his anatomical parts, come to life and capacitated for independent action, to get at the Lord individually and in the quickest possible manner and time. And, what is even more exciting is, each faculty aspires to transcend its functional limitations, resulting in an overlapping of functions as well. The hands would want to praise the Lord, the ears would long to drink deep of His nectarcan charm, the eyes would like to offer Him fruits and flowers, so on and so forth. Each sense yearning for the delight experienced by the other senses, is a very extraordinary state of affairs indeed! Does not the snake which does not have ears, as such, see and hear through the eyes only, the eyes performing the dual function of seeing and hearing, though not simultaneously? Again, the up-grading of the senses and limbs to the stature of sentient beings can only be compared to the Āḻvār being described, now and then, as melting down or getting dried up or cut into pieces, although the soul is beyond the mischief of the elements, cannot be burnt out by fire or drenched by water, or dried up by air or cleaved by weapons—vide Bhagavad Gītā 11-23 and 24.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro39&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Among the myriads of the Lord’s Creatures the human form is a rare gift of the Lord. Even so, the human form, thus dowered, has to be free from physical and mental handicaps. Even then, acquisition of a high degree of learning is rare and rarer still is the capacity for writing Verses. And then again, this extremely rare gift of verse-making has to be put to proper use but, more often than not, this talent is prostituted for the poet’s selfish ends, by indulging in praise of the petty humans, as, for example, the Sanskrit work, entitled ‘Pratāpa Rudrīyam [Rudṛyaṃ]’. The Āḻvār naturally deplores such misguided poets and advises them to give up their low base and elevate themselves to their legitimate stature, as the Lord’s bards, soaring high, singing exclusively His great glory, in beautiful, meTical compositions. The Āḻvār mostly bemoans his separation from the Lord during those moments when communion with Him gets snapped, for one reason or another. But now and then, he turns his attention on the worldlings around, moved by their sad plight. In this decad, he exhorts the poets to harness their literary excellence to useful purpose by singing the many auspicious traits and wondrous deeds of the Lord and not to go the wrong way, eulogising the frail humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro310&#34;&gt;00 Intro3.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lord is most eminently suited for laudation by virtue of His innumerable auspicious traits, wondrous deeds and vast possessions. And yet, the worldlings would not listen to the Āḻvār’s advice, as in the preceding decad, to praise Him exclusively and desist from praising others. The Āḻvār, however, felt happy that he could at least get back from them unscathed without following in their footsteps. That spirit of complacence tuns through this decad also with an extra gusto. The Āḻvār gives expression to the various benefits accrued to him through his total absorption in the Lord, namely, full and complete freedom from (1) want, (2) obstruction in the enjoyment of the Lord, (3) trouble, (4) sorrow, (5) affliction. (6) hindrance, (7) fatigue etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
