      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro51&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through his brilliant exposition of the Lord’s Supremacy, in the last decad, the Āḻvār could wean away the worldlings from propitiating the minor deities and turn their attention to the Supreme Lord (Viṣṇu). The Āḻvār is about to sing the song of benediction for the new state of affairs to flourish in all its glory, vide V-2. Meanwhile, he draws the searchlight inwards to examine the root-cause of the extraordinary grace showered on him by the Lord, whereby he could not merely stand apart from the worldlings without wallowing as one of them, but also advise and correct them. This introspection, however, reveals that even for a mere show of piety by him devoid of genuine love for God, He has condescended to open up the floodgates of His grace on him, without caring in the least to go beneath the skin and expose his hollowness. The Āḻvār just marvels at the Lord’s overwhelming grace and gives vent to his wonderment, in this decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro52&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In IV-10, the Āḻvār preached to the world at large the Supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in convincing style and thereby weaned the people from propitiating minor deities. The resultant upsurge of devotion to the Supreme Lord converted this abode into a land of bliss, hardly distinguishable from Heaven. This again resulted in a free flow of visitors from Heaven and other upper regions to this land, to behold and admire this new state of affairs. A golden era having thus been ushered in, the Āḻvār hails it in this decad. He also envisaged, with a prophetic vision, the happy preservation and propagation of God-love thus generated, in the coming ages as well, through the advent of the illustrious Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Saint Rāmānujācārya, the veritable destroyers of the evil forces of Kaliyuga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro53&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Āḻvār now reverts to the state that obtained in IV-8 and is all agog to get united with the Lord. Non-fulfilment of his intense longing, however, induces him to contemplate the drastic step of coming into the open and carrying his tale of woe to the public at large so that the unresponsive Lord could be arraigned at the bar of public opinion and the union with Him got accelerated. It might be recalled that Śrī Rāma who had invoked the King of the oceans, got furious, when the latter didn’t turn up, and bade Lakṣmaṇa to bring unto Him the bow, so that the entire ocean could be dried up for the monkey battalions to walk through to the other shore. The frustrated Āḻvār is also likewise poised to negative God-head altogether, if the union longed for, so intensely, by him cannot materialise, there and then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro54&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to put through the proceedings contemplated by the Nāyakī in the preceding decad, she has to first of all draw a sketch of her lover (the accused) for public exhibition and arraignment. But it is pitch dark and she can’t draw the picture. It seems as if the Lord is afraid of being exposed by the Nāyakī and has deliberately induced darkness of such intensity, The whole world is fast asleep, and she has no company. In such a milieu, she has recourse to the contemplation ofthe Lord’s auspicious traits, soothing indeed unto her aching heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro55&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār felt miserably handicapped by darkness and dew, the inner meaning whereof is that this land of nescience is enveloped in ‘tamas’ or darkness. The Nāyakī’s irresistible urge for the speedy attainment of the Lord, witnessed in V-3 (Mācu aṟu cōti), violently disturbed her firm conviction in the Lord as the Sole Means for attaining Him and made her contemplate the devious indulgence in self—effort, such as embarking on the technique of ‘maṭal’. The dark, dewy night, presented in V-4 (Ūrellām tuñci), only typifies the Saṃsāra, with its characteristic nescience, into which one is thrown back, when one loses track of one’s essential nature and with that, the correct perspective. In śloka 49 of the ‘Stotra Ratna’, Saint Yāmunācārya only echoed this, when he likened a person, entangled in ‘Saṃsāra’, to one badly caught up in foul weather, with dark, dense clouds gathering in, losing the sense of direction, beaten continually by ever-expanding miseries pouring in like the torrential rain. The sun-rise symbolises the removal of darkness, that is, ignorance and the influx of spiritual light (Satva) or purity. The Āḻvār could, with the return of light, enjoy, in his mind’s eye, the glorious vision of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro56&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mother finds Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, seated like a discourser, with the fingers in an instructional pose and declaring that it is she that created the whole world, that she would become the world herself and so on. The bewildered mother, when queried by her kinsmen says that the Nāyakī is perhaps possessed by the Supreme Lord who is the Inner Self of all beings. Every song in this decad is in two distinct parts, namely, the narration of the Nāyakī’s God-vision (man identified with God), followed by the Mother&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that it is perhaps God who has taken possession of the Nāyakī, that speaks through her. There is of course, a parallel for this kind of behaviour of the Nāyakī in Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa, V-13-23. In the midst of that rapturous balldance, the classical ‘Rāsakrīḍā’, Lord Kṛṣṇa suddenly withdrew Himself from the Gopīs of Vṛndāvan, who were literally bursting with joy in the company of the Divine cowherd boy, who danced in between every two girls, assuming ubiquity to the extent needed. The Lord’s sudden disappearance was motivated by His desire to stabilise the Gopīs’ God-enjoyment, which was at its highest ebb at that crucial moment, much beyond their capacity to bear. Some time later, He appeared in their midst back again, assuming afar more enchanting Form than before, as if to make amends for the pangs of separation inflicted on them. But what happened to the Gopīs during this interval? They were sunk deep in dejection, expressed by them in immortal songs, known as ‘Gopikā-Gītā’, Some of the Gopīs also resorted to the technique of impersonation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, so as to sustain themselves, as brought out in the Śloka of Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa, referred to above. There was a Gopī claiming to be none other than Kṛṣṇa and calling upon her mates to verify the truth of her statement from her gait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro57&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the nonce, the Āḻvār attempted to sustain himself by impersonating the Lord, even as the damsels of Vṛndāvan did, during that oppressive break in the middle of the rapturous ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’. But there, Lord Kṛṣṇa reappeared in an even more enchanting form than in the earlier session. But here, the Lord is still keeping Himself away from the Āḻvār, although, on the previous occasions, He obliged the Āḻvār with His appearance, mental vision of course, whenever the Āḻvār’s longing for such communion was far too intense. Pondering within himself, the Āḻvār apprehends that the Lord might either want him to adopt other means such as karma, Jñāna, Bhakti yogas or intend to give him up on the ground that he was pursuing other means, instead of looking upon Him, as the sole Means. The Āḻvār, therefore, hastens to clarify his true stand at the feet of the Lord, enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai. This pilgrim centre, also known as (irīvara Maṅkai, Cirīvara Maṅkalam and Nāṅkuṉēri, is deep south in the Tamiḻ Nādu. In each of the various pilgrim centres, the Lord displays one of His numerous auspicious traits prominently. In Vāṉamāmalai (Cirīvaramaṅkalam) shines, with extra-brilliance, the Lord’s generosity, whereby He gives out to the devotees seeking Him with single-minded devotion, His very feet as their Sole Refuge, (vide aphorism 163 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro58&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the Āḻvār’s intense longing for communion with the Lord enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai, at whose feet he fell like an uprooted tree and sought refuge, he was not favoured with the Lord’s presence. The Āḻvār now turns his attention to the Lord gracing Tirukkuṭantai (Kumbakonam in Tamiḻnādu), hoping that He might be intending to grant him audience at that centre. The Āḻvār is contemplating with all the fervour at his command, the enchanting prospect of the Lord casting His sweet glances at him, conversing with him and gathering him up to His bosom, in sweet embrace. Akrūra was also in such a happy reminiscent mood during his journey to Vrindāvan to fetch Kṛṣṇa to Kaṃsa’s court. Whereas Akrūra had his ambition duly fulfilled, the Āḻvār has once again met with disappointment, like Bharata who could not prevail over Śrī Rāma to get back to Ayodhya from exile. Depressed like the babe, wanting to suck milk from the mother’s breast, being denied access by the mother, the Āḻvār ends this decad on a despondent note, exclaiming that he just doesn’t know how many more pilgrim centres he has still to knock at in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro59&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A frustrated Āḻvār turns his attention on yet another pilgrim centre, named Tiruvallavāḻ (in Kerala), the coveted communion with the Lord at Tirukkuṭantai not having materialised. Even so, he couldn’t get there, being obsessed with the fragrance wafted across from there along with the breeze, the musical drone of the bees humming in the orchards over there, the vedic chantings etc. Thus stranded, &lt;em&gt;en route&lt;/em&gt;, the Āḻvār assumes the state of Nāyakī who speaks out her infatuation to her mates. Of course, it is all mental experience and no physical movement, as such, is involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro510&#34;&gt;00 Intro5.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unable to reach the holy place of Tiruvallavāḻ, the Āḻvār contemplated the Lord enshrined there, from the outskirts of the holy city, as we saw in the last decad. The Saint thought, he would sustain himself by meditating on Lord Govinda’s (Kṛṣṇa’s) auspicious traits but it made him thaw down. And so, he prays unto the Lord in this decad to grant him at least the stamina to contemplate His glory and sustain himself, even if He would not oblige him with His company. For this purpose, he turns to the Lord in His Incarnate Form (Vibhava), having failed to realise his longing for communion with the Lord in His Area (iconic) Form, in successive pilgrim centres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
