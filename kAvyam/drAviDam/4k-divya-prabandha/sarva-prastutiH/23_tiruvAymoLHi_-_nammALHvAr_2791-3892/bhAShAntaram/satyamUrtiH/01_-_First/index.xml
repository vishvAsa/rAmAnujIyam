      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro-11&#34;&gt;00 Intro 1.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Note: This work comprises ten centums, or hundred decades, each of which is called a ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, which means ‘Inspired utterance’ as well as ‘Divine speech’, the speech from the holy mouth of the Saint. This is a skilled poetic composition in which each stanza begins with the closing word of the previous stanza or the phonetic sound thereof. Unlike the other hymns of the ‘Divya Prabandha’, Tiruvāymoḻi is accorded the special status of being chanted only inside the temples or at homes when the Deity is seated for congregational worship, and not when the Deity is taken out in the streets in ceremonial precession.]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro12&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transcendental glory of the Supreme Lord, His Supremacy as the material cause as well as the efficient cause and final cause of all life and being, the fact of His being the one and only Giver, either directly or through other minor deities, whose favours their respective votaries seek. His lustrous Feet being the sure and certain means of salvation for one and all, all these having been revealed to the Saint by the Lord Himself, the Saint revelled in this blissful knowledge, in the preceding Tiruvāymoḻi. Far from being selfish and self-centred, he wanted to share all this knowledge with his fellow beings, as a matter of mutual joy and enlightenment. But, alas! he found them all steeped in worldly life, just the very reverse of what he was. And yet, He would not lose heart. Banking on their inherent capacity to discriminate between good and bad things, he now exhorts them to give up the elusive and obnoxious pleasures of worldly life, disengage themselves from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and dedicate themselves to the apprehension of the limitless wealth and splendour of the Supreme Lord and reap the rich harvest of eternal bliss and beatitude. In this decad, the Āḻvār also teaches that true renunciation is of the mind, as distinguished from mere bodily displacements, such as fleeing away from the haunts of men and living a secluded life in a forest. No place is safe and impregnable to the invasion of temptations which could molest the mind, as seen from the examples of Ādi-Bharata (Jaḍa-Bharata) and Śaubhari.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro13&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first decad of this centum, the Āḻvār spoke of the Super-eminent glory of the Lord and, in the very next decad, he exhorted the worldlings to turn their minds God-ward and get absorbed in Him, with whole-hearted devotion. But then, they felt that they were no better than the man, lame of both hands, being required to mount an elephant. Now, in this decad, the Āḻvār puts them at ease by depicting the disarming simplicity of the Lord, like unto an elephant making itself so pliable as to enable even such a lame man to mount it easily. Speaking about the Supreme Lord’s easy accessibility (saulabhya), the Aḻvār at once conjures up the vision of His being tied down to a mere pounder, when He, as Kṛṣṇa, the cowherd boy, got caught in the act of stealing butter—the very antithesis of His transcendent glory as the consort of Śrī Mahā Lakṣmī, residing on His winsome chest. Oh, what a contrast and what an amazing simplicity, which literally struck the poet dumb, nay, sent him into a deep trance, lasting six months! Here is an episode of episodes, melting down the hearts of the true devotees into running rivulets. As Śrī Vedānta Dēśika says, in his rapturous composition ‘Yādavābhyudaya mere contemplation of this episode leads to our release from bondage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro14&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sublime and the Sensual have always co-existed in both the worlds-the mundane and the spiritual. There is, however, a fundamental difference in their inter-relationship, in the respective spheres. In the material world, the two are mutually exclusive, being diametrically opposed to each other. In the spiritual world, that which, in the language of aesthetics, is termed as ‘&lt;em&gt;Śṛṅgār&lt;/em&gt;’, is nothing but the psychological imperative for man’s consciousness moving towards Him (Super-Soul) of ravishing beauty (as &lt;em&gt;Bhāgavatā&lt;/em&gt; bears out), just the very inversion of the skin-deep, carnal variety of lust, stamping out the human lover-beloved union. If the love-smitten Parāṅkuśa (Nammāḻvār, who was like unto a goad wearing round his spiritual antagonists through his scintillating hymns and making the Lord Himself pliable, enraptured by his sweet, love-laden hymns) turns out to be a female, expressing herself now as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (God-lover), then as the Mother, the intuitive gnostic friend of the love-lorn daughter trying to keep the latter under sobering restraint and sometimes as the soothing Mate, it is but the natural corollary to his boundless love for God and the deep yearning, beyond words, for the Divine presence and lasting union. Actually, the Lord is the only Male or Husband (&lt;em&gt;Loka bhartā&lt;/em&gt;), the ‘&lt;em&gt;Puruṣottama&lt;/em&gt;’ the &lt;em&gt;Kṣetrajña&lt;/em&gt;’ and all the Individual souls arc but marks of the feminine, the &lt;em&gt;Kṣetras&lt;/em&gt;’ (Location),, the female centres of the creative activity of God. It is indeed quite some consolation that the lover-beloved theme is familiar ground for the worldlings and now, without adopting the austere Vedic approach, the Āḻvār would only want them to shift the base and turn the whole drama God-ward and be wholly absorbed in ‘&lt;em&gt;Daiva Rasa&lt;/em&gt;’ (spiritual love), the ‘&lt;em&gt;Brahmānubhava&lt;/em&gt;’. Even as the female anatomy plays a key role in the earthly variety of love, in the spiritual world, ‘&lt;em&gt;Para Bhakti&lt;/em&gt;’, ‘&lt;em&gt;Para Jñāna&lt;/em&gt;’ and ‘&lt;em&gt;Parama Bhakti&lt;/em&gt;’, in the ascending scale of God-love, too deep for words, symbolise the breast of the God-lover, swelling up with God-love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro15&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In each of the preceding four decads, the Āḻvār has highlighted a particular trait of the Lord. These are exaltation (transcendent glory), Worship-worthiness, easy-accessibility (saulabhya) and forgiveness, respectively. In this decad, the Saint brings into focus the Lord’s condescension (sauśīlya), mixing freely with the lowliest, the crowning trait of the Lord, heading the list of sixteen traits mentioned by Śrī Vālmīki, in his poser at the very beginning of Rāmāyaṇa&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Śrī Rāma’s rapport with Guhā, the hunter, and intimate association with the monkeys, Vibhīṣaṇa etc., illustrate this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro16&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the pattern, hitherto noticed, of bringing to the fore a particular auspicious trait of the Lord in each decad (Tiruvāymoḻi), ‘Swārādatva’ (i.e.) easy worshippability of the Lord is emphasised in this decad. Unlike the minor deities whom it is very hard to propitiate, what with the sacrifice of goats and hens and other such harsh demands on their votaries, the Lord is pleased with whatever is offered to Him lovingly, with pious will. Being above wants of any kind, it is unthinkable that He would want from us any offering at all. God sets greater value upon the devotion of the heart than the material value of outward offerings. He hates hypocrisy and estimates the sincerity of the soul. In His song Celestial, He has affirmed: ‘Whoever offers Me in faith and love, a leaf (as Draupati [Draupadi] did), a flower (as Gajendra did), a fruit (as Sabhari did), water poured forth (as Ambariṣā did), that offering I accept, lovingly made with pious will. Things, easy of procurement for all, including the poorest of the poor, offered, not for expiation of sins or securing other ends but considering giving to Me as an end in itself and out of sheer inability to exist without making a lovegift to Me are indeed acceptable. In the absence of the devotee’s inability to offer anything for eating, I consume even the leaves and flowers offered. Vidura gave me plantain skins and Kuchela gave me but poor beaten rice and yet, I devoured them all with great avidity, like a famished fellow”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro17&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Easy worshippability apart, the Lord should also be adorable.. We see around quite a few persons whom it is easy to please but we don’t like to court as there is nothing attractive or prepossessing in them. This decad shows that the Lord is highly adorable because of His extraordinary sweetness. As Nampiḷḷai would have it, the Lord is adorable to such an extent that He grows envious of His devotees and wants to adore them, in turn, having Himself tasted the sweetness of adoration. In śloka ‘manujatva tiroitena&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;’ of Pādukā Sahaśram, Śrī Vedānta Deśika observes that, unlike the previous Avatāras when the Lord came all alone, He assumed four forms when He came down as Śrī Rāma and the three younger brothers. The purpose behind this was to adore His own pair of sandals which have a high reputation of their own. This He did in His other form as Bharata. Had Rāma come alone, He couldn’t have achieved this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro18&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this decad, the Āḻvār brings to the fore the Lord’s quality of ‘Uprightness’ (&lt;em&gt;ārjava&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;rujuḥ&lt;/em&gt;), His transparence in word, deed and thought, free from sophistry, duplicity, mental reservation, mischievous distortion etc. The Lord would not mean one thing, say another and do a third thing. When Sūrpaṇakhā saw Śrī Rāma at Pañcavaṭi and interrogated Him about His personal history, there would have been nothing wrong if He had tactfully withheld the truth from the demoness. But it was not in His grain to do so and hence He gave out the actual fact with remarkable sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro19&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Lord’s flow of grace unto the hitherto starved Soul were to be full and flooding, all of a sudden, the Subject cannot stand it and will just get swept off his feet. It is a matter of common knowledge how babes are fed through a graded course, beginning with breast milk, a little gruel some time later, and then, small bits of rice and so on. If, out of misplaced love, a parent fed the young one straightaway on adult scale-rice, curry and all that—the result would be disastrous. As in the case of food, in the matter of imparting education also, one goes step by step. Little wonder then, the omniscient Lord regulates the influx of His grace in such a manner that the recipient is able to stomach it all right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro110&#34;&gt;00 Intro1.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this decad, the Lord‘s voluntary or spontaneous grace is prominently brought out and extolled by the Āḻvār. Some Ācāryas, however, hold that the Āḻvār gives vent to his boundless joy resulting from the Lord‘s contact with him, limb by limb, mentioned in the preceding decad. The remarkable approach of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, that intellectual giant of extraordinary divine fervour to this decad is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the preceding decad, the Supreme Lord was shown to have finally got on to the Āḻvār’s head. Could there be any mystic experience more exalted than this? It was now up to the Lord to keep it up without once again snatching Himself away from the Āḻvār. That apart, the highest bliss, thus conferred by the Lord on the Āḻvār, led him on, to an introspection as to how he came by it. A thread-bare analysis of his own attainments reveals that he has none whatsoever and, at best, it could be said that he was God-bent and free from hatred for Him. Can it be said that a lemon fruit has secured a Kingdom, simply because a subject reverently placed a lemon fruit at the feet of a munificent King and got a liberal gift of territory, at the King’s pleasure? It is absolutely impossible, rather, it would be preposterous to correlate the slender means of the Individual, as good as non-existent, with the ‘End’, of mighty dimensions, as in the example cited above. Verily, the Lord is the root-cause even for the little merit, if any, acquired by the Individual, down the ages, as the latter was dowered with body and limbs, and put on a career of useful activity, only by Him. And so, the present ecstatic experience of the Āḻvār is traceable only to the Lord’s redemptive grace and, little wonder, the Āḻvār thaws down in grateful acknowledgement of the Lord’s benefaction, totally unrelated to the merit in him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
