      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro61&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw in the preceding centum from V-7 and onwards the Āḻvār seeking refuge in successive Pilgrim centres, at the feet of the Lord enshrined there. If the surrender at the feet of the Lord which should yield the result as a matter of course, did not meet with immediate response from the Lord, it was because He willed that the contemporary world as well as posterity should benefit through the Āḻvār’s scintillating hymns flowing from his sweet lips. It is indeed our great good fortune that the Āḻvār was not immediately lifted up to Heaven. In V-10, the Alvar prayed intensely for the acceleration of his union with the Lord and now he seeks out the Lord at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, a pilgrim centre in Keralā, but is too feeble to reach that place. The next best he could do in such a forlorn state, was to acquaint the Lord with his critical condition through some one. The Āḻvār, once again, gets tran-formed as a Nāyakī and sends some birds and bees to convey her message to the Lord. The birds, with their pair of wings, typify the devout, endowed with &lt;em&gt;great knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;good conduct&lt;/em&gt;, the efficient Preceptors, with a happy blending of these two essential requisites, for serving as an effective medium between Man and God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro62&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this decad, the Āḻvār strikes an entirely new note, making a bold departure, rather, in refreshing contrast to the earlier ones. The Saint, who was hitherto pining for the Lord’s presence and crying out his heart, now keeps Him at bay, when He eventually turns up in post-haste (even as He rushed to Gajendra’s aid) in response to the Nāyakī’s piteous appeal in the last decad, conveyed to the Lord through her special emissaries. The Nāyakī resents the Lord’s delayed appearance and arraigns Him for having strayed elsewhere, making love to the damsels of His special preference and He is being asked to go back to them. The door is shut against Him, a movement in the contrary direction indeed! But there is nothing uncommon about this, as this is a natural ingredient of convivial love, which is super-sensitive to, and extremely intolerant of the lapses on the part of either partner, the overzealous female, in particular, being critical of the remotest risk of alienation of the male from her, by his getting under the spell of any other lady-the characteristic feminine jealousy, keen and cruel. Actually, the Nāyakī’s pangs of separation even egged her on to the extreme step of putting an end to her life, rather than eking out a miserable existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 Nalkuravum, Celvum</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro63&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In VI-1, the Saint sent messages to Lord Rāma at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr but He responded, rather late. This made the Nāyakī furious and she enacted, in the preceding decad, all that tussle, which ensued between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs. Ultimately, the Lord proved victorious, as seen in VI-2-10, and the reunion between Him and the Saint materialised. The Saint now keeps musing over the superior might of the Lord, in having weaned him round, despite his stout resolve not to have anything to do with that malingering defaulter any more. The Lord reveals to the Āḻvār His extraordinary capacity for achieving the impossible besides the glorious Iconic Form in which He stays in Tiruviṇṇakar (In Tamil-nadu, near Tirukkuṭantai, covered by V-8). The Āḻvār recounts this experience, in the current decad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro64&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad of the last centum, the Āḻvār wished to sustain himself by contemplating the Lord’s wondrous deeds during His Avatāras but literally broke down, overwhelmed by emotion. It was with deep sorrow, born of frustration, he then gave vent to his inability to steady himself and recount the Lord’s deeds, mighty and miraculous. But the picture which has now emerged, is vastly different, the erstwhile emotional break-down and exhaustion yielding place to exhilaration. In every song, the first two lines, (as in the original text), recount the Lord&amp;rsquo;s glorious deeds and activities while the next two lines bespeak the Āḻvār’s extraordinary joy, resulting from such recital &lt;em&gt;cum&lt;/em&gt; contemplation. In dire contrast to the appalling sense of worthlessness, betrayed by him quite often in the earlier songs, the Āḻvār now concludes each song by showering on himself praises like, “there is none equal to me in all the land”, “there is none above me” etc. These do not. however, smack of bravado or hauteur, being the expressions of an ecstatic mind dissolved in God-love, by-no-means comparable to the utterances of those who are in their normal senses, dominated by egoistic compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>05 Tuval il ma mani matam</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro65&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme of Nāyakī, Mother and Mate, that is, the Āḻvār expressing himself in the vein of a female lover, her mother and mate, by turns, has already been dealt with, &lt;em&gt;in extenso&lt;/em&gt;, in the preamble to 1-4. Of the hundred decads, comprised in this work, as many as seventeen reflect the ‘Nāyakī’ aspect, seven are put in the mouth of the Mother and three voiced forth, by the mates. Taking this Sixth Centum alone, VI-1, VI-2 and VI-8 are the utterances of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, this one, the song of the mate while VI-6 and VI-7 are ascribed to the Mother. Thus, this centum reflects all the three types, like the fourth centum. As already elucidated, all these songs were, of course, the compositions of the Āḻvār, though ascribed to three different agencies, like unto the waters of the main river being conveyed through different channels. But then, let us now examine the necessity for the songs, in this decad, being put in the mouth of the mate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro66&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last decad was put in the mouth of the mates of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, while, in the current decad, it is her mother who speaks out the desperate condition of her love-lorn daughter. The manner in which the Nāyakī is dwindling down, losing, one by one, her feminine charms and embellishments, is set out, stanza by stanza. As a matter of fact, in IV-8 ante, these very things which now get dropped off, were despised by the Nāyakī, as not worth possessing, insofar as they had no bearing on Divine Service. As she meditates on the wondrous deeds, performed by the Lord, in each of His various Incarnations and the special traits then exhibited by Him, the Nāyakī goes into raptures and her body thaws down and dwindles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>07 Unnum Coru, Parukum nir</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro67&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mother continues her narration, in this decad also. She lay beside her love-lorn daughter, soothing her, as best as could be done. But suddenly, the mother groped the bed next to hers and discovered that her daughter was not in it. The former searched for the latter, high and low, but in vain. The mother was, however, well aware of her daughter’s exuberance of love for the Lord, enshrined at Tirukkōḷūr and, therefore, rightly concluded that the Nāyakī should have gone there. The Nāyakī’s extraordinary devotion to that pilgrim centre is now voiced forth by the mother. Actually, the Āḻvār’s longing for incessant communion with the Lord at Tirukkōḷūr finds expression, in this decad, the mother functioning as but the mouthpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro68&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.8&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is yet another decad, where the Āḻvār sends messages to the Lord through birds, bees etc, the two earlier ones being I-4 and VI-1. This is the third such decad and the fourth and the last decad of this kind is IX-7, The technique, in this regard, having been already elucidated in the preamble to I-4, it would suffice if the distinguishing feature of this decad is brought out, namely, the message is now sent to the Lord in His ‘Para’ or transcendent and ‘Antaryāmi’ or hidden Form, as Internal Controller of all, as could be gathered mainly from Stanzas 4 and 5 of this decad. It may be recalled that the messages in I-4 and VI-1 were conveyed to the Lord in His ‘Vyuha’ and ‘Vibhava’ aspects, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro69&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.9&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lord did not present Himself before the Āḻvār in spite of the errands run by his emissaries, as in the last decad. The Āḻvār, therefore, decided to raise his own clarion call of deep yearning, reaching the very Heavens, with robst faith in the fruition of his full-throated call for deliverance. It would indeed be well-nigh impossible for the Lord to stay in Heaven, once the Āḻvār’s voice is heard by Him, over there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;00-intro610&#34;&gt;00 Intro6.10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last decad, the Āḻvār voiced forth, in deep anguish, his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord, so as to be audible to Him, right in Heaven. And yet, there has been no response from the Lord and the Āḻvār is, therefore, in a state of extreme mental distress and physical debility. He is, however, quick to realise that the Lord stands enshrined in holy Tiruvēṅkaṭam (Andhra Pradesh), the common meeting ground of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Eternal Heroes in Heaven), the ‘Nitya Samsārīs’ (worldlings), birds and beasts. At this holy centre, the Āḻvār seeks refuge at the feet of the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother, inseparably poised on His winsome chest, voicing forth his sole dependence on Him. In the first nine songs of this decad, the Āḻvār dwells upon the glory and grandeur of the Lord, the Great Saviour, and, in the tenth, he surrenders at His feet, the Sole Refuge. No doubt, the Āḻvār had surrendered himself earlier also at the feet of the Lord, enshrined in other Pilgrim centres, c.f. IV-9, V-7 and V-8, but there is as much difference between those and the one currently resorted to, as between ‘Tirumantram’ and ‘Dvayam While the holy conjunction of Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother and the Lord is but implicit in the former, it is explicit in the latter, as in this decad, vide tenth song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
