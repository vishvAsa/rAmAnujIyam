## Data
### धनुर्-मासः, पूर्ण-चन्द्रः
Entire tiruppAvai is about 1 day.

> मार्गऴित्+++(=मार्गशीर्ष)+++ तिङ्गळ् मदि+++(→चन्द्र)+++ निऱैन्द+++(=नॆरिन्द)+++ नन्-नाळाल् ,

> मासोऽयं मार्गशीर्षो दिनम् अपि सुदिनं चन्द्र-सम्पूरितत्वात्
> 
> Today is the auspicious full moon day of Markazhi month:


### उषसि पक्षिणः

> 
> **दृष्ट्रवा** प्राच्यां प्रकाशं, तद्-अनु यदु-वरैर् **मुच्यमाना** महिष्यः,

nautical twilight (eastern sky brightens, Sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon, limited stars)  
between Astronomical twilight (Sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon), and civil twilight.

### Jupiter and venus

> वॆळ्ळिय्+++(=शुक्रः)+++ ऎऴुन्दु वियाऴम्+++(=गुरुः)+++ **उऱङ्गिट्रु**,  
पुळ्ळुं+++(=पक्षी)+++ शिलम्बिन+++(=कूजन्ति)+++ काण्! … ॥ १३ ॥ 
> 
> शुक्रः प्रादुरभूद् बृहस्पतिर् अगाद् अस्तं द्विजाश् चोत्थिताः  
> 
> The venus has risen in the morn,  
The Jupiter has vanished from the sky

So, venus should rise first, then guru should set (present tense), with birds chattering and eastern nautical twilight (per prior verses).

### Loss
viShNuchitta / periyALvAr describes his lost daughter (DP_२९९) - 

> ऒरु मगळ् तऩ्ऩै उडैयेऩ्, उलगम् निऱैन्द पुगऴाल्  
तिरुमगळ् पोल वळर्त्तेऩ्, सॆङ्-गण्-माल् ताऩ् कॊण्डु पोऩाऩ्,

> I have only one daughter  
and I raised her like Lakshmi, the beautiful goddess:  
The world praises me as a good mother:  
Lovely-eyed Thirumāl has taken her with him:

### king neDumAran
periyALHavar sings about neDumAran (DP_३४४) after andal married perumal, After tiruppAvai.

### pANDya chronology
See separate page: [TW](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v2/persons/pANDya/articles/ravilochana-dates)

### nAthamuni
rAmAnuja was born 1017. (1111 ce viShNuvardhana inscription in shrIrangam matches traditional 1098 melukoTe entry + 12 year exile.) 
When he was about 20, yAmuna was \~ 100. (Every guru parampara statement is very clear that he was extremely old.)  
So, yAmuna was born around 937.  
So, his grandfather nAthamuni must have preceeded 880.  
To make viShNuchitta and ANDAL contemporaneous with the compiler of their texts, nAthamuni, would be nonsensical.



## 672 पक्षः
ravilochana

### Astronomical fit
6th dec 672. approx Dhanus 13.
10th dec 672. Full moon.  
Venus rising at 3.09 and jupiter setting at around 5:13


672 it happened. 670s is the right time. Here, she mentions it after keezhvaanam vellendru. That matches with 670s.  


### neDumAran fit
And the claim that periyALvAr was contemporary of srivallabhan itself is baseless. Azhvar doesn't mention the name srivallabhan. Much later gpp text says vallabhadeva pandyan.

any mAravarman could be called neDumAran. And 671 is date of tiruppAvai. 

#### mAravarmA
Nedumaran living in 672 is shaky, but even if you accept it, it would still match Andal's date.

Even as per their own dates (which are wrong), ninra seer neDumAran was only ruling till 700 from 650. One may call him nayanmar. That doesn't change the fact that the ruler was indeed a neDumAran. Praise for a viShNu temple does not necessarily make neDumAran to be a "vaiShNava". shaiva kings gladly supported and even built viShNu temples - let alone sophisticated ones praising a sacred mountain shrine.




### Other candidates
886 is another probable year. But 886 is too late and it matches with nathamunis times. Periyazhvar was not a contemporary of Nathamuni. His video doesn't explain how there is a venus-jupiter combo in 861 CE.

Mu raghavaiyangar considered 731. But that happened much before sunrise. 731 occurrence is before twilight.


## 886
15 dec 886 matches very beautifully as per some (eg. nAgasvamI). Venus rising at 4.57 am, twilight at 5.12, civil twilight at 6.05, jupiter setting at 6.22 and sun rising at 6.28

#### Motivation
tiruvempAvai of mANikkavAchakar describes a shaiva lady undertaking a vrata so as to marry a good shaiva. shaiva fanatics want to twist evidence to imply that this novel vrata inspired tiruppAvai, rather than the other way around.

- gopis undergoing vrata for kRShNa is an old concept (recounted in the later bhAgavata), while the shaiva vrata is relatively much novel.
- mANikkavAchakar mentions a (shaiva) king (vara-guNa) who ruled in the 860s. However, confused (or contra-factual) shaivas push him back to early 800s. 


> And then they will claim that Andal lived in 861 or 886 (supposedly during Srimara Srivallabha's time). So Tiruvempavai came first and Tiruppavai was essentially a copy of Tiruvempavai.

## 861-पक्षः

The “Pullin Vaai Keendanai” pāsuram states that on the day it was sung, “Velli ezhunthu, Vezham urangitru”—meaning Venus was rising in the east while Jupiter was setting in the west.

Taking this astronomical reference into account and correlating it with the period during which Sri Andal lived, the date corresponds to December 12, 861 CE, based on my calculations.
