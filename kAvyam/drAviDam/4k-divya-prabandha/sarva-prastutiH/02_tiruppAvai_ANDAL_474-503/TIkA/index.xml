      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;0&#34;&gt;0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;तिरुप्पावै श्लोकाः अवतारिकासहिताः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SHRI ANDAL&amp;rsquo;s TIRUPPAVAI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit Slokas&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Author: S. N. Ramadesikan. (Siromani)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TIRUPPAVAI which consists of 30 songs is a small lyric, an expression of intense love for the Lord, by Shri Andal, one of the ten Vaishnavite saints of South India. Though it, has been translated into English, the need for a translation in Sanskrit, the language of the philosophy and religion of India, was felt very much, since such translation will make the non-Tamil knowing people understand the exquisite sweetness of the lyric and derive pleasure and profit by a daily chanting of it as the Tamil-knowing Shri Vaishnavas do. This versified translation of Tiruppavai first appeared in l942, in a monthly Journal called ``Desika Shri Sukti Samrakshani&amp;quot; published in Madras, together with an introduction in sixteen Sanskrit verses containing a short account of the origin of Tiruppavai and the life of Shri Andal.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The merit of this small work is borne out by the foreword and introductions by such eminent persons as Dr. B. Ramakrishna Rao-who is a poet himself both in Sanskrit and Telugu, who has translated Shri Jagannatha Pandita &amp;rsquo;s five laharis in Telugu poems, who is a Navabhasha Pandita and who has dived deep in the Visishtadvaita literature, Shri V. V. Giri-a born-leader, whose head and heart are noted for clarity and compassion, Shri M.Patanjali Sastriar-a great scholar in Sanskrit, the President of the Central Sanskrit Board, and retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, and Tarkarnava Pandita Ratna Shri Uttamur T. Viraraghavacharya whose profound scholarship in the Sastras has been recognised by the Central Government through the Presidential award in 1959, and under whom I studied the Nyaya Sastras.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I expresss my sincere thanks to all of them. I shall certainly deem my labour of love fully recompensed if the large circle of people for whose benefit this lyric has been prepared, read it and imbibe the spirit of Shri Andal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
