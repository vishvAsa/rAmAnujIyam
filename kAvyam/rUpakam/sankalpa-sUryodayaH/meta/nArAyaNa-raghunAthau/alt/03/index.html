every other goal of life is vile; their eyes, lovely with the moving pupils and excited by excessive passion, proclaim the truth of the Kāma&rsquo;-Sastra that the only true Brahman is Kama (Lust or carnal enjoyments).
Dvesha.-(With joy and impatience).
Friend! What a pity it is that even the erudite indulge in the unpalatable prattle that there be a bliss beyond the enjoyment of the celestial wenches.-enjoyment which is understood by some sages as Moksha itself,-the mark of the highest bliss, according to the votaries of thy creed who are thoroughly conversant with the relative differences of the diverse Ends of Life (purush-ārtha) and who always pursue (the End) Kama!</li>

Raga. -Friend! This is not the whole of it.</li>
<li>Some fiendish people would dupe the simple folk and make them believe that the pair of breasts, honey-full, of lovely looking damsels, surpassing the loveliness of golden globes, are but (lumps of) flesh.
(A voice in the air).
What saidst thou, Raya? What I said cannot be denied, for, only the blind behold not the purity of clear water!
Dvesha. Ala! Strange indeed is this attachment of the fiendish followers of Viveka towards Brahman! Perhaps it is but proper-for, to the deaf, the cuckoo&rsquo;s cooing can certainly create no emotion. But never mind these, Virēka himself shall be vanquished.
As evidenced by Krishna owning 60.000 wives

For:-</li>
<li>The victory over Viveka&rsquo;s adherents followeth as a matter of natural sequence from the victory over Viveka (himself), for, doth not the creeper wither of its accord when its prop-poplar is felled down ?
Raga-Well conceived!
Dvesha.(Laughing aloud).

<li>So long as I exist, surely this Vivéka whose wits are blinded by wallowing in the barren regions of the Upanishads, shall never attain the faultless. blessed, matchless, adorable supreme Brahman,-Brahman that hath in Him the gift of all Ends of Life&rsquo;.
(Behind the curtain).

<li>Mark! Virakti and Vishnu-Bhakti have escaped from the inextricable net1 but-spread by us and are retracing their steps towards Vivēka.
He who, facing us, cometh yonder, cheered by Virakti and Vishnu-Bhakti and led by the arm by Sumati is surely none but Viveka; in his presence whom victory favoureth, we unfortunates should not make a stand. For, if life exists, good things come. Our younger brothren Kāma and Krodha, capable of accomplishing our master&rsquo;s mission in a trice, also must tarry a while, for, in good time, all will he well. None is invincible to this Viveka, assisted (as he is) by Vyavasaya. Thus nay our royal mission land in jeopardy. 12. Fie, Fie, on Indra&rsquo;s heavenly

Svarga and Naraka, waking, dreaming, sleeping, swooning and agony of death.
Besides :-</li>
<li>Jiva doth wander in this Samsāra, made horrid by dotage, death, and fleeting sweet youth and by the manifold inter-related sins, flowing like the flood of the wild torrent, wherein the miraculously quick cosmic Creator seemeth to have distinguished the different Karmas by the force of his hurricaneLila3.
Viveka. (With remorse.) Queen!
What thou hast till now said is true. But listen to me now describing the long-accumulated Punya&rsquo; of the Jiva which maketh him long to trod in the Never-to-return Path.5</li>

</ol>
<p>Virtue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Archirādimarga-The path, leading to Moksha, led by the messengers of the Lord, and which finally shuts off rebirth.181</li>
<li>With his predisposition for a sojourn in Svarga, countered however by the frequent spectacle of the falls therefrom, the mind of Jiva doth engender in him an infinite thirst for the Para-Brahman&rsquo;. Even if this thirst at times becometh languid by mental weakness, it is again revived and it firmly establisheth in Jiva a penchant for either Bhakti or Prapatti&rsquo; according to his personal aptitude.
Further :-</li>
<li>Jiva, by sole decree of fortune, shall acquire an intense love for the ParaBrahman&rsquo;, engendered by the correct understanding of His Blessed Attributes, devoid of all defect, and shall know the natural difference in results, existing in the knowledge of the diverse Vidyas, the one as equally congenial as the other, like the different nectar-waves.
Then, the Jiva, like the bee, shall enjoy the honey of Parama-purusha&rsquo;s&rsquo; lotus-Feet</li>
<li>Supreme Lord.</li>
<li>Taking refuge on God.
182
and shall look upon even the Devacity ās but a hell.</li>
<li>Here, the moment Jiva casteth away his attachment to Samsara, on account of bis recollection of his endless wanderings, an eager longing to attain the Supreme Brahman doth seize him through the knowledge of His singular attributes, and he then doth rightly indulge in the study of the several groups of sciences, relating to Godhead, pure, and devoid of all delusions and by discerning as to which of the manifold attributes of God are specifically dealt with and which not in any particular science (thereof).
I shall just dwell in brief on the methods of overcoming this illusion.</li>
<li>Mōksia, reached through a knowledge of the different (God) Sciences&rsquo; is either one or many. If they are one, the *!!! existence of several sciences is not justified,</li>
<li>Nana-Vidyas the varied ways of divine medi-
tation which are 32 such as fal, etc.
183
as one of them alone may bring about Moksha. If they are many, there may be a durational difference etc., in their enjoyment, like the difference attributed by the Mimāmsakās to the enjoyment of Svarga, and the existence of several (God)&rsquo; sciences is then justified. This fallacious argument of the babblers who do not understand correctly the meanings of the Pramanas which re-iterate, that difference there is none, either in time or enjoyment in Moksha, but only among the (God)1 sciences which treat of this end,&ndash;fails, through its lack of sense.
In spite of this, those who err, will ever err. For, even if the
crows are
washed with thousands of water-pots, they shall never turn white. The virtuous, will with no hesitation understand the truth propounded by those who apprehend the truth of God and who abjure the whole conclave of agnostics, and will attain Sarvesvara.1</li>

Restored am I now, by thy language, disclosing a leaning for sound authorities. Umparallelled indeed is thy greatness in sifting the drift of Pramanas, by savants respect-worthy.
For :-</li>
<li>Now the Naga&rsquo; damsels, residing in mountain-caves on ocean-shore, sing aloud thy fame, which shineth like the moon, washed of her stain by the billows of the Gangā, on the crest of Siva, when he is disturbed by his dreadful Delugedance, and they get delighted at the perennial How of nectar, exuding from each letter of the alphabet, making up thy praise!

Viveka. -What sayest thou? The burden of
the care of Jiva is now indeed practically lightened. For, his Virāgya, springing from his desire to vision Brahman, conduceth in a greater measure to help towards (God) sciences, than that Virāgya which springeth from the knowledge of the ills of Samsāra.</li>

sciences, the Jiva performeth the Nitya&rsquo; and Naimittika&rsquo; duties for the sole pleasure of Para-Brahman, and delighted with the doing of these duties, he now hasteneth to fix his mind in Yoga, made blissful by currents of fresh nectar, flowing in the milky ocean of devotion, directed to the Divine Presence of the Para-Brahman-the Seat of all bliss.3</li>
<li>Further, when Jiva-abashed&ndash;museth in his mind about the unreal nature of sense-delights, resembling but a Gandharvacity, I stretch out to him my helping hand and he quickly tideth over the perplexities of mind and doth fix the same exclusively on the Para-Brahman, thus easily crossing the Samsāric-ocean, as if it did cover a cow foot-space&quot;.

Viveka. -Timid dame! Knowing, as thou art, the whole truth, how is it that thou dost indulge in doubts, like a witless woman?</li>
<li>A certain resolute person, who hath detached himself from Samsāra, renounceth all external sense-pleasures, as if it were honey-mixed poison, setteth his face against the finitely blissful Kaivalya,&rsquo; and even in this world evinceth fitfully an intense longing for the enjoyment of the infinite and eternally blissful Brahman.
It is but natural that a ripe fruit, which even an expert who hath climbed up the branch of a tree cannot pluck, falleth before a way-farer-a result of the strength of mere matured&rsquo; merit, expecting no effort on his part.</li>

Unaccountably then to assert that even the wise should indulge in fear till actual emancipation (is reached) is like trying to smell the fragrance of the lotus blossoming in the sky.</li>

Sumati.-Aryaputra! Proceed.</li>
<li>Renouncing the Lord&rsquo;s grace, which is as it were the cataclysmic-fire to the evergrowing infatuation of the mind and which swalloweth the oceans of sin, riding a bad horse of Karma, is as futile as the erection of a salt dam across the brackish ocean

Sumati. Rightly so. I shall just ask thee who hast so thoroughly grasped the truth of truths one thing more. Why is not the realisation of Moksha swiftly accomplished even by high-souled men with a thorough comprehension of the inmost truths of Upanishads, learnt at the hands of spotless Achāryas,-men who have uprooted opposite creeds, who have given up the tendency to indulge in Svargic sojourn, who have set their hearts on the great bliss of the worship of Madhusudana&rsquo;s blessed feet,</li>

exempt from the faintest trace of stain, who have betaken to Nivritti-dharma&rsquo; without the slightest inattention and who know no obstacles?
Viveka. Lady dear! I shall just unfold
to thee another subtle truth, fit to be treasured up by the wise in their hearts. Hear me with unalloyed attention what the great Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumāra, Nārada, Sāndilya and other Paramekāntins2 have often propounded.</li>
<li>The thousand-yojana&quot; whale doth consume a hundred-yojana whale; the bigger whale doth swallow even this thousand-yojana whale and the still bigger whale doth gulp down even the aforesaid whale ; such then is the course of Karma.

Sumati.-Musing) Lord! Such indeed is the unique heinousness of the sin of insulting the true realiser of Brahman, so ably elucidated by thee.
Is there then no remedy for this sin?
Viveka.-There is but one remedy and that is seeking the pardon of the one that was insulted.</li>

For:-</li>
<li>An aquatic animal&rsquo; falleth into great anguish by being out of water, but the same doth revive by water gradually gained. Similarly, the Jíva, cast away by the insult offered to the great, falleth into Samsara and getteth true knowledge back by resorting to the very person.

Viveka.-Queen! True. The ever-hostile obstacles to (God-) Yoga are indeed difficult to surmount. The attainment of Moksha will be unfettered only if these Yogaobstacles are prevented from appearing at all, instead of renouncing them after they actually occur.
