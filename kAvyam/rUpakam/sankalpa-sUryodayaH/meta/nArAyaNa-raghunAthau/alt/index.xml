      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEN ENTER SRADDHA&amp;rsquo; AND VICHARANA.&amp;quot;&#xA;Vicharana.With thy brow bedewed with beads of sweat, thou seemest as flurried as the cow to see her calf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lovely are thy globules of sweat, resembling nectar from thy face-moon dripping, or in the lustrous Malli-blossom&amp;quot; blown dewing, or from the noble creeper of youth budding.&#xA;Sraddha. -My beloved companion! With a wish to prosecute (to a good end) what hath been undertaken by her husband (Viveka), who is firmly planted in the one-pointed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zeal. 2. Investigation. 3. Jasmine flower.&#xA;87&#xA;verdict of the Upanishads, and who hath taken the resolve to combat the opponents (thereof), Sumati the faithful, the blessed wife of Viveka, hath, to symbolize the welfare (of the mission) sped to the hill of gems fringing the woodland of pramada,1 bidding me cull a cluster of lotuses golden, worthy to lay at the lotus-feet of Sri&amp;rsquo;s Spouse (Vishnu). She there sits, heart full of joy, and I shall speed to Gangā as smiling with her freshes as Sarasvati, the swan in the lotus-face of the Lotus-born2.&#xA;(Gesturing fatigue of journey).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When will the clear fair Mandakini,&amp;quot; with banks on either side of its stream, fragrant with the odours of jasmine that creep up the Kalpaka-trees flourishing amidst cool ponds between, (when will this Mandakini,) alas! wear away the sorrows which, by (souls) violently whirled in samsāric wheel,&amp;rsquo; are hard to bear?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A Pleasure Garden where ladies of the harem sport. The Demiurge, son of Vishnu. 3. The Ganges. i.e., rebirths without number.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;88&#xA;Vicharana.-(Pointing in front).&#xA;Here floweth in our vicinity the Ganga. Thou shalt rest for a while, to ward off the Sun&amp;rsquo;s heat,-as piercing as the poignant words of a villain,-in the jasmine bower grown on an islet in Ganga that issueth flowing from the feet of Madhu&amp;rsquo;s Conquerer (Vishnu) and rich with the odour of the honey of Kalpaka-blossoms, scattered by the gentle breeze as cool as the heart of the good, and then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But apart from the exuberance of fresh-blossoming juvenility, witness their amorous display!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their eyebrows, Cupid&amp;rsquo;s victorious penons, gesticulate that the true end of life is lust, their gait condemneth that&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also means qualities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The period when maiden-hood and youth&#xA;meet.&#xA;174&#xA;every other goal of life is vile; their eyes, lovely with the moving pupils and excited by excessive passion, proclaim the truth of the Kāma&amp;rsquo;-Sastra that the only true Brahman is Kama (Lust or carnal enjoyments).&#xA;Dvesha.-(With joy and impatience).&#xA;Friend! What a pity it is that even the erudite indulge in the unpalatable prattle that there be a bliss beyond the enjoyment of the celestial wenches.-enjoyment which is understood by some sages as Moksha itself,-the mark of the highest bliss, according to the votaries of thy creed who are thoroughly conversant with the relative differences of the diverse Ends of Life (purush-ārtha) and who always pursue (the End) Kama!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How shall the&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ef. कामस्तदसमवर्तताधि.&#xA;All-sustainer&amp;quot;&#xA;be&#xA;9 If God sustains and permeates everything, it follows that he permeates sin as well and it is hence a contradiction to say that he is free from all sins.&#xA;175&#xA;uncontaminated with sin, and how again the Lord, the All-Desirer be free from desire?&#xA;Raga. -Friend! This is not the whole of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some fiendish people would dupe the simple folk and make them believe that the pair of breasts, honey-full, of lovely looking damsels, surpassing the loveliness of golden globes, are but (lumps of) flesh.&#xA;(A voice in the air).&#xA;What saidst thou, Raya? What I said cannot be denied, for, only the blind behold not the purity of clear water!&#xA;Dvesha. Ala! Strange indeed is this attachment of the fiendish followers of Viveka towards Brahman! Perhaps it is but proper-for, to the deaf, the cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s cooing can certainly create no emotion. But never mind these, Virēka himself shall be vanquished.&#xA;As evidenced by Krishna owning 60.000 wives&#xA;176&#xA;For:-&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The victory over Viveka&amp;rsquo;s adherents followeth as a matter of natural sequence from the victory over Viveka (himself), for, doth not the creeper wither of its accord when its prop-poplar is felled down ?&#xA;Raga-Well conceived!&#xA;Dvesha.(Laughing aloud).&#xA;own&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So long as I exist, surely this Vivéka whose wits are blinded by wallowing in the barren regions of the Upanishads, shall never attain the faultless. blessed, matchless, adorable supreme Brahman,-Brahman that hath in Him the gift of all Ends of Life&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;(Behind the curtain).&#xA;Who is that? Who is that?&#xA;(Bath listen, with fear and confusion).&#xA;Alas! what mishap! What may befall us who are intent on executing our master&amp;rsquo;s command? Alas! Our luck would seem to&#xA;take a new turn now!&#xA;177&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mark! Virakti and Vishnu-Bhakti have escaped from the inextricable net1 but-spread by us and are retracing their steps towards Vivēka.&#xA;He who, facing us, cometh yonder, cheered by Virakti and Vishnu-Bhakti and led by the arm by Sumati is surely none but Viveka; in his presence whom victory favoureth, we unfortunates should not make a stand. For, if life exists, good things come. Our younger brothren Kāma and Krodha, capable of accomplishing our master&amp;rsquo;s mission in a trice, also must tarry a while, for, in good time, all will he well. None is invincible to this Viveka, assisted (as he is) by Vyavasaya. Thus nay our royal mission land in jeopardy. 12. Fie, Fie, on Indra&amp;rsquo;s heavenly&#xA;harlot&amp;rsquo;s rolling looks! Fie, Fie, on Cupid&amp;rsquo;s bow betwanging&#xA;the pompous twang in battles! Fie, Fie, on cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s penta-chorded&#xA;tunes!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aforesaid net of imputing sin to Moksha.&#xA;S. s. 12&#xA;178&#xA;Fie, Fie, on Royal Moha&amp;rsquo;s chivalrous&#xA;pomp-dancing on Kāma-Sastra&#xA;stage!&#xA;Why mention more of matters more&#xA;For, Now:-&#xA;inert?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEN ENTER KAMA AND VASANTA.&#xA;Kama.Friend Vasanta !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sugar-cane so tender for my bow,&#xA;yon flowers for my shafts,&#xA;Bee-swarm humming sweet harp&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;melody for my bow-string,&#xA;Fair sex, timid and weak, for my&#xA;battalion ; all these true.&#xA;With these aids tender, of my own&#xA;will, prosper I-the conquerer&#xA;of the Trident-wearer.1&#xA;Further :-&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With missiles and shafts, by thee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Siva.&#xA;granted,&#xA;208&#xA;And with thee for my help ever&#xA;See how Móha great wieldeth,&#xA;unfailing,&#xA;The universe under one umbrella.1&#xA;Vasanta.-What sayest thou? Thou art Kama&#xA;indeed!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Through prescribed and proscribed&#xA;Karmas with their senses performed, Longing for some results, the&#xA;savants awakened,&#xA;To thee of infinite marvel, impute they, Their deeds, saying &amp;ldquo;Kama did&#xA;them and Manyu&amp;rsquo; did them&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With Siva and others, thy sportive&#xA;battles thou didst have,&#xA;Thy free diversion-resorts are Deva-&#xA;chief&amp;rsquo;s mansions,&#xA;Thy pleasure-park is this sea-girt&#xA;earth,&#xA;Ah Madana! How to describe thee, the&#xA;splendour&amp;rsquo;s ocean?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The meaning is that the whole world is under&#xA;Mōha&amp;rsquo;s Lord paramountcy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anger. cf. msania agafa&#xA;209&#xA;Kama. - Friend! Just think of thy greatness&#xA;known all the world over.&#xA;For :-&#xA;the whole&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Well-known it is that the origin of Sumanas1 is thyself universe delighteth in thee; thou art indeed the foremost of the thrice-two seasons: Jótis2 entirely doth depend on thee: Madhava where Sri&amp;rsquo; doth dwell, bearing Pankaja, is all thy own and Kama is thy minister. What other better season is there that can match with thee?&#xA;Besides :-&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thou art the Fire named Vasanta ; this Malaya zephyr is thy charioteer: Asóka&#xA;Two meanings in 4 to 7:-&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Devas-Flowers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sacrifice (afia), and ParaBrahman.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vishnu, month of Vaisakha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5&#xA;Lakshmi living in the Lotus Tank&amp;ndash;Loveliness&#xA;of Lotus Tank.&amp;quot;&#xA;Malaya mountain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEN ENTER DAMBHA AND KUHANA.&#xA;Dambha.-Halloo! Kuhanā! my dutiful wife ! I want thee. For, thou art my co-partner, by none unpolluted, as was Tārā&amp;rsquo; owned by Brihaspati, and Ahalya owned by Gautama. Thou wouldst not brook even a moment&amp;rsquo;s separation from me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tara, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by&#xA;Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship.&#xA;The&#xA;Drama of Tārā Sasanka is too well known to be&#xA;reproduced here in extenso.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ahalya, the wife of Gautama was seduced by Indra. The latter, enraged at this seduction, cursed his wife and transformed her to a stone. She continued in this stony state till Sri Rama gave her back her former form by the touch of his feet, on his way to Mithila.&#xA;249&#xA;Kuhana.-Thou, the best of Brahmanas, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: &amp;ldquo;As Arundhati&amp;rsquo; owned by Vasishta.&amp;rdquo; Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself!&#xA;Dambha.-(Smiling). Therefore thou art the best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra&amp;rsquo; and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gārhapatya fire is extinguished.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arundhati, the wife of Vasishta, is reputed to be one of the unquestionably chaste ladies ever known.&#xA;A ceremony performed daily, both morn and eve, wherein the housewife has to look to the unbroken continuance of Fire, all through her life&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the three kinds of sacred fires pertaining&#xA;to married life.&#xA;250&#xA;My Sthālipāka&amp;rsquo; ceremony is similarly never interrupted, as thou concealest even thy menstrual course. Similarly again the Vaisvadeva and Pitriyajnya ceremonies are never interrupted. Where then is the occasion for expiation ?&#xA;Kuhana.-Hush!&#xA;Heaven forbid !! There is need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas.&#xA;Dambha.-Well, Kuhanā! Indeed, thou art&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A ceremony done with grain as the chief ingredient before the fire and completed on the full-moon day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A ceremony done with oblations to fire after&#xA;the daily midday worship.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ceremonies relating to departed souls.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Full-moon days when Sthālipaka is performed.251&#xA;Much I esteem&#xA;my co-partner in life. thee, as thou dost maintain my Brahmanism, thou-my sacrificial wife-the lawfully wedded wife of a great Srōtriya&amp;rsquo;. Always thou observest the Dvādasi2 vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivasaras days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret.&#xA;There now exist some Asuras, who have hid goodbye to all Dharmas, putting on the garb of ascetics, maintaining arguments tending to Māyā, seeming, as they&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One well-versed in the Vēdas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 12th day of the Lunar and the Solar fortnights when Brahmanas take sumptuous meals early in the morning after a fast on the previous day. That time of Dvadasi during which fast is&#xA;prescribed.&#xA;அகத்திக்கீரை, சண்டக்காய், நெல்லிமுள்ளி ete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
