Tara, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship. The Drama of Tārā Sasanka is too well known to be reproduced here in extenso. Ahalya, the wife of Gautama was seduced by Indra. The latter, enraged at this seduction, cursed his wife and transformed her to a stone. She continued in this stony state till Sri Rama gave her back her former form by the touch of his feet, on his way to Mithila. 249 Kuhana.-Thou, the best of Brahmanas, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: “As Arundhati’ owned by Vasishta.” Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself! Dambha.-(Smiling). Therefore thou art the best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra’ and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gārhapatya fire is extinguished. Arundhati, the wife of Vasishta, is reputed to be one of the unquestionably chaste ladies ever known. A ceremony performed daily, both morn and eve, wherein the housewife has to look to the unbroken continuance of Fire, all through her life One of the three kinds of sacred fires pertaining to married life. 250 My Sthālipāka’ ceremony is similarly never interrupted, as thou concealest even thy menstrual course. Similarly again the Vaisvadeva and Pitriyajnya ceremonies are never interrupted. Where then is the occasion for expiation ? Kuhana.-Hush! Heaven forbid !! There is need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas. Dambha.-Well, Kuhanā! Indeed, thou art A ceremony done with grain as the chief ingredient before the fire and completed on the full-moon day. A ceremony done with oblations to fire after the daily midday worship. Ceremonies relating to departed souls. Full-moon days when Sthālipaka is performed.251 Much I esteem my co-partner in life. thee, as thou dost maintain my Brahmanism, thou-my sacrificial wife-the lawfully wedded wife of a great Srōtriya’. Always thou observest the Dvādasi2 vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivasaras days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret. There now exist some Asuras, who have hid goodbye to all Dharmas, putting on the garb of ascetics, maintaining arguments tending to Māyā, seeming, as they One well-versed in the Vēdas. The 12th day of the Lunar and the Solar fortnights when Brahmanas take sumptuous meals early in the morning after a fast on the previous day.

  <p>THEN ENTER DAMBHA AND KUHANA.
Dambha.-Halloo! Kuhanā! my dutiful wife ! I want thee. For, thou art my co-partner, by none unpolluted, as was Tārā&rsquo; owned by Brihaspati, and Ahalya owned by Gautama. Thou wouldst not brook even a moment&rsquo;s separation from me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tara, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by
Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship.
The
Drama of Tārā Sasanka is too well known to be
reproduced here in extenso.</li>
<li>Ahalya, the wife of Gautama was seduced by Indra. The latter, enraged at this seduction, cursed his wife and transformed her to a stone. She continued in this stony state till Sri Rama gave her back her former form by the touch of his feet, on his way to Mithila.
249
Kuhana.-Thou, the best of Brahmanas, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: &ldquo;As Arundhati&rsquo; owned by Vasishta.&rdquo; Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself!
Dambha.-(Smiling). Therefore thou art the best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra&rsquo; and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gārhapatya fire is extinguished.</li>
<li>Arundhati, the wife of Vasishta, is reputed to be one of the unquestionably chaste ladies ever known.
A ceremony performed daily, both morn and eve, wherein the housewife has to look to the unbroken continuance of Fire, all through her life</li>
<li>One of the three kinds of sacred fires pertaining
to married life.
250
My Sthālipāka&rsquo; ceremony is similarly never interrupted, as thou concealest even thy menstrual course. Similarly again the Vaisvadeva and Pitriyajnya ceremonies are never interrupted. Where then is the occasion for expiation ?
Kuhana.-Hush!
Heaven forbid !! There is need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas.
Dambha.-Well, Kuhanā! Indeed, thou art</li>
<li>A ceremony done with grain as the chief ingredient before the fire and completed on the full-moon day.</li>
<li>A ceremony done with oblations to fire after
the daily midday worship.</li>
<li>Ceremonies relating to departed souls.</li>
<li>Full-moon days when Sthālipaka is performed.251
Much I esteem
my co-partner in life. thee, as thou dost maintain my Brahmanism, thou-my sacrificial wife-the lawfully wedded wife of a great Srōtriya&rsquo;. Always thou observest the Dvādasi2 vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivasaras days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret.
There now exist some Asuras, who have hid goodbye to all Dharmas, putting on the garb of ascetics, maintaining arguments tending to Māyā, seeming, as they</li>
<li>One well-versed in the Vēdas.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The 12th day of the Lunar and the Solar fortnights when Brahmanas take sumptuous meals early in the morning after a fast on the previous day. That time of Dvadasi during which fast is
prescribed.
அகத்திக்கீரை, சண்டக்காய், நெல்லிமுள்ளி ete.</p>

Could ye possibly be even the shadow of our likeness, having forms, self-luminious and splendrously bright as the Sun ? &ldquo;Drop into perdition&rdquo; is all that you deserve. Alas! This, thy husband, a disgrace to his order, surely betrayeth his ignorance under the pretext of silence, by disregarding me, the greatest of the great, and esteemworthy for all the universe and this guest of an ascetic woman who have resorted to thee, to clear the doubt: who should prostrate whom &ldquo;.

Could even myriad reflected images of the Sun form themselves into a real Sun ?
Durmati. -Aryaputra! Before this paramount faith propounded by Brihaspati, what is Mukti, what is enjoyment and what is God?
Mahamoha. Just hearken.</p>
<ol>
<li>The dissolution of body is Mukti; superb sexual pleasure is enjoyment; and damsels giving this pleasure and adorned with youth are the gods.
And so it is, my queen, who knoweth the truth of truths! These, thy questions, have been replied to in consonance with Experience.
The grace of these visible gods is the one thing to be sought after, for conquering our foe in the person of Viveka.301
Durmeti.-May thou receive the grace of these damsels-living gods, and fit to be conversel with. But how is it possible to conquer Vivēka, through their grace? Mahamoha. Thus surely</li>
<li>The Yoga of even the men, intent on deep penance,-men who have mastered all the Vedas and who have restrained the senses outer and inner, the picture in the shape of slender-waisted damsels, painted on the walls-Imagination, even without the aid of the artist&rsquo;s brush, shall undo.
The Vedantins state that even those dear to the Supreme Lord on account of their aversion to sense-enjoyments refrain not from pleasures but indulge in diverse pleasures, eating, drinking, sporting with women, riding on carriages, etc, and this is the great virtue (of our faith). Indeed none would fly from the fear of the scorpion to the mouth of the dragon.
