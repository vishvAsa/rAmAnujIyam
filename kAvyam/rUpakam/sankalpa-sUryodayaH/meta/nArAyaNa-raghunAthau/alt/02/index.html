  <p>THEN ENTER SRADDHA&rsquo; AND VICHARANA.&quot;
Vicharana.With thy brow bedewed with beads of sweat, thou seemest as flurried as the cow to see her calf.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lovely are thy globules of sweat, resembling nectar from thy face-moon dripping, or in the lustrous Malli-blossom&quot; blown dewing, or from the noble creeper of youth budding.
Sraddha. -My beloved companion! With a wish to prosecute (to a good end) what hath been undertaken by her husband (Viveka), who is firmly planted in the one-pointed</li>
<li>Zeal. 2. Investigation. 3. Jasmine flower.
87
verdict of the Upanishads, and who hath taken the resolve to combat the opponents (thereof), Sumati the faithful, the blessed wife of Viveka, hath, to symbolize the welfare (of the mission) sped to the hill of gems fringing the woodland of pramada,1 bidding me cull a cluster of lotuses golden, worthy to lay at the lotus-feet of Sri&rsquo;s Spouse (Vishnu). She there sits, heart full of joy, and I shall speed to Gangā as smiling with her freshes as Sarasvati, the swan in the lotus-face of the Lotus-born2.
(Gesturing fatigue of journey).</li>
<li>When will the clear fair Mandakini,&quot; with banks on either side of its stream, fragrant with the odours of jasmine that creep up the Kalpaka-trees flourishing amidst cool ponds between, (when will this Mandakini,) alas! wear away the sorrows which, by (souls) violently whirled in samsāric wheel,&rsquo; are hard to bear?</li>
<li>A Pleasure Garden where ladies of the harem sport. The Demiurge, son of Vishnu. 3. The Ganges. i.e., rebirths without number.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>88
Vicharana.-(Pointing in front).
Here floweth in our vicinity the Ganga. Thou shalt rest for a while, to ward off the Sun&rsquo;s heat,-as piercing as the poignant words of a villain,-in the jasmine bower grown on an islet in Ganga that issueth flowing from the feet of Madhu&rsquo;s Conquerer (Vishnu) and rich with the odour of the honey of Kalpaka-blossoms, scattered by the gentle breeze as cool as the heart of the good, and then proceed.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the self-same place-
The wind-tossed trees shower from their branch-tops flowers prodigally redolent,-flowers fit to deck the fillets circling the locks of the ladies of Mahēndra&rsquo;s court, reposing in the shade,-flowers reminding the shafts of the great archer Kāma, the betrayer of the coyness of women. Sraddha.-Be it as it pleaseth thee, my friend!
(Both sit down with ease.)
Sraddha.Lo! Vicharanā! What brought thee
to this place ?
89
Vicharana. My beloved friend! Hear me.
Some apostates and agnostics, clever in establishing the doctrine of Buddha and Jina, have now been ordered by king Mahāmōha-irate at hearing the preparations of king Vivēka, assisted by his chief Vyavasaya,&rsquo;-to perturb Jiva whose mind is now firmly fixed on Purushottama&rsquo;s (Vishnu&rsquo;s) lotus-feet, by diverting it to some other object, just like a tiller leaving his plough and running after a jackal&rsquo;. The rumour that these atheists surround the Jiva hath reached Sumati, our queen, who hath asked me to convey this news confidentially to the chief Vyavasaya, who is now closetted with the great king Vivēka. I have now set out to see this Vyavasaya.
Sraddha. That the Perverts have joined hands with Mahāmōha in his enterprise is just like the asses&rsquo; song in the ghost&rsquo;s marriage. But mind not. It is no difficult task at all</li>
<li>Industry or Effort. 2. हालिकजम्बुकदर्शनन्याय
90
for our great king to overthrow the doctrines of our opponents.
Vicharana.-Hallo! Sraddhā! How thinkest thou that the doctrines of several able apostates, pursuing the creed of Brihaspati1 and others, could be subverted by a single person?
Sraddha. Thou shalt realise the truth of what I say, on the basis of the popular dictum that truth alone endureth and untruth betrayeth itself in time.</li>
<li>Quick can Vivēka overthrow the creeds of all Heretics like the rising Sun driving darkness dense, like the raging wild fire devouring the forest dry,-the forest of the Vindhya range,-like the mighty hurricane blowing off cotton mountains high.</li>
<li>The School of Philosophy founded by Brihaspati the main doctrine of which is :&ndash;&quot; Enjoy whilst thou livest, for it is but blank after death.&quot;
Eat and live to-day, let to-morrow take care of itself.&quot; &amp;c. See Paramata-bhanga by Desika.91
Therefore the attempt of Mahāmōha in collecting a host of Perverts to conquer Vivēka is no better than that
of a stone-raft sought out for crossing the high seas.
Vicharana.-Dear friend! Thy words have swift imparted courage to me, and my mis-givings have given way. I shall see my lady after speedily executing her commands.
Sraddha.-Hallo! Vichārana! Thy level-headedness, and friendship as well, have been demonstrated. I will now gather lotus blossoms, and thou wilt betake to the royal castle.
Interlude ends.
(Both exeunt.)
THEN ENTER KING AND VYAVASAYA.
King.-General mine! This
indeed is the
best time for me to take stock of work done and of work remaining as regards Jiva journeying to the goal of Bliss,-Jiva
92
distracted by pursuits vain and bound by karmas severe, so many times over.
(Brooding for a while and sighing.) 5. In this perfect world, teeming mostly with ignoramuses, God&rsquo;s displeasure compelleth crafty men being born, to range themselves in hostile camps, to devise doctrines diverse, and by their inculcation to provoke wranglings many. In no way do these differ from the ravings of men gone daft.
Alas! How shall true Vēdānta thrive in this world pestered by (such) doctrines distractingly diverse, causing confusion worse confounded?
(Looking at the sky.)
Ah, thou vile Mahāmōha! By rendering the worlds three bewildered what hath been or what will be thy gain?</li>
<li>Where drugs life-giving have become scarce, noxious ones beteem the sea-girt earth.
To remove this pain, I shall resort to the Lord Almighty.
93
(Gesturing recollection.)</li>
<li>I adore the causeless and stainless splendour of Hayagriva, present as a pure mount crystal-made, depriving the agonies of the worlds three by His dazzle, nectarlike,-Hayagriva whose neighing voice resembleth the Upanishads Eternal.</li>
<li>Further, may the neigh of Hayagrivathe sum and sense and seat of Vedas, Sāma, Rig and Yajur,-of all obstacles the Remover, the surging swell of the sea of selfknowledge-efface my inner ignorance, caused by the clamour of heretics, conceited, combative and carrying a roaring trade (of theirs.)
Senapati.-Ah. Great King! By valour over Mahāmōha, thy success is as sure as the unfailing noise of the Aranyakas that compare only with Anaranya&rsquo;s curse.</li>
<li>The horse-faced form of Vishnu.</li>
<li>The main body of the Upanishads.</li>
<li>A king of the Ikshvāku race, an ancestor of Sri Rama, was forced to wage a battle with Bavana when the former was quite unprepared and
94</li>
<li>Thou hast just imparted Vedantaknowledge to Jiva; all that remaineth now to be done is to remove his inattention2.

Guru.-When a pupil, good and lowly, doth approach, what is there that cannot in its good time be imparted to him?
Pupil.-Divine sire! Victory by logomachic methods is by great sages forbidden. For, they say that he who gloateth over such a victory over a Brahmana shall be born a cursed&rsquo; tree in the burning ground. How else are our disputants of the opposite side to be vanquished?

Guru.-Charming child! When there is a difference of opinion among our own adherents, thou shalt stand by a Sāstra common to them, but when the difference is with rival thinkers, by the Vēdānta Siddhānta; even here, there are five or six high-class works dignified by brevity and glossary composed by us under the inspiration of Achāryas-Parāsara, Vyāsa, Suka, Saunaka, Bodhāyana and others. Wellversed in these works, and heart set on them, thou shalt employ authorities and arguments that will carry convincing joy to the assembly.
Pupil. &ndash;So long as thou art vouchsafing to me,
I shall not in the least err.</li>
<li>In a mind elevated in character by the grace of the Guru, what (truth) instinctively flasheth can vanish never. But when wrong interpretations are fabricated even by Rishis or others, they shall in no time pass into limbo.

Guru.-Lad! Dreading the world-deluding sophistries (extant), I commend thee to close attention.</li>
<li>The fallacies established by ill-witted apostates and perverts, causing a momentary confusion even to (the intellect of) a council of adepts in (Vēdāntic) debate,-only connoting nonsense, genetic of false developments-and as stony as the heart of women, excite much fear.
Pupil.-Divine sire! This dread concerning me can only arise from thy inordinate affection for me.</li>
<li>Breatheth there a man, desirous of wordy-war who dare challenge me to contest, whilst at thy hands I have received all knowledge, and whilst under thy commands, I am acting?

systems shattered indeed by Yatindra,-those blinded by the night of inner illusion ?
Besides :-</p>
<ol>
<li>Whoso, in this last age (Kali), learneth this Yati-king&rsquo;s dialectic dissertations, disclosing the
the peculiar
peculiar Visishtadvaita doctrine&rsquo;,-the day-break to the darkness of nescience before him, anon declineth wrangling waves of Casuists,
the</li>
<li>artartRe: That the souls constitute the Infinite body of God. This doctrine is peculiar to Visishtadvaitism or qualified Monism and reconciles in the most satisfactory manner, so far ever attempted, of the true relation of Soul
to God.
125
competing with each other to standardise their respective dogmas.
Guru.-Great king! These pedantic perverts, who blow their own trumpets by their blatant tongues, are eager to throw the gauntlet.</li>
<li>On the analogy of a &lsquo;Dog-Hog fight&quot; these ravishers of Vēdānta-Siddhanta, lead the attack, in company. Let therefore thy General check them, so that they may each in turn argue with our pupil.
Pupil.-53. (Smiling) A pre-conceived notion that Perception and Revelation are weaker than Inference, taketh hold of these contestants. But of no avail is Reasoning (i.e., inference) in arriving at Truth; therefore mere Reasoning is of little practical utility</li>
<li>A pack of dogs, though quarrelling with each
other, yet band together, forgetting for the time being their own mutual malice and chase a hog. Even so are the followers of creeds other than Vedanta-Siddhanta, who, though mutually differring from each other, club together when opposing the creed of Vedanta-Siddhanta.
126
in this world. Mind not the sundries; some wicked men, with conceit brimming in their minds, desire to overthrow, alas! the virtuous with arguments unworthy to be pronounced in an assembly. The foremost1 in this assembly and the foremost in the army, shall hear this
as well :-</li>
<li>Self-condemned standeth the mass of arguments adduced by these Casuists by their mental conflict with each other; their Sastras are refuted by the eternal Vedas. Now the contestants relying on mere bombastry, are no match for me, even if they bodily oppose me.
(Smiling.) Hallo! The blind lead the blind with the staff, and the lame carry the Jame!! Even so are these perverts, whose wits are blinded by the darkness-Karma, and who are the trusted counsellors of Mahāmōha.</li>
<li>Vivéka, the President (King.)</li>
<li>Vyavasaya, the General.</li>
<li>With
127
their oratorical effusions matching rills but swelling sudden under pour of rain,-bristling with vulgar slang, -and resembling shingles rattling in the mouth,&rsquo;-these (casuists) entice only numskulls who enthuse (over such effusions).
Ha! ha! These satellites of Mahāmoha flattering these orations, bring to our mind the jackals, belauding asses&rsquo; music.
King.-General! Direct, for debate one after another, these individuals, small-witted in that they flout at the Vedānta, pregnant with sense.
Senapati.-I shall call to order these senselessly
blatant men.
or</li>
<li>ie., slurring and indistinct pronunciation;
their arguments are as much not amenable to reason as the improbable tale that a person swallowed a rock, or as deceptive as a juggler feigning to eat stones-or it also may mean offering stones to the listener to eat, instead of food r fruit.
128
(Turning round and looking.)
Listen Oh non-Vedins and Vedamisinterpreters !</li>
<li>Stop now with your false jargon, dear only to the mean,-puffed up with mutual admiration but repugnant to the galaxy of savants. In troth see your methods lame before these truth-speaking lions of good men!
Pupil.-Blessed sire! Cast thy looks this way.</li>
<li>These men embrace corrupt dialects such as the Mahārāshtrā, Māgadhi, Saurasēni, Lāti, Gaudi, etc., which Buddha, Jina, and others, have passed off as Scriptures,dialects that are the laughing-stock (of the Samskritists.)
I also, nevertheless, versed in all these dialects, shall win these disputants by their own weapons; so goeth the saying, that
devils must be met by devils&rsquo; patois.&quot;
Guru.-Help thyself to language divine (ie., Samskrita) or non-divine i.e., Prākritic but
129
the divine would appear to be all-agreeable, for it seemeth to be so to the king, in all likelihood.
King. - Sire divine! Mightily bold is this minent personage, the object of thy grace.
Senapati.-What wonder !
1</li>
<li>Here stand (arrayed in glory) these Agastyas, who have drained dry the ocean-streams of these boasting casuists, captured by the demons of vain debate,Agastyas, ripe with the voice of wisdom, by sitting at the feet of the king of ascetics(=Rāmānuja).</li>
<li>The great tumult uprising from the mutually-contending and dry-discoursing elephant-army of these wranglers bursting with boast, and violating with vain talk the ways of the Veda, ceaseth, the</li>
<li>The implication is that savants versed in Ramanuja&rsquo;s lore will put an end to the notoriety of the followers of rival creeds even as quickly as Agastya dried up the ocean by one sip of his s. s. 9
130
moment Yatindra&rsquo;s blessed word is uttered, albeit casually.
Pupil.-Acting as I do in the presence of the
president (king) and the commander-inchief, and armoured as I am firmly by the grace-filled eyes of my teacher, what fear is there in this wordy-war?</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Now:-
Brilliant from my birth reigneth my intellect, and purposive. So it is by virtue of my Pontiff (-Rāmānuja),-the axe to the dreadful world-evil. Even the God-ordained great illusion-night can never bring sleep on me. drunk as I am in the nectar-drug, drawn from his (Pontiff&rsquo;s) milk-sea like sermons&rsquo;.
Besides :-
Unrivalled, have we all these days passed among the disputants, filling the royal courts of the countries, Tundira, Chola, Pandya, Kerala, Karnata, Nepāla,</p>
<ol>
<li>Sri Bhashya &amp;c.131
Malava, Gauda, Lāta, etc., and never were there brow-beaten. Walking as we do, in the kingly ways of the Vedas, and keeping as we do the company of good men, we are happy.
But why so contentious?
For:-</li>
<li>Let alone the fact that Sri Rāmānuja&rsquo;s followers have a spotless wisdom from their very birth. Let alone again the fact of his eternal works being by nature supreme, sportive and savoury. Who shall even dare to lift his eyes before my debate, conducted with a weapon-toweapon vehemence, in the war of words?
Senapati.Indeed!</li>
<li>What is achieved through the Acharya&rsquo;s single eye of grace or his two physical eyes cannot be achieved by the Three-eyed,&rsquo; the Eight-eyed, or even the Thousand-eyed.3</li>
<li>No other deem we our Deity, equal</li>

or high, than our Acharya whose tonguetip is bright, throne-made as it is by the Horse-faced&rsquo;, not even the Deity Narayana Himself, who,-His pristine glory unaffected-putteth on the Acharya&rsquo;s garb2, to uplift souls, sunk in the sea of Samsara.
Guru.-Great king! By polite speech alone, hath thy General managed these leading debaters of other creeds. Let them now range themselves (before us) one after another.
(Looking at the pupil.).
Listen, lad! the first to be is the exposition of the creed of the Sankhyas, approximating to the Vedanta</li>
<li>These adepts of the Sānkhya creed, viz. Kapila, Asuri, Panchasikha, etc. discriminating Matter and Soul, treat not of God. Sin-smitten (sure) are their minds.</li>

Pupil.-(Aside.) In the contest about to open, I must first enlist the sympathy of this audience.</li>
<li>(Aloud.) Deign to me, I beseech, oh! ye, who are bees in the lotus-feet of Murabhit&rsquo;, tapping therein the honey of Peace! (deign to me) that I may heartily regale your ears with the honey (of words.)
(Turning to the Preceptor, bowing, and hands clasped):-—
Sire divine! By thy command, let me refute these Sānkhyas.</li>
<li>Materially influenced, if ye (Sānkhyas) only admit Matter and Soul, how hath God-the Crest-jewel of Srutis by the hundred-offended? If by severe sophistry, the Lord (God) hath been ejected, let other swindlers swindle ye of your faith!</li>

Senapati. My lord!
134</li>
<li>These Sankhyas, of their obstinacy bereft, by this Arya&rsquo;s arguments, now categorise&rsquo; this Lord of the Cosmos (God) as the twenty-fifth, as the twentysixth, as the twenty-seventh.
King. Holy sire! If these Sankhyas have been won over to the With-God doctrine, grant them pardon and range them with the Vedāntins.
Guru.-Stop, great king! For, these Sankhyas, though God-recognising, do yet generally grant a God of limited power, as understood by the Yoga philosophy. Hence direct this Vedantin to confute them (on this score.)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

and Soul.
For details of categories, vide n. 1, p. 2.
Some count God as the 25th Category. Others count Soul as the 25th Category and God as the 26th Category. Yet others count Time as the 26th Category and God as the 27th Category.

King. He is already directed, sire! by thy
command.
Pupil. -68. These Sankhyas, read in the perverted doctrines comprised under Yoga, prate that God&rsquo;s sovereignty is but reflection. The fit rejoinder to these also is the Vedic creed which recogniseth for the Godhead, the attributes of knowledge, power, strength, etc.&rsquo;
Senapati.&ndash;69. Lord! These poor adherents of Sankhya, now chastened, may be dismissed. Let now the Arya be set to the refutation of the Kānāda doctrines.
King. He has already been so set to it (by our Guru) in the manner how best to overcome those who range themselves against Vedanta.
Pupil. Great king! I shall do according to
thy will.</p>

of &ldquo;non-being&rdquo; (or non-ens), and by controversions of the methods1 of the Veda, the notoriety obtained for the School of Kānāda, by an Ulūka2 setting up a teaching, hath now passed off into mere memory3.
Guru.-(Eyeing with regards.)
Pupil.-(As if laughing):-But let (our) king
mind this, the yet more strange !
King. What may that be?
Pupil. These followers of the Kānāda School postulate Moksha (liberation) as a stony condition, per contra to Divine Likeness. In that case, glory be to Kumbhakarna, and his curse&rsquo; prove a blessing.</li>

King.-Forsooth right!
Senapati.-Lord!</li>
<li>These Semi-Bauddhas (Kānadas etc.) have been brow-beaten by (our) Arya. Next have to be beaten these full (-fledged) Bauddhas who vituperate the Vedas.
King. (With doubt.) Arya! Art thou prepared to subdue these Bauddhas, adepts as they are in juggling arguments ?
Pupil. (A bit out of temper.) King! Acting under thy will as I do, all these combatants put together may fail before my single self.
Thus :&ndash;</li>
<li>The dull Vaibhāshikas&rsquo; boast that the cosmos is momentary: the Sautrāntikas&rsquo; infer the objective universe to be but modifications of the mind; the Yogacharās aver this same
cosmos as
unreal; and the rest (the Madhyamikas&rsquo;,)
Kumbhakarna, Ravana&rsquo;s brother, that he should enjoy eternal sleep.</li>
<li>Different theorists of the Saugata (Buddhist)
System of Philosophy.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>138
assert that all is unreal (even mind). Hence, their mutually-conflicting theories, self-condemned, stand before me, these (doctrinaires), denuded of their boast.
Again :-</p>
<ol>
<li>Stupid these, Dingnaga&rsquo;, etc., bidding for tusk-to-tusk (kind of) fight! But attend, your school-methods utterly collapse; for the Bauddhas fail in either case, whether, knowing what is to be taught, they venture on expositions, or unknowing-(i. e. in both cases, their argument for momentary doctrine fails).
Founder of the Saugata-creed. There is also an implication in this thinker possessing the strength of the elephants, supporting the direc-
tions ten of the Earth.</li>
<li>The meaning is this:-If the present moment vanishes giving place to the next moment, then the teaching of the present moment vanishes, and it is useless; again if the present moment is existent, and the future or the next moment is nonexistent, the teaching also becomes non-existent. Hence, as in either case, if the teaching is to

Hence ours is the victory,-let trumpets
be beaten !
Senapati. (Applauding). Lord! Hearing this Arya&rsquo;s tersely sublime and irresistible harangue, cordially appealing to the assembly, the vile Saugatas have fled in every direction, but Madhyamika alonethe leader of the van of the Bauddhasdisregardeth the accusation with temerity, parading his pedantry. He must in particular be uprooted for his bombasts thus :-</li>
<li></li>
<li>Let the Vaibhāshika&rsquo;s oration enjoy peace; to the Santrantikas, well-wishings; let the Yogāchāras leave their means of proof: let alone the adherents of Sankara &amp;c. who only follow&rsquo; them (Yogacharas). But here emergeth this Madhyamika, bursting with his ability to make and unmake theories of non-entity, the upholder of the monistic doctrine of negation, hard to
persist, the momentary doctrine must bo abandoned.
Accepting Yogachara&rsquo;s doctrine अन्यत्सर्वममदिति ।
