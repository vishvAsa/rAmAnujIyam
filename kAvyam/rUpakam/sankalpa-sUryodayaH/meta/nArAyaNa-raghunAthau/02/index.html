  <p>THEN ENTER SRADDHA&rsquo; AND VICHARANA.”
Vicharana,—With thy brow bedewed with beads of sweat, thou seemest as flurried as the cow to see her calf.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lovely are thy globules of sweat, resembling nectar from thy face-moon dripping, or in the lustrous Malli-blossom blown dewing, or from the noble creeper of youth budding,
Sraddha.-My beloved companion! With a wish to prosecute (to a good end) what hath been undertaken by her husband (Vivēka), who is firmly planted in the one-pointed</li>

verdict of the Upanishads, and who hath taken the resolve to combat the opponents (thereof), Sumati the faithful, the blessed wife of Viveka, hath, to symbolize the welfare (of the mission) sped to the hill of gems fringing the woodland of pramada, bidding me cull a cluster of lotuses golden, worthy to lay at the lotus-feet of Sri&rsquo;s Spouse (Vishnu). She there sits, heart full of joy, and I shall speed to Gangā as smiling with her freshes as Sarasvati, the swan in the lotus-face of the Lotus-born2.
(Gesturing fatigue of journey).</p>
<ol>
<li>When will the clear fair Mandākini,&quot; with banks on either side of its stream, fragrant with the odours of jasmine that creep up the Kalpaka-trees flourishing amidst cool ponds between, (when will this Mandakini,) alas! wear away the sorrows which, by (souls) violently whirled in samsāric wheel,&rsquo; are hard to bear?

Vicharana.&ndash;( Pointing in front).
Here floweth in our vicinity the Gangā Thou shalt rest for a while, to ward off the Sun&rsquo;s heat,-as piercing as the poignant words of a villain,-in the jasmine bower grown on an islet in Gangā that issueth flowing from the feet of Madhu&rsquo;s Conquerer (Vishnu) and rich with the odour of the honey of Kalpaka-blossoms, scattered by the gentle breeze as cool as the heart of the good, and then proceed.</li>
<li>In the self-same place&ndash;
The wind-tossed trees shower from
their branch-tops flowers prodigally redolent,-flowers fit to deck the fillets circling the locks of the ladies of Mahēndra&rsquo;s court, reposing in the shade,—flowers reminding the shafts of the great archer. Kama, the betrayer of the coyness of women. Sraddha. Be it as it pleaseth thee, my friend !
(Both sit down with ease.)
Sraddha.-Lo! Vicharanā! What brought thee
to this place ?
89
Vicharana. My beloved friend! Hear me.
Some apostates and agnostics, clever in establishing the doctrine of Buddha and Jina, have now been ordered by king Mahāmōha-irate at hearing the preparations of king Vivēka, assisted by his chief Vyavasaya,to perturb Jiva whose mind is now firmly fixed on Purushottama&rsquo;s (Vishnu&rsquo;s) lotus-feet, by diverting it to some other object, just like a tiller leaving his plough and running after a jackal. The rumour that these atheists surround the Jiva hath reached Sumati, our queen, who hath asked me to convey this news confidentially to the chief Vyavasaya, who is now closetted with the great king Viveka. I have now set
out to see this Vyavasaya.
Sraddha.—That the Perverts have joined hands with Mahāmōha in his enterprise is just like the asses&rsquo; song in the ghost&rsquo;s marriage. But mind not. It is no difficult task at all</li>
<li>Industry or Effort. 2. हालिकजम्बुकदर्शनन्याय
90
for our great king to overthrow the doctrines
of our opponents.
Vicharana.—Hallo! Sraddhā!
How thinkest
thou that the doctrines of several able apostates, pursuing the creed of Brihaspati1 and others, could be subverted by a single person?
&quot;
Sraddha. Thou shalt realise the truth of what I say, on the basis of the popular dictum
that truth alone endureth and untruth betrayeth itself in time.</li>
<li>Quick can Viveka overthrow the creeds of all Heretics like the rising Sun driving darkness dense, like the raging wild fire devouring the forest dry, the forest of the Vindhya range,-like the mighty hurricane blowing off cotton mountains high.</li>
<li>The School of Philosophy founded by Brihaspati
富翁
the main doctrine of which is :Enjoy whilst thou livest, for it is but blank after death.&quot;
&ldquo;Eat and live to-day, let to-morrow take care of
itself.&rdquo; &amp;c. See Paramata-bhanga by Deṣika.
91
Therefore the attempt of Mahāmōha in collecting a host of Perverts to conquer Vivēka is no better than that
of a stone-raft sought out for crossing the high seas.
Vicharana. Dear friend! Thy words have swift imparted courage to me, and my mis-givings have given way. I shall see my lady
after speedily executing her commands.
Sraddha.—Hallo! Vichārana! Thy level-headedness, and friendship as well, have been demonstrated. I will now gather lotus blossoms, and thou wilt betake to the royal castle.
Interlude ends.
(Both exeunt.)
THEN ENTER KING AND VYAVASAYA.
King.-General mine! This indeed is the best time for me to take stock of work done and of work remaining as regards Jiva journeying to the goal of Bliss,-Jiva

(Brooding for a while and sighing.)</li>
<li>In this perfect world, teeming mostly with ignoramuses, God&rsquo;s displeasure compelleth crafty men being born, to range themselves in hostile camps, to devise doctrines diverse, and by their inculcation to provoke wranglings many. In no way do these differ from the ravings of mengone daft.
Alas! How shall true Vēdānta thrive in this world pestered by (such) doctrines distractingly diverse, causing confusion worse confounded?
(Looking at the sky.)
Ah, thou vile Mahāmōha! By rendering the worlds three bewildered what hath been or what will be thy gain?</li>
<li>Where drugs life-giving have become scarce, noxious ones beteem the sea-girt earth.
To remove this pain, I shall resort to the Lord Almighty.
93
(Gesturing recollection.)</li>
<li>I adore the causeless and stainless splendour of Hayagriva, present as a pure mount crystal-made, depriving the agonies. of the worlds three by His dazzle, nectarlike,-Hayagriva whose neighing voice resembleth the Upanishads Eternal.</li>
<li>Further, may the neigh of Hayagrīvathe sum and sense and seat of Vedas, Sāma, Rig and Yajur,-of all obstacles the Remover, the surging swell of the sea of selfknowledge-efface my inner ignorance, caused by the clamour of heretics, conceited, combative and carrying a roaring trade (of theirs.)

King.-(With joy.) Genial soul. In all modesty hast thou rightly reminded me. With thee to aid, what yet remaineth to be done, I guess, hath already been done.</li>
<li>Let alone Sama, Dama and others, arrayed in hosts of hundreds and thousands, heroic enough to cripple Mahāmōha&rsquo;s gratuitous hate for me. Like unto Vishvaksēna, the all-devoted to Vishnu in the work of overthrowing Asuras, art thou (to me) the efficient tool to fell faiths, faithless.

<p>Siddhanta is here Sri Rāmānuja.
Vāda is here Sri Vēdānta Desika; Chronologically Sri Vedanta Desika was uot a contemporary of Sri Ramanuja but the faith founded by the latter was firmly established and amply improved by the former. Naturally enough the yearning to meet his preceptor was so dominant in the mind of our Sri Védānta Desika that the much-longed for meeting is arranged for dramaturgically in the discourse and criticism of other faiths that is found in the rest of this Act.

Guru. When a pupil, good and lowly, doth approach, what is there that cannot in its good time be imparted to him?
Pupil.-Divine sire! Victory by logomachic methods is by great sages forbidden. For, they say that he who gloateth over such a victory over a Brahmana shall be born a cursed&rsquo; tree in the burning ground. How else are our disputants of the opposite side to be vanquished ?

<li>Several are my disciples in this world who grasp more than what is taught, and who are adepts in the tenets of diverse doctrines such as those of Buddhism etc, mutually conflicting, but none but thou whom I approve and whose clear wit streameth full and startling, art sought after by the opponents to take up the gauntlet.

When there is a difference of opinion among our OWN adherents, thou shalt stand by a Sāstra common to them, but when the difference is with rival thinkers, by the Vēdānta Siddhānta; even here, there are five or six high-class works dignified by brevity and glossary composed by us under the inspiration of Achāryas-Parāsara, Vyāsa, Suka, Saunaka, Bōdhāyana and others. Wellversed in these works, and heart set on them, thou shalt employ authorities and arguments that will carry convincing joy to the assembly.
Pupil. So long as thou art vouchsafing to me,
I shall not in the least err.</li>
<li>In a mind elevated in character by the grace of the Guru, what (truth) instinctively flasheth can vanish never. But when wrong interpretations are fabricated even by Rishis or others, they shall in no time pass into limbo.
104
Guru. Lad ! Dreading the world-deluding sophistries (extant), I commend thee to close attention.</li>
<li>The fallacies established by ill-witted apostates and perverts, causing a momentary confusion even to (the intellect of) a council of adepts in (Vōdāntic) debate,-only connoting nonsense, genetic of false developments and as stony as the heart of women, excite much fear.
Pupil.-Divine sire! This dread concerning me can only arise from thy inordinate affection for me.</li>
<li>Breatheth there a man, desirous of wordy-war who dare challenge me to contest, whilst at thy hands I have received all knowledge, and whilst under thy commands, I am acting?

<p>Devoid of all defects as the Vedantas are, how in this assembly, can these follow the headless trunk, the Pūrvamimāmsa&rsquo; ?
This indeed is the decision of the spiritual scientists, the vanguard of all the Vaidika-societies; viz., that Vishnuvotaries abstain, as from sin, from Kamya Dharmas, and deeply engage in Nitya&quot; and Naimittikas.&rsquo; Hence, savants (like. Bōdāyana) postulate that Karma and Brahma (or Jnāna) Mīmāmsas constitute together but one Science.
Púrva and Uttara Mimāmsas, or the Karma and
Jñana Kāndas, constitute one Science. Hence
the former without the latter is a headless trunk

Verily do we blush to try conclusions with these. silly-talking folk, and feel as the person, who, when advising a dolt to have no &ldquo;Stage-fright&rdquo; (Sabhākampa), would (be silly enough to) himself blubber have no &ldquo;frage-stright &quot;&rdquo; (Bhasa-panka).
The three-world-saving Srutis them-
alms to
beggar,
would call him back, only to
tell him herself that she cannot on any account give him alms; i.e., the right of refusal was an usurpation by the daughter-in-law. Hence the application of this maxim here is thus:-The Bauddhas reject the Vedanta but the Advaiting call in the Vedānta to their doors again only to say: We have the right to reject you and not the Bauddhas.&quot;</p>

selves refute them best. The fourfold means of Moksha, these fourth-yuga Sanyāsins-pirates of the triune Truism, Vedic Chid-Achid-Isvara&rsquo;-assert, the wise mockingly understand antinomically thus :-
(1) For (Nityānitya-vastu-vivēka) Diserimination as to what is Eternal and what is not Eternal&gt;&lt;(Tatvā tatva-vichārabhāva) Want of discrimination as to what is Truth and what is not Truth.
(2) For (Sama-damādi-sādhana sampat): The good means viz. control of senses, internal, external, etc.&gt;&lt;(Raga-dveshādi sadhana sampat)=The means
of love,
hate, etc.
(3) For (Ihāmutra-phala-bhōga-virāga)== Abandonment of the pleasures of this and the world to come&gt;&lt;(Laukika-vaidikakarmanushthana-vaimukhya) Abjuration of doing good works, temporal and spiritual.</li>
<li>The Visishtadvaitic thesis of the Vedanta viz. Soul, Non-soul and God together constituting One Substance.
161
(4) For (Mumukshutva)-Love of Liberation&gt;&lt;(Bubhukshutva)=Love of lust.
-Guru-Good pupil! What good is it harping on
this ?
Pupil.&mdash;Holy sire ! (Then) I shall rebut the
other variants (of this Advaitie doctrine.)</li>
<li>If Bhaskara and Yadava-prakasa could be adepts in determining the real position of the Vedanta, what affront is imputable to the other protagonists&rsquo; (Jainas etc,) experts in expounding self-contradictions?
It is for this reason then
we hear that in the manner the Absolute Brahmanupholders (Sankara etc.) are held to be pseudo-Bauddhas”, these (Bhaskara and
Yadava) also are held to be Jaina-smacking Vedantins,</li>
<li>Buddha, Jinā, etc.,</li>
<li>Upholders of Brahman divorced of every attribute
-or the subjective Idealists.</li>

But this is the quintessence of all the Upanishads, (thus) :</li>
<li>The Bhēda&rsquo;-texts proclaim relative differences amongst the Verities”, and the holy Aikya-texts are significant by their relative Unity.
And to support to support
both these senses, other scriptural texts declare the Verity (to be) the Cosmos-Inmanent Over-Lord-the Lakshmi-Lord.

<li>Verities or Categories are

(b) Soul, and
(c) God, all the three existing as a Unity-inDifference, i.c., in Visishtadvaitio Unison, or
in indiscerptible relation together.</li>

Pupil.-Great king! All that, by the grace
of this Acharya.</li>
<li>What, by Kānāda-methods, → and Kapila-designed drama, what by Kumārila&rsquo;s jargous and Guru-tied knots, what (again) by Tāthāgata-rigmaroles and others&rsquo; ravings, was the world imposed upon, hath all now, by Yatindra&rsquo;s deliverances, been restored to sense.

Verity (Reality) Bhatta etc.</li>

Senapati.-My lord!</li>
<li>Master of speech, veteran of worddebate, victor over factions, this (Arya) meriteth honors.
Pupil.&ndash;General !</li>
<li>By this Acharya&rsquo;s grace, by this king&rsquo;s favor and by thy appreciation too, have I already been honored.
King.-Holy sire! Fair and sweet speaketh he.
Senapati. But then.</li>
<li>Him, the victor in this assembly proved, this holy Guru&rsquo;s disciple, dight with his (Guru&rsquo;s) love, I should like to . honor.</li>
<li>The blue lotus blossoms at the appearance of the Moon, like the red lotus, at that of the Sun.

Pupil. Great king! This holy sire deserveth it. Guru.&ndash;Thou too, (pupil !) by my mandate.
King. Holy sire!</li>
<li>He (thy disciple) hath stoutly defended Vedanta. He hath also spread the knowledge of Truth. Gladly, I bid diminutive Dindimas to be drummed in all directions. May he wear this gold bangle round his left foot, to serve as the toyish skull-splitter of those noisy wiseacre foes, firm in the faded farrago of their teachings.
(Thus saying presents the bangle.)
Pupil.&ndash;(Turns to the Guru-for permission—-)
Guru. -So be it. Irrefragable forsooth is the
King&rsquo;s fiat.
Pupil. With thy permission, holy sire!
(So saying accepts the bangle.)
Guru.-Long-lived! Attend to this, what hence-
forward thou shalt do:-</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A species of kettle-drum.
166</p>
<ol>
<li>Coveting no honor, fame or wealth, gracious unto (thy) disciples, eager to learn, be engaged, as long as thy body lasteth, in the promulgation of the SārīrakaScience1, supported by sound logic.
Pupil.-Aye, as the holy sire directeth.
( Behind the curtain.)
Avaunt! A vaunt! &lsquo;Sdeath!
disaster hath befallen!
What
For:
**</li>
<li>These demons of dolts, Mōha&rsquo;s slaves, called Rāga and Dvesha (Lust and Hate), afore referred to have emerged, in order (after all) to bind irresistibly Virakti2 with Vishnu-bhakti”.
(Alarmed, all listen.)
King. Holy sire! In our attempt to suppress (ghosts), those very ghosts start up;</li>
<li>The Brahma-Sūtras and their right Commen-
taries based on the Upanishads. Dispassion or Renunciation.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Devotion or Love to Vishnu.
167
Endeavour for what best may be done for -success. We shall also now strive to
totally uproot our foes&rsquo; might.
