  <p>THEN ENTER RAGAL-AND DVESHA”.
Raga. Friend! With thee for my help, the achievement of my master&rsquo;s mission, I fancy, as (already) accomplished.
Dvesha.-Companion! I am in the same boat with thee, as I am ordered by his Majesty to create obstacles against the efforts of Vivēka, who worketh against thee.
Raga.—Friend ! Other, mandates (too) there

Lust-Attachment to wordliness.</p>

<li></li>
</ol>
<p>169</p>
<ol>
<li>Now that the heretics have been overthrown through the manœuvre of Viveka, the way to Trivarga&quot; is the only outlet for Mahāmōha&rsquo;s energies. Beggarly Virakti&rsquo;, I shall just decoy to a distance, and thou shalt entice Vishnu-bhakti all
at once.
Their disjunction with Jiva can be, by all means, effected, by casting the nets of making Svarga appear worthy and Mōksha unworthy, in all places. Expert as I am in a thousand and one deceits, I shall just beguile the beggarly Virakti, as Mārīcha
Buddhists and others.</li>

Dispassion or Renunciation,
Love or Devotion to Vishnu.</p>
<ol>
<li>The allusion is to the well known incident of Māricha being asked by Ravana to decoy Sri Rama into the Danḍaka forest. Māricha assumed the form of a golden deer and appeared in the vicinity of Sita, who, onchanted by its charming appearance, persisted in Rāma catching the same. Rama was decoyed to a distance by Māricha, when Ravana enticed away Sita. (āranya-Kanda-Sri Rāmāyana.)

did Mithili&rsquo; and thou shalt entice VishnuBhakti as Pōulastya2 did.
Dvesha. Then what?
Raga. -True, the Teacher of Vēdānta Siddhānta hath routed the head-less Pūrvamimāmsakās, the foremost of the wishers, of Mahāmōha&rsquo;s success-the very Purōbits of demon Hiranya as it were re-incarnate on earth, yet I shall propound their very creed ingeniously and thus accomplish my
master&rsquo;s mission.
Dvesha. Rightly opportune is thy resolve to stand by the victorious banner of the arch-chiefs of Mahamoha promoting Atheism, viz., the creed of Nirisvara Mīmāmsa.

<li>Materialism denying the God-head.
171
after the paltry and ephemeral pleasures&rsquo; how can dispassion possess one who longeth for endless and eternal joy ?2</li>
<li>It is mistaken to aver that beatitude
is Self-realisation; but if beatitude be one intercoursing with another, then what else but Kāma can best constitute what is called beatitude (Moksha), coveted by one and all? Beatitude therefore can be no other than Svarga, the seat of all (carnal) enjoyments at will, and this view is supported by the authority of our betters, the NirisvaraMīmāmsakas (Godless philosophers).
Dvesha. Indeed! It is this that is accepted to be the final decision, arrived at after a careful study of the traditions of Mahāmōha, by savants well-versed in Mahāmōha&rsquo;s lore*.</li>
<li>Enjoyment of Svarga, etc,</li>

<li>Misery is expelled not, if beatitude be the attainment of Glory (Brahman) conjoined again with mind (soul) and matter (non-soul).&rsquo; But if beatitude be the attainment of Glory (Brahman), denuded of all this, then it is no joy at all. And then the Vedic conclusion becometh but a mere verbal expression.
Raga.-Well spoken, friend! Like the exodus
of the swarm of birds from their nests in the hollow of a branch of a tree, burning with wild fire, surely this utterance of thine will drive Vishnu-bhakti to
a distance. How now is this stupid Vivēka going to create for Jiva a diversion from Samsāra,-Jiva whose mind is blinded by his eagerness for enjoyment eternal ? The</li>
<li>The attainment of a Brahman with attributes,
mind and matter (~the body of God) must still give one the continuance of worldly experiences, for according to the Visishtādvaita doctrine, God is never separable from the cosmos, for it is His over-united body.</li>

<p>An attributeless Brahman is only non-existent

inore that Viveka becometh anxious condemn the graces par excellence of damsels, celestial and mundane, the more shall he be bound firm by those ropes&rsquo;, (damsels). Just view the nectar-born, lotus-eyed, damsels, the ornaments of Svarga.</p>
<ol>
<li>Their bosom is beseiged by their everexpanding bud-like breasts: their eyes, stealing the loveliness of blue lotuses, long to tresspass on their ears; Hallo! possessed is their entire frame by emotions whose preceptor is Cupid (himself)! Methinks the whole universe is designed vanquished by the lovely seductive youth of slenderwaisted damsels !
But apart from the exuberance of fresh-blossoming juvenility, witness their amorous display!</li>
<li>Their eyebrows, Cupid&rsquo;s victorious penons, gesticulate that the true end of life is lust, their gait condemneth that</li>
<li>Also means qualities.</li>
<li>The period when maiden-hood and youth
meet.
174
every other goal of life is vile; their eyes, lovely with the moving pupils and excited by excessive passion, proclaim the truth of the Kāma&rsquo;-Sāstra that the only true Brahman is Kama (Lust or carnal enjoyments).
Dvesha.—(With joy and impatience ).
Friend! What a pity it is that even the erudite indulge in the unpalatable prattle that there be a bliss beyond the enjoyment of the celestial wenches,-enjoyment which is understood by some sages as Moksha itself,-the inark of the highest bliss, according to the votaries of thy creed who are thoroughly conversant with the relative differences of the diverse Ends of Life&rsquo; (purush-ārtha), and who always pursue (the End) Kāma !</li>
<li>How shall the All-sustainer2 be</li>
<li>of कामस्तदसमवर्तताधि.</li>

</ol>
<p>&lt;
If God sustains and permeates everything, it follows that he permeates sin as well and it is hence a contradiction to say that he is free from all sins.

175
uncontaminated with sin, and how againthe Lord, the All-Desirer1 be free from
desire ?
Raga.—Friend! This is not the whole of it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some fiendish people would dupe the simple folk and make them believe that the pair of breasts, honey-full, of lovely looking. damsels, surpassing the loveliness of golden globes, are but (lumps of) flesh.
(A voice in the air).
What saidst thou, Raya? What I said cannot be denied, for, only the blind behold not the purity of clear water !
Dvesha. Alas! Strange indeed is this attachment of the fiendish followers of Vivēka towards Brahman! Perhaps it is but proper-for, to the deaf, the cuckoo&rsquo;s cooing can certainly create no emotion. But never mind these, Vivēka himself shall be vanquished.</li>
<li>As evidenced by Krishna owning 60,000 wives.
176
For:-</li>
<li>The victory over Vivēka&rsquo;s adherents followeth as a matter of natural sequence from the victory over Vivēka (himself), for, doth not the creeper wither of its own accord when its prop-poplar is felled down?
J
Raga. Well conceived!
Dvesha. &mdash;{Laughing alond).</li>
<li>So long as I exist, surely this Viveka whose wits are blinded by wallowing in the barren regions of the Upanishads, shall never attain the faultless, blessed, matchless, adorable supreme Brahman,-Brahman that hath in Him the gift of all Ends of Life&rsquo;.
(Behind the curtain).
Who is that? Who is that?
(Both listen, with fear and confusion).
Alas! what mishap! What may befall us who are intent on executing our master&rsquo;s command? Alas! Our luck would seem to

<li>With his predisposition for a 80journ in Svarga, countered however by the frequent spectacle of the falls therefrom, the mind of Jiva doth engender in him an infinite thirst for the Para-Brahman&rsquo;. Even if this thirst at times becometh languid by mental weakness, it is again revived and it firmly establisheth in Jiva a penchant for either Bhakti or Prapatti2 according to his personal aptitude.

<li>Jiva, by sole decree of fortune, shall acquire an intense love for the ParaBrahman&rsquo;, engendered by the correct understanding of His Blessed Attributes, devoid of all defect, and shall know the natural difference in results, existing in the knowledge of the diverse Vidyas, the one as equally congenial as the other, like the different nectar-waves.
Then, the Jiva, like the bee, shall enjoy the honey of Parama-purusha&rsquo;s&rsquo; lotus-Feet</li>
<li>Supreme Lord.</li>
<li>Taking refuge on God.
182
and shall look upon even the Dēvacity as but a hell.</li>
<li>Here, the moment Jiva casteth away his attachment to Samsāra, on account of his recollection of his endless wanderings, an eager longing to attain the Supreme Brahman doth seize him through the knowledge of His singular attributes, and he then doth rightly indulge in the study of the several groups of sciences, relating to Godhead, pure, and devoid of all delusions and by discerning as to which of the manifold attributes of God are specifically dealt with and which not in any particular science (thereof).
O
I shall just dwell in brief on the &lsquo;methods of overcoming this illusion.</li>
<li>Moksha, reached through a knowledge of the different (God) Sciences&rsquo; is either one or many. If they are one, existence of several sciences is not justified,
the</li>
<li>Nana Vidyas the varied ways of divine medi-
tation which are 32 such as KENJA, etc.
183
as one of them alone may bring about Moksha. If they are many, there may be a durational difference etc., in their enjoyanent, like the difference attributed by the Mimāmsakās to the enjoyment of Svarga, and the existence of several (God) sciences is then justified. This fallacious argument-of the babblers who do not understand correctly the meanings of the Pramanas which re-iterate, that difference there is none, either in time or enjoyment in Mōksha, but only among the (God) sciences which treat of this end,-fails, through its lack of sense.
In spite of this, those who err, will -ever err. For, even if the. crows are washed with thousands of water-pots, they shall never turn white. The virtnons will with no hesitation understand the truth propounded by those who apprehend the truth of God and who abjure the whole conclave of agnostics, and will attain Sarvēsyara.1</li>

Sumati:-( With approbation) My lord !
Restored am I now, by thy language, disclosing a leaning for sound authorities. Umparallelled indeed is thy greatness in sifting the drift of Pramānas, by savantsrespect-worthy.
For :-</li>
<li>Now the Naga&rsquo; damsels, residing in mountain-caves on ocean-shore, sing aloud thy fame, which shineth like the moon, washed of her stain by the billows of the Ganga, on the crest of Siva, when he is disturbed by his dreadful Delugedance, and they get delighted at the perennial flow of nectar, exuding from each letter of the alphabet, making up thy praise !

<li>These (God) sciences, through the knowledge of a part of which, Jīva,</li>

tormented by samsāra-fire, doth feel that Moksha already percheth on his palm&rsquo;, even when this carnal body-the seat of all illusions-doth exist, thrive through the ever-expanding Madhusudana&rsquo;s grace that is so cool and clear, pure and pleasing, like the celestial waves of Gangā.
Viveka.&ndash;What sayest thou? The burden of
the care of Jiva is now indeed practically lightened. For, his Virāgya,&quot; springing from his desire to vision Brahman, conduceth in a greater measure to help towards (God) sciences, than that Virāgya which springeth from the knowledge of the ills of Samsāra.</li>

sciences, the Jiva performeth the Nitya&rsquo; and Naimittika&rsquo; duties for the sole pleasure of Para-Brahman, and delighted with the doing of these duties, he now hasteneth to fix his mind in Yoga, made blissful by currents of fresh nectar, flowing in the milky ocean of devotion, directed to the Divine Presence of the Para-Brahman-the Seat of all bliss.
&amp;</li>
<li>Further, when Jiva&ndash;abashed-museth in his mind about the unreal nature of sense-delights, resembling but a Gandharvacity, I stretch out to him my helping hand and he quickly tideth over the perplexities of mind and doth fix the same exclusively on the Para-Brahman, thus casily crossing the Samsāric-ocean, as if it did cover a cow foot-space1.

the whole truth, how is it that thou dost indulge in doubts, like a witless woman?</p>
<ol>
<li>A certain resolute person, who hath detached himself from Samsāra, renounceth all external sense-pleasures, as if it were honey-mixed poison, setteth his face against the finitely blissful Kaivalya,&rsquo; and even in this world evinceth fitfully an intense longing for the enjoyment of the infinite and eternally blissful Brahman.
It is but natural that a ripe fruit, which even an expert who hath climbed up the branch of a
a tree cannot pluck, falleth before a way-farer-a result of the strength of mere matured merit, expecting no effort on his part.</li>

If Jiva doth thus cross the Samsāric ocean, how then doth he (meanwhile)endure agony, like a worm in the hollow between the two ends of a tree burning with wild fire, like an antelope surrounded by a pack of hounds, like a caravan of traders in a ship tossed by a stormy tempest, like a jackal blinking in a flood-begirt islet, like a house-holder in dread hard-breathing at the ingress of a huge cobra inside the house, like the trunk of a rootless tree battered by the waves of</li>

<li>To the Jiva, who well discerneth the difference between Kamya duties, and Nitya and Nimittika duties,-who is not indifferent and who performeth everything after due investigation, and eager that no obstacles shall bar the enjoyment of ParaBrahman, even those causes of fear transmute to absence of fear.
Unaccountably then to assert that even the wise should indulge in fear till actual emancipation (is reached) is like trying to smell the fragrance of the lotus blossoming in the sky2.</li>
<li>To a person who perceiveth the possibilities involved in the perennial and strange windings of evil Karina, what not shall operate&quot; as the cause of fear, whether it be direction, or place, or time, whether</li>
<li>Caste, Order, etc.</li>

<p>No such fear has any foundation.
The implication is that everything will operate as the cause of fear unless perceived properly. of कालेष्वपि च सर्वेषु दिक्षु सर्वासु चाच्युत ।

be the body etc,-these though the means to achieve his longed-for object?
Sumati.If indeed everything be the source of
fear, then how shall Yoga, achievable only in the absence of fear, become successful?
Viveka.&mdash;Charming lady! Rightly hast. thou questioned. There is a certain subtle truth of which, though thou knowest already, I shall only remind thee. Listen then with attention undistracted.
Sumati.-Aryaputra! Proceed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Renouncing the Lord&rsquo;s grace, which is as it were the cataclysmic-fire to the evergrowing infatuation of the mind and which swalloweth the oceans of sin, riding a bad horse of Karma, is as futile as the erection of a salt dam across the brackish ocean!
Just hear the success, beggaring all description, of the person who betaketh
192
himself with one-ness of purpose to the grace of the Eternal Lord.</li>
<li>Longing seclusion, hating all sensedictates, all evil propensities for enjoyment suppressed by the force of Virakti, Jiva, the speeder in the path of Nivritti&rsquo;-path shall focus all attention and take refuge under Sri Murāri&rsquo;s feet and thus, transgressing Samsāra, attain liberation.
Sumati. Rightly so. I shall just ask thee who hast so thoroughly grasped the truth of truths one thing more. Why is not the realisation of Mōksha swiftly accomplished even by high-souled men with a thorough comprehension of the inmost truths of Upanishads, learnt at the hands of spotless Achāryas,-men who have uprooted opposite creeds, who have given up the tendency to indulge in Svargic, sojourn, who have set their hearts on the great bliss of the worship of Madhusudana&rsquo;s blessed feet,</li>

Sumati.&ndash;(Musing) Lord! Such indeed is the-
unique heinousness of the sin of insulting the true realiser of Brahman, so ably elucidated by thee.
Is there then no remedy for this sin?
Viveka,-There is but one remedy and that is seeking the pardon of the one that was insulted.</li>

Viveka. Queen! True. The ever-hostile obstacles to (God-) Yoga are indeed difficult to surmount. The attainment of Moksha will be unfettered only if these Yogaobstacles are prevented from appearing at all, instead of renouncing them after they actually occur.
