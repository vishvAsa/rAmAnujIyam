  <p>THEN ENTER DAMBHA AND KUHANA.
Dambha.&ndash;Halloo! Kuhanā! my dutiful wife ! I want thee. For, thou art my co-partner, by none unpolluted, as was Tārā&rsquo; owned by Brihaspati, and Ahalyā2 owned by Gautama. Thou wouldst not brook even a moment&rsquo;s separation from me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tarā, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship. The
Drama of Tārā Sasānka is too well known to be
reproduced here in extenso,
蠢</li>
<li>Ahalya, the wife of Gautama was seduced by Indra. The latter, enraged at this seduction, cursed his wife and transformed her to a stone. She continued in this stony state till Sri Rama gave her back her former form by the touch of his feet, on his way to Mithila..
249
Kubana. Thou, the best of Brāhnanās, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: &ldquo;As Arundhati&rsquo; owned
by Vasishta.&rdquo; Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself!
Dambha. (Smiling). Therefore thou art the
best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gúrhapatya” fire is extinguished.</li>
<li>Arundhati, the wife of Vasishta, is reputed to be ona of the unquestionably chaste ladies ever known.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A ceremony performed daily, both morn and eve, wherein the housewifo has to look to the unbroken continuance of Fire, all through her
life.
One of the three kinds of sacred fires pertaining to married life.

My Sthālipāka ceremony is similarly never interrupted, as thou concealest even thy menstrual course. Similarly again the Vaisvadeva and Pitriyajñya3 ceremonies are never interrupted. Where then is the occasion for expiation?
Kuhana.-Hush! Heaven forbid !!
&ndash;Hush
There is
need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas&quot;.
Dambha. Well, Kuhanā! Indeed, thou art</p>
<ol>
<li>A ceremony done with grain as the chief ingredient before the fire and completed on the full-moon day.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A ceremony done with oblations to fire after the daily midday worship.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ceremonies relating to departed souls.</li>
<li>Full-moon days when Sthalfpaka is performed.
251
my co-partner in life. Much I esteern thee, as thou dost maintain my Brahmanism, thou-my sacrificial wife-the lawfully wedded wife of a great Srōtriya&rsquo;. Always thou observest the Dvādasi&quot; vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivāsara3 days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret.
There now exist some Asuras, who have bid goodbye to all Dharmas, putting on the garb of ascetics, maintaining arguments tending to Māyā, seeming, as they</li>
<li>One well-versed in the Vedas.</li>
<li>The 12th day of the Lunar and the Solar fortnights
when Brahmanas take sumptuous meals early in the morning after a fast on the previous day. 3. That time of Dvadasi during which fast is
prescribed.</li>

unreality.

are, Kali-yuga itself incarnate. Thou shalt, at no time, leave my presence, seeing that these Asuras desire to entice thee, as Rāvana&rsquo; and Arjuna once did. None but thou shalt even for a moment serve me, the best of Brahmanas.
Queen Durmati hath, just now, requested me to practise some witchcraft on Vivēka, the desperado, who broodeth over some evil or other (to use) against our king Mahāmōha, the Lord paramount of all pleasures, both mundane and svargic. It is as follows :-
Well, boy Dambha! Thou
Thou who spoilest all the Dharmas of the universe shalt exterminate Viveka&quot;.
Averse as I am ever to desires, out of extreme civility, believing in the sages&rsquo; dictum-&ldquo;There is no sin in exorcising</li>
<li>Ravana carried away Sītā in the guise of an
ascetic from the Panchavati forest.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Arjuna carried away Subhadra (sister of Lord
Krishna) in the guise of an ascetic.
253
the six1 I have now undertaken the
19
vow to gratify an unknown deity. Fetch me therefore Parijata flowers and fruits, collected by Lōkapāla&rsquo;s&rsquo; Purohits&rsquo;, after their bathing in the waters of the celestial Gangā.
Kuhana-Fie! Fie !! Alas! How witchcraft could be practised against Vivēka, the master of the quintessence of all the Sāstras, well protected by his cabinet ministers Sama, Dama, and others?. They say that witchcraft practised in such a case recoileth on, and bringeth evil to, the practiser himself.

<p>twice-seven and four,
As also in the arts sixteen times four In time have I completed several
sacrifices with abundance of gifts, Implanted all over the world are my
virtue-proclaiming flags.
Ah, thou co-partuer of this most
virtuous self!
Let alone the eminence of my
erudition and good conduct,
Just think for a while over my
contentment.
After conquering the whole surface of the earth, Parasurama, in all humility entreated me to accept the same as a present. I, treating the universe no better than a straw, rejected the offer. The Lords of the immortals, surprisingly gratified at my glory, desired to give me Svarga and Moksha, but rich in serenity, I rejected this offer as well.
Kuhana. —(Musing).

The Vedantins state that, even those dear to the Supreme Lord on account of their aversion to sense-enjoyments refrain not from pleasures but indulge in diverse pleasures, eating, drinking, sporting with women, riding on carriages, etc, and this is the great virtue (of our faith).
