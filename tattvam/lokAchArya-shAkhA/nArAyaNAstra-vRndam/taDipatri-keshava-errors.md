CRITICISM OF “VISHISHTADVAITA VISLESHANA VIVECHANAM" 
At the outset, we would like to reteirate our respect for Shrl mAdhvAchArya and the gurus who succeeded him. That can be clearly seen from our Narayanastra blog where we have quoted shrl mAdhva's bhAshyas on various topics. The relationship between Vishishtadvaitins and Dvaitins is fairly amicable and has been so over the ages.   
However, it cannot also be denied that the two traditions are rival schools of thought and hence,   
debates have happened. In this respect, one can say Dvaitins took the first step in attempting to refute certain concepts of Vishishtadvaita -Vyasa Tirtha, Jaya Tirtha, Vijayendra Tirtha and Raghavendra Swami were among the dvaita gurus who tried to establish that some of the tenets of Vishishtadvaita were   
flawed.   
However, one upmanship such as "x guru authored a work refuting Vishishtadvaita last, so it means Dvaita is correct" is not sufficient to claim victory since a cursory examination of the criticisms of dvaitins belies a stark ignorance of basic concepts of the tradition. It is necessary to understand the   
pUrvapaksha to refute it, otherwise, one would be chasing ghosts. And this is exactly what the Dvaita gurus are culpable of. For example, claiming Brahman is negatively affected by “dehanAsha“ due to sharIrAtma bhAva or saying Vishishtadvaita proposes “equality” of jlva with Brahman are basic errors in   
outlining the purvapakSha and as such, their refutations cannot be taken seriously.   
Even so, we wouldn't have even embarked on this endeavor were it not for the fact that the author of   
"Vishishtadvaita Visleshana Vivecanam”, Shrl Keshava Rao Tadipatri, appears to be following the oft quoted criticisms of his gurus. Shri Tadipatri appears to be refuting some Vishishtadvaitin himself; it seems to be a debate of sorts between them, and this article is a compilation of his responses. However, we noticed that — 1) Shri Tadipatri lacks a fundamental knowledge of Vishishtadvaita, 2) The person he is arguing against appears to be a layman following Vishishtadvaita, who has also made errors in describing the philosophy. So basically, we have a non-issue here neither Shrl Tadipatri nor his opponent can be considered knowledgeable enough to attempt “refutations”.   
—   
However, even despite the voluminous nature of Shri Tadipatri's write-up, we felt a critical analysis of   
his work wasnot necessary. No-one is going to convert to another tradition by persuasion on the   
internet.   
We, the authors of the Narayanastra blog, have always reteirated that it is not in our interest to refute other darShanas. It is actually a tedious process.But we felt we had to write a response when we saw that Shri Tadipatri, in addition to grossly misunderstanding Vishishtadvaita, freely makes statements   
such as this:   
"What the Visiṣṭādvaitins did was labelling the pure devotees that were before Sri Rāmānuja as "Alwars" and falsely interpreted their works to suit the Visiṣṭādvaita position. Kulasekhara Maharaja was never called alwar before the advent of Sri Rāmānuja”   
This prompted us to address the issue because it amounts to mudslinging and slander. It is clear that Shri Tadipatri has no knowledge of Azhwar Aruliccheyal, either from a historical or from a scholarly perspective. Judging from this statement, we doubt he even knows thenames of all the azhwars! We request our dvaitin friends to refrain from such slander unless they have read all the commentaries on   
the divya prabandham.   
The following answers shrl Tadipatri's "criticisms". Note that our style of response is not intended to deliberately show dvaita is wrong, but merely respond to the charges. We have not gone out of our way here. Before that, an outline of Vishishtadvaita philosophy is in order.   
BRIEF SUMMARY OF VISHISHTADVAITA   
Asesha chitachit vastu seshine sesha sAyine |   
nirmalAnanta kalyAna nidhaye vishnave namaha ||   
Vishishtadvaita recognizes three realities (tattva traya)- chit or sentients (jIvAs), achit or insentient   
prakrti (mishra sattva and suddha sattva prakrtis) and Ishvara.   
Ishvara is sriman nArAyaNa, who is akhila hEya pratyanika samastha kalyANa guNAtmaka. Chit and Achit   
are both the body of Ishvara according to the shruti as follows:   
Ya Atmani tishttan Atmana: antaro yam AtmA na vEda yasya AtmA sharlramya AtmAnam antarO yamayati sa ta AtmA antaryAmi amruta:" ~ brihadAraNyaka Upanishad.   
antaHsharlre nihito guhAyAmaja eko nityo yasya pR^ithivl sharlra.nyaH pR^ithivlmantare sa.ncharan yaM pr^ithivl na veda || ~ SubalOpanishad   
Firstly, what is the definition of a “sharlra” or a body? In ordinary usage, it denotes the physical structures or forms of all living beings. The naiyAyikas define the body as the seat of sense organs, and the basis for pain and pleasure. This definition is faulty, as then it does not include material objects that   
can be bodies but have no sense organs. Also, pain and pleasure find locus in the self, and not the body. It cannot also be said that the definition of a body is "jaDa" since shAstra says "yasya Atma sharlraM”.   
SrI rAmAnuja defines "sharlra" as follows: "yasya cEtanasya yaddravyaM sarvAtmaNA svArthE niyantum dhArayituM ca shakyam taccheShataika svarUpaM ca tat tasya sharlraM" - "Any substance which a sentient self can completely control and support for its' own purposes and which is entirely dependent on the self is called its' sharlra".   
So, mere dependence itself does not make an entity a “sharlra” as even an attendant may be dependent on his master. Only when total control is exercised by the self and the dependence lasts as long as the substance endures,itqualifies that substance to be called a body.   
What are the implications of saying jIvAtma is the sharlra of paramAtma? The following relationships   
arise due to the sharlrAtma bhAva:   
1) AdheyatvA (i.e. being supported by a sarlrl): Existence of the sarlrA(jlva) is due tothe sarırl (paramAtma) i.e. sarlrl supports the sarlrA. In other words, without a sarirl, sarlrAceases to   
exist.   
2) niyamyatvA (i.e. being controlled by a sarlrl): Not only that sarlrA (jlva) derives its existencefrom a sarirl (paramAtma), it is also being controlled by the sarirl. So, sarlrA acts as per thewill/desires   
of sarirl.   
3) seshatvA(i.e. existing for the pleasure of sarlrl): Not only that sarlrA (jlva) is supported and controlled by sarlrl (paramAtma), it exists only for the pleasure/will of sarlrl, i.e. sarlrl is   
sarlrA'sMaster and the sarlra is his servant. This is the essential nature of the sarlra. It is not   
enough to say that the self is dependent, but the essential nature of being a “sesha”, ie, serving him and existing solely for his will, is brought out by sharIrAtma bhAva.   
All the above relationships apply to prakrti and the Lord as well. But since prakrti is insentient as   
opposed to the sentient jlva who can willingly serve the Lord, it (prakrti) simply exists solely for the   
Lord's will.   
When we say "exists for Lord's will", it does not mean the Lord, who is avApta-samastha-kAman, requires them to exist for him or derives some benefit from them. Rather, other entities can only exist in that manner as they have no independence, and the Lord simply accepts their services and makes them exist out of his krupa.   
The essential nature of the self is thus seshatva. The essential nature of the Lord is seshitva or   
ownership. The essential nature of the former is thus dependent on the Lord, whereas the latter is   
independent (for even if nothing other than the Lord exists, then he is the owner/master of himself,   
being dependent on no-one else. When other things exist, he is their master as well).   
In addition, another outcome of the sharlrAtma bhAva and that is aprthak siddhi - The jlva (sharlra) is inseparably associated with paramAtma and has no separate existence from the latter, much as the body is inseparably associated with the self.   
"sAmAnAdhikaraNyam” is also applicable due to sharlrAtma bhAva. Just as the self inside a body is referred to by the name of the body, all names belong to paramAtma which has everything as its' body. For example, “Jack” refers to the the jIvA associated with the body identified as "Jack". Similarly, all names refer not only to the various objects, but in their innermost analysis refer to paramAtma who has them as his body.   
Based on the above, we come to the following conclusion regarding the definition of a jIvAtma according   
to the shAstra:   
1) The jIvAtma is known to be finite (aNu) and sentient (jnAna svarUpa)   
2) The shastra describes the jlva as a sharlra of paramAtma   
3) This means the essential nature of the jlva is to be a servant (sesha) of the Lord   
4) As the shAstra says the self is jnAna svarUpa, this realization of "I-ness" is nothing but the   
realization of "seshatva", making "seshatva jnAna” the svarUpa of the jlva   
5) As all jIvAs are the body of Ishvara, all are seshas and hence, all have identical natures, ie, there   
is no jlva svarUpa bhEda   
6) If all are seshas and all are unchangeable in their essential nature, being bodies of the Lord, then the reason for differences between them is due to changes in their attributive knowledge which is affected by karmas, vAsaNas and ruchi-s.   
7) Thus the jIvA has attributive knowledge (dharma-bhUta-jnAna) as his inseparable attribute to   
cognize external objects.   
(Note: Lord also has DBJ being a sentient entity, but his DBJ is eternally infinite and unaffected by karmas. Brahman knows external objects through its' DBJ)   
The differences in jIvAs are due to contractions and expansions of the dharma bhUta jnAna due to karmas, which is explained by Saunaka Muni in srl vishNu dharma as follows:   
"yathA na kriyatE jyotsna malaprakShAlanAt manEh| doSha prahANat na jnAnaM AtmanaH kriyatE tathA....” (~vishNu dharma 104.55-56, quoted in srl bhAshya)   
Meaning: “As the lustre of the gem is not created by the act of polishing, so the own intelligence (DBJ) of the Self is not created by the putting off of imperfections. As the well is not the cause of the production of rain water, but only serves to manifest water which already exists-for whence should that originate which is not? Thus knowledge and the other attributes of the Self are only manifested through the putting off of evil qualities; they are not produced, for they are eternal"   
The DBJ is likened to the luster that issues out from the gem (self) upon cleansing of dirt (karmas).   
So, contraction of the dharma bhUta jnAna due to karmas results in lack of knowledge of one's true nature as a servant/property of the Lord. This is the "stealing of the atma” alluded to by smriti. A body is the property of the self, similarly the jlva is a property of the Lord. Hence to consider ourselves as independent or not his servant is a "theft" of the Lord's property.   
So, how do we attain that jnAna which leads to liberation? By realization of the sharIrAtma bhAva and hence, seshatva, which then results in a natural love of the Lord, leading one to adopt one of 2 upAyAs according to the shAstra:   
"bhaktyA paramayA vA-pi prapattyA vA mahAmathe prApyoham na anyathA prApyO mama kainkarya lipsubhihi"(~ Ahirbudhnya Samhita, pAncharAtra Agama)   
The Lord says that he accepts either bhakti yoga or prapatti, which are two independent jnAna viSeshaNa upAyAs, as means to moksha (though prapatti can also be an anga for bhakti yoga). Both these upAyAs are included in “nAnya pantha ayanAya vidyatE:”   
The description of these upAyAs would span several pages and hence we skip it. Interested people can   
refer to nikShepa raksha of srl vedAnta desikan where all objections to this have been answered.   
One realizes his seshatva being theessential nature which then allows him to develop a natural love of   
the Lord, which is then fostered by meditation on undertaking these upAyAs. Karmas are destroyed on account of this as gltAchAryan says:   
Tesham eva anukampa artham aham agyana jam tamah I Nashayami atma bhavastah gyana deepena bhasvata II (Gita 10-11)   
Extinction of karmAs by practicing bhakti yoga or prapatti leads to moksha. What happens in moksha? The DBJ, being devoid of association with karmas, expands to infinity, resulting in omniscience of the jIvA. This is mentioned by the Upanishads:   
bAlAgrashatabhAgasya shatadhA kalpitasya cha | bhAgo jlvaH sa vij~neyaH sa chAnantyAya kalpate || (~Sve Up. 5-9)   
Meaning: The proportion of the jlva is to be known as equal to one hundredth part of the one hundredth part of the tip of the hair. He, verily becomes capable of attaining infinity (dharma-bhUta- jnAna).   
The Chandogya says: sarvaM ha pashyaH pashyati sarvamApnoti (7-26-2)   
"He sees all" refers to omniscience. As svarUpa is aNu, it can only be said that with expanded DBJ, he is   
omniscient, which only implies infinitely expanded DBJ.   
"sarvaM" does not refer to the Lord here as others interpret it. This will be explained later in the   
document.   
What does the mukta do with infinite knowledge?   
Chandogya says - sa ekadhA bhavati tridhA bhavati pa~nchadhA saptadhA navadhA chaiva punashchaikAdashaH smR^itaH shataM cha dasha chaikashcha sahasrANi cha (7-26-2)   
He becomes one-fold, many-fold, etc. This statement says the mukta can assume infinite number of bodies in moksha. How can a jlva, who is aNu svarUpa, dwell in multiple bodies? Answer is, he doesn't. He remains aNu, but pervades these bodies by his DBJ and controls them by his jnAna. This implies   
again, that DBJ is infinite as otherwise one cannot control infinite bodies. Only the Lord who has vibhu svarUpa can manifest in infinite bodies and be present in them.   
What does he do with these bodies and expanded DBJ in moksha?   
Lakshmana says:Bhavamsthu saha vaidehya girisanushu ramsyathe Aham sarvam karishyami jagrathaha svapathascha the (~vAlmiki rAmAyaNa)   
LakshmaNa tells the Lord “ahaM sarvaM karishyAmi” – he will serve Rama whether he is awake or asleep. Service at all times, places and states is the goal of a mukta and is implied here. Being omniscient and assuming infinite bodies, the mukta serves the Lord in infinite ways at all times, places and   
states. The mukta has free movement in all worlds and he is unaffected by karma, so he can serve the Lord wherever he is, not just the infinite realm of paramapada.   
What is the outcome of such "infinite service" at all times, states and places in moksha?   
sOsnute sarvan kAmAn saha brahmaNA vipascitA ~ Taittirlya Upanishad   
The mukta enjoys all auspicious qualities united with Brahman. “kAmAn" here refers to the auspicious qualities, as the jivA, being of the nature of seshatva, has no other desire in moksha but to experience Brahman by serving him.   
The idea is we serve him, he becomes happy, we see his happiness/auspicious attributesand experience   
Ananda. The supreme goal is to see the Lord's smile on his face after receiving our services. Infinite DBJ to experience infinite attributes of Brahman leads to infinite Ananda and thus, there is "Ananda sAmyaM❞ according to the sutra:   
"bhoga matra sAmya ligAnchaa"   
Clearly says that the ultimate similarity is only in terms of the Ananda (Bliss) which is that of the Lord and not in terms of svarUpa. It does not mean the similarity is only in terms of enjoying Ananda that is limited for the jlva and infinite for paramAtma (thus implying Ananda bhEda) but that the mukta's highest similarity is only the equality of bliss with Brahman derived from experiencing his kalyANa guNAs and serving him. But there is no share in "jagatvyApAra" since the jIvA remains an eternal servant of Brahman and there is no equality of "status". In addition, the jlva's abilities to serve Brahman, the infinitely expanded DBJ, etc are all dependent on the Lord and happen by his grace, whereas the latter is independent.   
This, in a nutshell, is Vishishtadvaita. Let us now look at Shrl Tadipatri's “criticisms”.   
KEYS TO UNDERSTAND THE WRITE-UP:   
"PP" refers to "pUrvapakShin”, ie, the dvaitin, shrl Tadipatri.   
"Author" mentioned in some places also refers to the pUrvapakShin.   
"SD" refers to SiddhAntha, our reply.   
pUrvapakSha (PP) is mentioned in red. Siddhantha (SD) is mentioned in black.   
"DBJ" means dharma-bhUta-jnAna.   
INTRODUCTION   
The Author begins his refutation by proceeding to outline the aspects of what he perceives is the philosophy of Vishishtadvaita. In doing so, he has unfortunately made some glaring errors which seems   
to indicate an improper understanding of the pUrvapakSa. This is highlighted below.   
Additionally, the reader may notice that some words, phrases, sentences and concepts are repeated several times in places. This is only due to the fact that the pUrvapakShin often raises the same   
objection or different objections which have the same answer, that we had to repeat certain things. In   
addition, sometimes repetition has occurred because the particular concept is very important and it is necessary that it is understood clearly. In such a long document, repetition is not a blemish, especially when it clarifies one's position over an important topic.   
SHARIRAATMA BHAVA AND “DEHANASHA" OBJECTION   
PP: Visiṣṭādvaita says that the jīva and Brahman are same or nondifferent in the sense that they are   
equal.   
SD: Talk about beginning with a bang, this is a horrific understanding of the pUrvapakSha by the author. Vishishtadvaita does not consider jlva or Brahman to be same, non-different or equal. Though both are jnAnAndamaya svarUpa, the jlva is anu svarUpa or limited and possesses dharma-bhUta-jnAna, whereas paramAtma is vibhu svarUpa with dharma-bhUta-jnAna (henceforth referred to as "DBJ”). Even the intrinsic Ananda of the jIvA is finite, whereas brahmAnanda is infinite, but the jlva experiences brahmAnanda in the state of moksha, which results in Ananda-sAmya.   
There is no equality in status or prowess.   
PP: Visiṣṭādvaita says that they appear to be unequal because of DBJ not expanding to infinity - that is   
before liberation.   
SD: This is only partly right. The jIvAs are unequal to paramAtma regardless of whether their DBJ is infinitely expanded or contracted. There is never a time when the jIvAtma will be “equal" in status or prowess to paramAtma as the former is the body of the latter.   
The very expansion of DBJ to infinity is due to the grace of the Lord. The experience is of his kalyANa   
guNas only.   
PP: Visiṣṭādvaita says that when dharma bhuta jnana expands to infinity, the jīva becomes equal to Brahman. This happens in mokşa.   
SD: This is again erroneous. The jIvAtma's DBJ does indeed expand to infinity, but it remains subservient to paramAtma as such extended DBJ is only by his grace. Furthermore, the jIvAtma's essential nature is that of "seshatva" or servitude to paramAtma in the state of moksha. By its' DBJ, the jIvAtma only serves him at all times, places and states (which is the purpose of infinite DBJ) and experiences the infinite auspicious attributes of Brahman, and thus attains infinite Ananda, which again is dependent on   
Brahman only.   
PP: Visiṣṭādvaita says that the jīva needs the grace of the Lord for making its dharma bhuta jnana   
expand infinitely in mokşa, where the jīva has six qualities like jñāna and Ananda equal to God.   
SD: Almost correct. But wrong with respect to Ananda. The Ananda of the jIvAtma in moksha comes not from its' own nature. That is to say, the jlva does have intrinsic Ananda (experienced by kaivalyArtis desiring that bliss), butit is limited and not the primary object of experience in the highest moksha. What   
is experienced are the auspicious attributes of Brahman, which are infinite, and thus experience of   
infinite attributes with infinite jnAna confers infinite Ananda on the jIvA. Thus, the Ananda is derived from Brahman. With respect to jnAna, the jivAtma has “seshatva jnAna” as svarUpa. Brahman's inherent nature is seshitva/ownership.   
Let us now look at the objections raised against Vishishtadvaita.   
PP: With their understanding that jīva is the śarīra of Iśvara and that Iśvara is aware of the difference between Him and his sarīra, there is difference between Iśvara and jīvas. Iśvara and jīvas are sentient and prakṛti is jaḍa or inert and so they must accept 2) and 3). They must be accepting 4) as well as there is difference between one jaḍa and another no matter how similar they are. The difference between individual jīvas is our anubhava and I am sure that they will not seek identity between their jīvas and the jīvas of their gurus.   
SD: The difference between one piece of jaDa and another is temporary since prakrti is perishable. By difference, we mean difference in terms of svarUpa, we do not mean individuality is destroyed. Once   
the Universe is dissolved into the subtle state, one piece of matter is indistinguishable from another. Then when a new universe emerges as the gross state, it is not necessary that one piece of matter which was Iron once, now in the subtle state, should come out again as Iron, in the gross state again instead of say, stone. There is of course, always a distinct individuality in that two pieces of matter never merge to become one, but two pieces could be dissimilar or similar based on circumstances.   
With respect to jIvAs, the differences only exist because of karma and contracted DBJ. The jIvAs are intrinsically identical with the essential nature of seshatva, as reteirated by a shAstra vAkya quoted by   
AchAryAs:   
nAyam dEva na martyO vA na tiryak sthAvarOpi vA /   
j~nAnAnandamayastvAtmA shEShO hi paramAtmanah// ~(MahAbhArata, AshvamEdhika 43-13)   
The self is neither god nor man, neither beast nor tree. Its essential nature is knowledge and bliss and it is entirely dependent on the Supreme Being and exists solely for His purposes (shESha).   
Other quotes from srl manavAla mAmunigal's commentary on “mumukkshupadi”. (The below slokas are quoted by Vishishtadvaita AchAryAs and hence authentic).   
svatvamAtmaNi saMjna jAthama svAtmitvaM paramAtmani stithaM (~ Attributed to viShNu tattvam)   
Meaning: The soul's nature is to be property, Brahman's nature is to be the owner.   
AtmadAsyaM harEsca svAmyaM svabhAvajnasca sadA smara ~ (Attributed to viShNu tattvam)   
Always remember the soul's servitude and hari's inherent ownership.   
dAsabhuta svatassarvE hyAtmanAH paramAtmanaH   
nAnyathA lakShaNaM tEshAM banthE mokshEsi tathaiva ca (~ Attributed to Harita Smriti)   
Meaning: All souls are by nature servants to paramAtman. No other definition (lakShaNa) applies to   
them in bondage as well as mOkSha   
(Note: The first part of the slOka, “dAsabhUta svatassarvE hyAtmanAH paramAtmanaH”, also occurs in the mantra rAja pada stotra of Ahirbudhnya Samhita).   
These are shAstra vAkyas quoted by vishishtadvaita pUrvAchAryAs like srl manavAla mAmunigal.   
In the harivamSha, in the section on bAnasura yuddha, the shiva-jvAra after being vanquished by krishna says:   
ahamasurakulapramAthinAtripurahareNahareNanirmitaH | raNashirasivinirjitastvayAprabhurasi deva   
tavAsmiki~NkaraH ||   
Meaning: I was created by Hara, the destroyer of TripurA. Now I have been conquered by you. You,   
DevA, are now my master and I am your servant!   
The reason for saying “Hara, destroyer of Tripura” etc have several inner meanings pertaining to bhakti yoga, but that is not relevant here. Note that the jvAra, upon being defeated by krishNa, acknowledges his essential nature of being a "sesha" to the Lord, who is his master. This is not some temporary statement of submission, but a recognition of the eternal "sesha-seshi” sambandha between the jlva and paramAtma once ego of the jlva is defeated by the Lord.   
Individual jIvAs are distinct, but identical in nature. In the state of moksha, we attain the same level of   
Ananda (infinite bliss from experience of infinite kalyANa guNAs of Brahman) and omniscience as that of our gurus. However, in moksha, the jlva serves Brahman and his preceptors, who are the reason why he has attained moksha. Even if our jnAna and Ananda is equal to our preceptors, they are the ones who helped us reach moksha and thus they remain higher in status for eternity. Hence, thereis no equality   
with our gurus in status.   
PP: The assertion that Bhagavan has jīva as His body is apramāņika. Not only is there no pramāņa for that, it even goes against all pramāņas.   
SD: The author is refuting the Vishishtadvaitic interpretation of the Katopanishad mantra (2-2-9) which will be quoted later, by saying sharlrAtma bhAva is unsupported by the shAstra and apramANika. He fails to notice that the sharlrAtma bhAva is clearly delineated in the antaryAmi brAhmaNa of the brihadAraNyaka Upanishad as follows:   
Ya Atmani tishttan Atmana: antaro yam AtmA na vEda yasya AtmA sharlramya AtmAnam antarO yamayati sa ta AtmA antaryAmi amruta:" ~ brihadAraNyaka Upanishad.   
The Subala Upanishad also eloquently dwells on sharlrAtma bhAva:   
antaHsharlre nihito guhAyAmaja eko nityo yasya pR^ithivl sharlra.nyaH pR^ithivlmantare sa.ncharan yaM PR^ithivl na veda ||

"yasya Atma sharlraM” → This means that the AtmA is the sharlra (body) of paramAtma. In the above subalOpanishad quotes, “akshara” in “yasyAkShara.n sharlra.n”refers to the jIvAtma as well, since the jlva is indestructible. What are the implications?   
1) A body is dependent on the self for its' existence, as it is burnt to ashes/completely useless   
without the self.   
2) A body is inseparably associated (aprthak siddha) with the self, and has no separate existence.   
Inseparability indicates difference and hence, the body is distinct (bhEda) from the self.   
3) The body is controlled by the self and cannot ever be independent.   
4) The body serves (seshatva) the self.   
5) The self is the antaryAmin of the body, and the body has no purpose outside of serving the self,   
and cannot sustain itself without having the self indwelling inside it.   
6) All names which denote the body, denote the self (sarva-sabda-vAchyatva).   
Thus, the attributes of the jIvAtma are to be sustained by, controlled by, dependent on and servile to paramAtma on account of being its' body. It is not enough to say he controls the jlva, the Upanishads stress that he controls the jlva as it is his body, which gives it all of the above characteristics. Prakrti is   
his sharlra and also has all the above. But while the jlva is sentient and thus serves the paramAtma in addition to existing for his purposes, prakrti is insentient and it only exists solely for the Lord's purpose.   
PP:More over not even a tiny trace of sharIrAtmabhAva is present in the Katopanishad Verse.   
yathA = just as   
agniH = fire god or agni deva(presiding deity of fire)   
ekaH = only one   
bhuvanam prviShTo = entered the worldrUpaM rUpam = every form (of fire)   
pratirUpo babhUva = became pratibimba (of fire)   
tathA = similarly   
sarva-bhUtAnatarAtmA = One who is inner-controller(Lord) of all   
beings   
ekaH = only one   
rUpaM rUpam = every form (of Jiva)   
pratirUpo babhUva = became pratibimba (of Lord)   
bahishcha = also outside (meaning different)   
Where did "assumes separate forms in respect of different shapes" and "assumes a form in respect of each shape" come from?   
SD: The author gives the dvaita interpretation of the katOpanishad mantra. We have seen that   
sharlrAtma bhAva is mentioned in the Upanishads..Let us see the Vishishtadvaitic interpretation for this   
katOpanishad vAkya:   
agnir-yathaiko bhuvanam pratishTo rUpam rUpam pratirUpo babhUva /   
ekastathA sarva-bhūtantarAtmA rUpam rUpam pratirUpo bahiSca   
Meaning: Just as fire (yathA agniH), though one (ekaH), having entered the world (bhuvanaM prvishTo), has become such (babhUva) that its' form (pratirUpo) is present in every form (rUpaM rUpaM), similarly the one inner self of all entities (sarvabhUtAntarAtma) has become such (babhuva) that its' form of antaryAmin (pratirUpo) is present in every form (rUpaM rUpaM) and outside too (bahishcha)   
The Upanishad teaches the idea that paramAtma is the inner self of all. Fire element has entered into the Universe on account of pervasion due to tripartite combination. The fire is in all material things. Similarly, that one paramAtman pervades all entities in his corresponding form as antaryAmin (pratirupa) residing within all entities. He pervades them outside too.   
One must make a distinction between antaryAmin and antarAtma. The Lord is "sarvAntarAtma” in the   
sense that he has the jIvAs and jagat as his body and is the one bearing them as their inner controller. At the same time, he manifests as antaryAmin in each individual sentient and non-sentient thing in the Universe, and has that entity as his body in this state as well. Thus, antarAtma and antaryAmin are two   
forms of the Lord.   
pratirUpa in the case of fire refers to the modified element post-tripartite combination. pratirUpa in the case of the Lord who is "sarvabhUtAntarAtma" refers to his corresponding form as antaryAmin in different gross states. It is a simple concept and does not require the forcible insertion of a “bimba- pratibimba” vAda.   
A simple way to illustrate it - A jIvAtma enters a body and is called "Jack". The name occurs because of   
association with the body. At the same time, this jIvAtma is the body of paramAtma and the former is   
inseparably associated with the latter. So, it means paramAtma has entered the body (by being the antaryAmin of the jIvA) and is designated as “Jack”.   
The reason why antaryAmin is mentioned as pratirUpa of the Lord is because the Lord as the Cause is the Brahman having cit and acit in subtle form as his body, whereas the Lord as the AntaryAmin is the   
Effect who has cit and acit in gross forms as his body. The Cause is the Effect because the Effect is just a   
different state of the Cause.   
PP: "this assuming a form with respect to shapes" has nothing to do with shariratmabhava. Atma does not have a shape. So, sharlra does not assume a form in respect of Atma. Sharlra has a shape, but Atma does not assume a form in respect of sharlra.   
SD: Vishishtadvaitins do not use the word "shape”. I have provided the proper translation.   
The Bimba-Pratibimba theory of Dvaita is not valid because the antaryAmitva (inner controllership) of the Lord is effecitively explained as “yasya AtmA sharlraM, yasya prithvi sharlraM" in the antaryAmi brAhmaNa. This declares the absolute inseparability, dependency, inferiority and servitude of the jIvAtma without the need for image/reflectiontheories, which find no mention anywhere in the shAstra.   
That "pratirUpa" occurs in conjunction with sarvabhUtAntarAtma and refers to the antaryAmin form of   
the Lord.   
PP: Let us list four possibilities -   
1. Bhagavān is bimba and jīva are precisely Pratibimba.   
2. Bhagavan is like bimba and jīva are not exactly Pratibimba,but they arelike Pratibimba, in the sense that jīva has dependency onBhagavan and possesses some of the charactaristics of Bhagavan.   
3. Jīva is the body of Bhagavan.   
4. Jiva is like the body of Bhagavan in the sense that Bhagavānis inside thejīva.   
Both 1.and 2.do not attribute any flaw to Bhagavān. 4. also doesnot attribute any flaw to Bhagavan as it is drawing only acomparison.   
SD: 3) is correct. 4) is missing the real meaning of "sharlra". When jlva is said to be the body of   
bhagavan, it does not only mean he is inside the jlva. Otherwise, shAstra would have been content enough to say "Ya Atmani tishttan Atmana: antarO" without further saying, "yasya Atma sharlraM”. The definition of a "sharlra" is that it is supported by, controlled by and exists for the sake of the self dwelling within it. So, the essential nature of the body is to exist for the sake of the self, and thus the essential nature of the jlva which is the body of paramAtma, is to exist for the sake of the latter and thus "seshatva" is its' nature. This is the implication of saying “something is the body of another”.   
The best you can try to dodge the normal and obvious interpretation is by using 4) and saying "He is inside the jlva like the self in a body", but that again, yields the same meaning, for then, the fruition of the analogy would be that like a body containing a self, the jlva is supported by, controlled by and exists for the sake of paramAtma, thus having the nature of seshatva. For it is already explained he is in   
everything, so the body-soul analogy has to mean something more. Thus, even taking it metaphorically or in the way of an analogy, you end up with the same conclusion that all jIvAs, like bodiesof selves, are   
identical in their essential nature of existing for the sake of Brahman and serving him, ie, seshatva!   
Let us forget for a second that Bimba-Pratibimba vAda is a theory that does not even have a direct pramaNa like sharIrAtma bhAva. The theory itself is flawed as it fails to provide a complete explanation of the nature of jivAtma. “Pratibimbatva" of jIvAtma only explains the dependence of an entity, but it does not highlight what is the essential nature of that entity. A dependent entity need not necessarily be   
a servant of paramAtma, and thus, it does not establish jlva svarUpa. While mAdhvas aver that a reflection is “drawn" to the object, which apparently validates bhakti, the reflection does not exist to   
serve the object in all ways, states and places, which is the true nature of the jIvAtma (as per sharIrAtma bhAva) and obviously that which motivates bhakti. A reflection also does not love an image, so it fails to explain the love an upAsaka has for paramAtma.   
But the sharlrAtma bhAva, as outlined previously, establishes the atyanta pArtantrtya/seshatva of jivAtma which is to serve and exist according to the will of the Lord. Prakrti is also the body of   
paramAtma, but being insentient, it exists according to the will of the Lord.   
As seshatva is the nature of the self on account of sharlrAtma bhAva, love of the Lord who is his self   
(and he being his body) is but natural which will arise on such knowledge and hence, the self indulges in bhakti and kaimkarya.   
Thus, flaws do exist in bimba-pratibimba vAda. In fact, all the conclusions of this theory such as dependence of jlva on paramAtma, etc (excepting inequality of Ananda which is veda virOdha) can be subsumed in sharlrAtma bhAva itself, which encompasses every logical relationship between jlva and   
Brahman.   
PP: But the position 3. taken by Visiṣṭādvaita attributes many flaws to Bhagavān   
SD: It does not.   
PP: Bhagavan has one extra layer than jīva and so is worse off. Even granting that Bhagavan does not have any abhimāna for his body (namely jīva and other bodies of jīva), nevertheless, He is equipped   
with the bodies.   
SD: No idea what "one extra layer means".   
This assumes that bhagavAn gains something by associating with jIvAtma which is wrong. It is the opposite, he associates with the jIvAs and jagat, because just as a body cannot survive without the self, the jivas and jagat cannot exist without being inseparably associated with paramAtma. Him being their sharirin and them being his sharlra is what keeps them existing. In contrast, just as a self can exist   
without a body, paramAtma can exist without these two entities as his bodies. Thus, he associates with   
us for our sake, not for his sake. It is his causeless mercy and desire to make us exist. We have no independent existence, but he does.   
Bhagavan possessing them as his bodies does not affect him as he is "apahatapApma” by nature. Bodies only affect selves when they have karma. So what is the flaw in him possessing these entities as his body when he has no karma and associates by his will?   
PP: While going to mokṣa, jīva has cast off all his bodies, but Bhagavān has jīva as His body and so in a way He has eternal bondage of the bodies. That too in mokşa itself, He has as many bodies as the jīvas   
in mokṣa.   
SD: This statement makes a complete hash of the sharlrAtma bhAva and betrays a complete ignorance of how the concept works. Everything is the body of Brahman, be it sri vaikunta, jlva, prakrti, etc. He is   
the antaryAmin of the muktAs and nityAs even in sri vaikunta. At the same time, he is also manifesting before the jIvAs, in a beautiful suddha sattva form, seated in a golden hall, etc as the Upanishads say. This is a simple concept that does not require such a convoluted misunderstanding to “refute” it.   
Him having jIvAs and jagat as his body does not mean he cannot manifest in his own supernal form. And at all times, states and places, everything is his body. And him having the Universe as his body does not imply bondage as he is free of karma. The body-self relationship is not reciprocal, but one way. We need him as the self or we won't exist. He does not need us as his body, but assumes us as his body to make us exist due to his grace and for sport.   
PP: The jīvas have the property of dehanāșa (or destruction of body). Now the Lord has jīva as the body. Even though jīva has no destruction, his bodies are undergoing destruction. This means these   
bodies, which are also effectively the bodies of Bhagavān are also undergoing destruction. That means Bhagavan also has the flaw of "dehanāṣa".   
SD: Key word for paramAtma is "apahatapApma". He associates with his bodies by his own will and not out of karma.Thus, as "dehanAsha" does not affect him and indeed, as he is the one causing this "nAsha" by his own will, it is not a dosha, and he, being different from the body, remains "avikAra". Explanation below.   
The Lord not only has the jIvA as his body, but he also has prakrti as his body directly. Certainly, prakrti is   
subject to change and destruction, which is effected by the Lord. But unlike the jIvAtma which associates with its' body due to karma as opposed to free will and thus is forcibly affected by changes to its' body, paramAtma has no karma and hence remains unblemished despite changes to his body, which he has associated out of his own free will to make it exist and has no requirement from it.   
The subalOpanishad declares everything is his body (yasya pR^ithivl sharlra.n, etc)and then adds “esha sarvabhUtAntarAtma apahatapApma divyo deva eko nArAyaNa:" - Though he has everything as his body and is "sarvabhUtAntarAtma", he is unaffected by the changes happening to the body as he is   
"apahatapApma". It is to specifically clarify that him having the jIvAs and jagat as his bodies does not affect him at all that the Upanishad says “apahatapApma”, thus refuting silly objections in this regard.   
Since he has no karma, he is not affected by changes to his body which means that he remains "avikAra” which is "akhila hEya pratyanika samasta kalyANa guNAtmaka" at all times, places and states. Destruction/change of prakrti which is his body is thus not a flaw. This is because the Lord is different from his body, and association with a body is not due to karma, but by his own free will. And he is the one controlling such destruction/changes etc while remaining unaffected.   
Thus, shAstra statements declaring him to be "avikAra" only refer to him always being undiminished and full of kalyANa guNAs everywhere. His body does undergo changes as the shAstra does not deny that   
prakrti, which is his body, undergoes destruction and changes.   
The destruction of jagat which is his body is effected by his own will, and he is unaffected by it.   
shAstra says the Jagat is his body. shAstra accepts Jagat is destroyed by the Lord. shAstra declares the Lord is free of karma. Therefore, put these together and arrive at the conclusion that all these mean that changes to the body of the Lord do not affect him, unlike others who are under karma.   
Statements in the shAstra such as "AdityavarNam tamasaH parastAd" which declare his auspicious body to be golden and beyond prakrti refer not to these bodies (jIvAs and prakrti), but to his own auspicious body which he assumes out of his own will to exhibit his kalyANa guNas to his devotees. This body is "prakrti" but made of pure sattva, as opposed to the other, lower prakrti which is mixed with rajas and tamas. This body is also different from the Lord and again, it is not assumed for his own benefit, but for   
the benefit of his devotees. Even this body is capable of change, ie, like how the short statured vAmana became the huge trivikrama. It is the Lord, who is different from his body, being divyAtma jnAnAndamaya svarUpa with sakala kalyANa guNas as his attributes, who is unchanging or”avikAra”.   
PP: Not only jīva, but the Visiṣṭādvaitins also claim that Jagat is the body of Bhagavan. That means when the Jagat is destroyed during Pralaya, that also is effectively dehanāṣa for Bhagavan.   
SD: See above. The flaw of dehanAsha only applies if: 1)bhagavan has karma and is affected by it, 2) If the body is assumed by himinvoluntarily/forcibly like the jlva as opposed to free will, 3) If he has something to gain from the body, 4) If he is identical to his body, 5) If he cannot exist without the body. Vishishatdvaita accepts none of the above.   
PP: Sri Krishna says in Gita -   
avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanumāśritam | paraṁ bhāvamajānanto mama bhūtamaheśvaram || Gītā - 9-11   
SD: That refers to the fact that the Lord during his avatArAs is mistaken by people as human when in reality he has a non-material body during these avatArAs. It also refers to the fact that people mistake him to be acting out of karma when all his activities are due to his own will. No relation to the current   
subject, quite strange the author quotes it.   
PP: Since there are all kinds of animals, birds, trees and insects and other living beings, God having those jīvas also as His bodies, must be construed as having their bodies also as His bodies.   
(The author Quotes Gita 2-18 again on a mistaken belief to substantiate the "dehanAsa" argument).   
SD: Of course, everything is his body. This has all been explained patiently above. He has the jIvAs and jagat as his body as the "antarAtma". At the same time, he is the indweller in every living being separately, in every molecule even, having them as his bodies and is the "antaryAmin".There is nothing that is not his body.   
In addition,Gita 2-18 refers to the individual self under karma and not paramAtma. Again, no relation to the subject.   
BIMBA PRATI BIMBA VADA AND ITS PRAMANAS   
The author now addresses the concept of viSesa vs aprthak siddhi. He first elaborates the dvaita viewpoint in a lengthy manner and then eventually provides what he sees as pramAnAs for bimba pratibimba vAda.   
The following are the so-called proofs for the Bimba-Pratibimba vAda and my answers given as well.   
PP: Kathopaniṣat() says to says - agniryathaiko bhuvanam pratiṣṭho rūpam   
rūpam pratirūpo babhūva | ekastathā sarva-bhūtāntarātmā rūpam rūpam pratirūpo bahiśca || - Kathopaniṣat -2-2-9   
SD: This was already explained to indicate the Lord's entry (as the self of the jIvA) into gross states. "yasya Atma sharlraM” and “yasya prithvi sharlraM” in brihadAraNyaka Upanishad validate that AtmA, prakrti, etc are bodies of the Lord. "esha sarvabhUtAntarAtma apahatapApma divyo deva eko nArAyaNaH" in the Subala Upanishad states that the Lord is "sarvabhUtAntarAtma" and yet “apahatapApma", which shows that despite having them as his sharlrA and controlling them as the antaryAmin, he is unaffected by changes to the bodies as he is devoid of karma.   
PP: According to the first sloka of the bhagavata:   
ātmasṛṣṭi (3TCH:) - The Lord creates His own forms - which is like lighting one lamp   
from another - every lamp is full and so every avatāra of Lord is full. When one lamp is lit from another lamp, the prior one does not diminish.   
the Jīva sṛṣṭi (¶¶H:π ) - Jīvas are pratibimbas and so vāri (water) is   
mentioned. He gives bodies for his pratibimba jīvas.   
SD: There is no mention of "pratibimba” in that sloka. This is not a proof of Bimba-Pratibimba vAda but an elaboration of concepts perfectly acceptable to vishishtadvaita. Refer to the vlrarAghavlyaM   
commentary on the bhagavataM for the vishishtadvaitic interpretation of this sloka, it has no relevance   
here.   
PP: (More pramANas).   
cetanābhāsako jīvaḥ paramaścetano hariḥ |   
svatantratvāt svatantro hi naiva doşeṇa lipyate ||" - Kūrmapurāṇa   
"The tiny jiva is alpa cetana and just reflection of paramacetana Sri Hari, because He is independent. Due to His independence, even though He is present inside the jīva, He is untouched by the flaws like   
sorrow."   
SD: Translation is wrong. The correct translation is as follows..   
cetanābhāsako jīvaḥ paramaścetano hariḥ |   
svatantratvāt svatantro hi naiva doṣeṇa lipyate ||" - Kūrmapurāṇa   
Meaning: The jlva makes itself appear/shine out (Self-luminous) as a sentient (cEtanAbhAsaka) (on account of) Hari (who) is the Supreme Self (paramaH) and the inner controller of the jlva that is his body (cEtana). Due to his independence, even though he is present inside the jlva, he is untouched by the doshas (such as sorrow etc due to karma).   
"cEtanAbhAsaka” should be split as "cEtana + AbhAsaka”.   
The term “cEtana” clarifies that the jlva is of the form of a finite entity having consciousness (svarUpa jnAna) as its' nature and also has attributive knowledge (dharma-bhUta-jnAna) as an attribute.   
The term "AbhAsaka" refers to "making to appear" or "causing to shine out". It implies that the jlva is self-luminous as it manifests itself by itself. The AchAryAs describe the jlva as “svasmai bhAsamAnatva”   
- self-luminous.   
Shuddha sattva is self-luminous, but lacks “I-ness” thus it is insentient. In contrast, the jlva is not only self-luminous, but manifests itself to itself (l-ness) and thus is sentient. That is the reason for declaring   
the jlva is both self-luminous and sentient.   
The author takes the word "cEtanAbhAsaka” and interprets "AbhAsa" as "reflection". This is not right.   
Now, the jiva is self-luminous and a conscious entity on account of Hari. Who is Hari?   
He is "paramacEtana" -The word is split as "paramaH” and “cEtanaH". It is not a compound word as the   
author assumes wrongly. These are two separate terms qualifying Hari.   
"paramaH” – The Lord is “paramaH” because he is the supreme self and does not have anyone as his inner self. He is independent. This means that though he has the cEtana as his body, he is not affected   
by the body or bound by it. That is the implied meaning here, since the latter part of the sloka itself   
clarifies this.   
"cEtana" - This term means "cEtanAtma" and refers to Hari as the inner controller of the jIvA who is "cEtana" as mentioned in "cEtanAbhAsaka", with the cEtana being the body of such a Hari who is   
"paramaH".   
That is to say, Hari is the inner controller of the "cEtana” or jIvAtma that is his body. By virtue of   
sharlrAtma bhAva and sAmAnAdhikaraNya, terms denoting the body denote the self and thus, “cEtana" refers to the innerself of the cEtana (jlva) which is Hari.   
Although Hari is also a cEtana, the direct interpretation does not suit the context, as “paramaH” does not qualify "cEtana” here. Thus, it refers to the innerself of the previous entity referred to as “cEtana” (the jlva) and highlights that the Lord is the inner controller of the jlva who is his body.   
Calling Hari the innerself of the cEtana, clarifies that the jlva as the body is thus dependent on, supported by and subservient to the Lord who is his inner controller which again resonates with the latter part of the sloka.   
Also, being a “cEtana” (sentient) that manifests itself as “I” and the body of Hari, it establishes that "seshatvam" in the form of servitude (kinkara) and existing for the sake of the self (Hari) is the essential nature of the jlva as well. Whereas prakrti, being insentient, cannot offer services (kaimkarya). But as prakrti is also his body, it does have seshatva as its essential nature in the form of existing solely to be used as he pleases.   
1) The first part of the sloka is similar to the shruti vAkya "nityO nityAnAm cEtanas cetanAnAm”.   
The Lord is the indweller of the sentient jlva as he has the jlva as his body and thus theexistence of the jlva itself arises from him.   
2) Now, that sloka, anticipates a pUrvapakSha – "Is not the Lord affected by the jIvA suffering effects of karma, etc if he associates with the sentients as his body and dwells in them?", so, the next part of the sloka says, “Due to his independence, even though he is present inside the jlva, he is untouched by the flaws." This means he is devoid of karma and is supremely independent in the sense he does not derive anything from the jlva which is his body.So, even if the jlva, which is his body, undergoes changes in its' dharma-bhUta-jnAna due to karmas, the Lord is not affected, being devoid of karma. Ironic that the pUrvapakshin was bringing up “dehanAsha” earlier and his own quote now dismantles his argument.   
So much for "reflections".   
PP: brahmādiguṇavaiśeşyādānandādiḥ parasya ca | pratibimbatvamāyāti madhyoccādiviśeşata ||   
brahmādīnām ca muktānām sukham viṣṇusukhasya tu | pratibimbastu viplutko viṣṇoreva param sukham ||   
The deities like Brahma, are but reflections of the Supreme Lord Sri Hari. Their bliss is very little compared to the infinite bliss of the Lord."   
(Note that this not only tells bimba-pratibimbabhāva, but also refutes Ananda sāmya, more about that later.)   
SD: Here, we can say that the opponent atleast quotes something relevant since the slokas contain the term "Pratibimba". However, he ignores the context, he ignores the fact that "pratibimba" does not necessarily mean "reflection", he ignores the literal meaning of the slokas as well.   
The translation provided by the author is not complete and neither is it correct. Assuming these two slokas, occur together consecutively, the context is to delineate the negative characteristics of the bliss in samsAra and then to show that aspiring for the experience of Brahman is the supreme puruShArtha.   
He should note that those slokas do not have "pratibimba” in plural, so calling them "reflections" is not the intent here. Although "reflection" is the conventional meaning of the word "pratibimba”, it can be used in another way. Before I explain this, first let me give the pramANas I follow to interpret "pratibimba" in these slokas.   
Take a look at this slOka from the rAmAyaNa that uses the image-reflection analogy:   
rUpa lakshaNa sampaNau madhura svara bhashaNau bimbAt iva uthltau bimbau rAma dehAt tatha aparau (~vAlmiki rAmAyaNa 1.4.11)   
Meaning: Lava and Kusha have charm in charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of   
Rama, separately.   
Here, the image-reflection analogy is provided to show the identical characteristics of Lava and Kusha to shrl rAma. In other words, just as the reflections are identical to the image, Lava and Kusha were identical to shrl rAma (being avatArAs of shrl hari themselves, who else would be his and Sita's sons?). Just as the image is the mula rUpa for the reflection, shrl rAma is the mula rUpa for Lava and Kusha.   
So, the analogy of image-reflection is used to emphasis identical natures of objects. Note that dvaitins accept it to some extent, as they claim that qualities of Hari are proportionately "reflected" in the jlvAS, but that is not the intent of usage here - not just partial or proportional identity, but *complete* identity of nature/qualities is emphasized by the analogy. Not dependence, not incompleteness   
COMPLETE IDENTITY.   
Now, that was one pramANa. Let us take a look at the second:   
pratibimbakriyAtigAya nama: (~shrl venkatesha sahasranAma, brahmAnda purANa)   
Meaning: Salutations to the Lord, whose Pratibimba (image/likeness) cannot be reproduced.   
Here is an example in the purANa where "pratibimba" does not mean reflection, but "likeness". The term emphasizes that there is none like the Lord, so his likeness or image cannot be reproduced.   
What is the purpose of quoting these 2 pramANas? It proves:   
1) If "pratibimba" in the slokas quoted by the author is taken as "reflection", it implies complete identity as per pramANa # 1, as Lava and Kusha are completely identical to rAma. This is not acceptable to him. It cannot also be said that complete identity is only in certain qualities as follows- just as the rAmAyaNa slOka references only the qualities of "charm" and "sweet voice" which are the subject matter and not in other qualities like bravery, etc which were not manifested by Lava and Kusha, there is only partial identity between Ananda of others and the   
Lord's Ananda. That is rebutted as follows - in the particular subject matter of the rAmAyaNa   
sloka, there is complete identity and to emphasise that complete identity, the image-reflection   
analogy is provided. Similarly, the subject matter of the slokas is everything that is mentioned (devAnanda vs brahmAnanda) and hence, complete identity only can be assumed, which is   
impossible.   
2) If "pratibimba" is taken as "likeness", as per pramANa # 2, it means there is no talk of   
"reflections" in the slokas quoted by the author. This is the route we take.   
So, 1) proves that pratibimba in the slokas quoted by the author does not mean "reflection" as it would otherwise imply complete identity. The author has not proven his position of bimba-pratibimba vAda yet, so he cannot say it implies proportional similarity of characteristics. Also, "pratibimba" is in the singular in these slOkAs and thus, as per 2), it is logical to take it as referring to "likeness" or "similarity/resemblance".   
Here are the meanings for the slOkAs:   
brahmadigunavaiśeşyādānandādiḥ parasya ca | pratibimbatvamāyāti madhyoccādiviseṣata ||   
Meaning: The bliss and powers of Brahma and others, due to their unique/peculiar attributes (of residing in their respective abodes/positions), also attain/become the state or condition of being the likeness/similar form (pratibimbatva) of desire (parasya), ie, anger, due to (association with) the triguNAs (upper, middle, lower).   
"brahmAdiguNavaisheshyAdAnandAdiH" - The bliss (bhoga) and powers (aishvarya) of jIvAs who are Brahma and other devas, arises from their "guNa-vaiSheshya” – this refers to their unique or specific   
guNas or dharmas. It means, the dharmas of residing in their respective deva bodies and also in brahma- IOka, rudra-lOka, etc which are specific to them and gained due to their merits. These "guNas"   
constitute the vehicles of enjoyment for them.   
Just as the term "dharmas" in KatOpanishad 4.14 (yathodakaM durge vR^iShTaM parvateShu vidhAvati ...) refers to devAntaryAmitva, manuShyAntaryAmitva etc of paramAtma, similarly “guNa” here refers to abiding of the self in a brahma body, rudra body etc and their respective abodes."parasya" - This refers to desire as per the gita slOka.   
indriyāņi parānyāhur-indrebhyaḥ param manaḥ |   
manas-astu parā buddhir-yo buddheḥ paratas-tu saḥ || ~ Gita 3.42   
Here, shrl rAmAnuja points out that “parataH" refers to desire and not the Self. The next glta slOka (3.43) confirms it, so one cannot interpret it as "self" here based on the katOpanishad. Since desire is superior to senses, mind and intellect, it can be termed "paraM” as a noun, in much the same way as the individual self, being superior to prakrti can be termed “paraM”.   
The idea conveyed by this slOka is that Brahma and others, by virtue of residing in their respective bodies and abodes, earned by their merit (puNya), experience bliss and great powers. But this bliss and these powers are derived from material enjoyment and as such, are temporary.   
When the enjoyment of material wealth gets exhausted, it results in anger.   
Anger is the result of desire as it arises from the latter according to the gita slOkas like kAmAt krodho❜bhijAyate. Desire leads to experience of sense objects. Anger results from not being able to experience the sense objects when they are exhausted.   
“pratibimbatvaM” – This means the "condition or state of being pratibimba (of “para” or desire) which is attained (AyAti). The term does not mean reflection. As mentioned earlier, "pratibimba" means "likeness". It means something that is of like nature or similar in form to desire. It is nothing but anger. While desire generates anger, both are the seed of Rajas or passion, with prakrti being the root cause. Both are enemies of the knowledge of the self, as they hinder it. Thus, they are alike in nature.   
The term used is “pratibimbatvaM” (not pratibimba), so it means the bliss and powers of samsArls are becoming or attaining the state or condition of anger, which is the like form of desire. Meaning, once the experience of those bliss and powers are over, there is anger and frustration at not being able to   
experience them continuously.   
"madhyOccAdiviSeshata" - Refers to the triguNAs (sattva, rajas, tamas) in samsAra.The idea is that the bliss and powers of Brahma, etc are associated with the triguNAs that constitute their bodies and abodes, and hence are innately limited and temporary in nature, leading to anger upon their exhaustion. Both desire and anger are of like nature arising from prakrti made of the triguNas.   
The implication is, bliss in samsAra, which is tainted by association with triguNAs, eventually gets exhausted on account of that and thus pleasure changes to pain (anger). So, it highlights the flaws of   
such samsAric bliss.   
So, there are no image-reflection theories in this slOka. “parasya” does not even refer to paramAtma here. The teaching is that the bliss in samsAra is temporary and not to be sought after.   
brahmādīnām ca muktānām sukham viṣṇusukhasya tu | pratibimbastu vipluto viṣṇoreva param sukham ||   
Meaning: The bliss of deities like Brahma (in samsAra), and those divested of desire to experience   
material objects and desiring to experience their intrinsic bliss (muktAnAm), is certianly of like nature (pratibimba) to that of vishnu sukha (all being attainable puruShArthas), but is contrary to vishnu's Ananda/to the essential nature of the jIvAtma (vipluta). The Supreme Bliss is attained from vishNu   
alone.   
One must note that the slokas quoted by the author from varAha purANa with "pratibimba" as above are clearly not elaborating a relationship between jlva and paramAtma. That is clear with the usage of "vipluta" as well. Various meanings of "vipluta" mean "contrary, perishable, lost, immoral"   
which can be used by the mAdhvas to describe muktAnanda or brahmAnanda.   
none of   
Rather, the intent of the slokas is to exhort the seeker to reject the pursuit of alpa-Ananda of others and seek the paramAnanda of vishNu.   
The context of the sloka is this - the Ananda of others is alike in nature to the Ananda of vishNu, as both are clear purushArthas prescribed by the Vedas to be attained. In the glta, krishNa says that 4 types of people surrender to him for 4 goals (puruShArtha) – One seeking wealth that is lost (arta), one seeking new wealth (artArtin), one seeking the intrinsic bliss of the individual self (jignyAsu) and finally the one who is the knower of Brahman (jnAni). All 4 purushArthas result in forms of bliss. Though all 4 are different goals, all these goals are valid puruShArthas and in that sense, they are of like nature. But the 3 goals other than seeking Brahman are contrary to the essential nature of the self which is "Seshatva" and also contrary to Brahman who alone is both unlimited and imperishable as a puruShArtha.   
In the above sloka, "brahmAdinAM" signifies arta-s and arthArthins together in one category as aishvaryArtis and their bliss is material bliss. "muktAnAm" signifies the kaivalyArtis experiencing the bliss of the individual self. Both these are forms of bliss and thus, they are both clubbed as one again to   
contrast it to the bliss of vishnu.   
So, discard the former Ananda and seek the Ananda of the Lord. Thus, the context itself shows that   
“bimba-pratibimba vAda” and Ananda tAratamya is not supported, for the elaboration of alpa Ananda vs brahmAnanda is to encourage pursuit of the latter, which implies the latter is achievable in moksha and   
thus negates tAratamya.   
"pratibimba" - In this slOka, the term is again used in a manner analogous to the previous explanation of the term, which in turn denotes the similar nature. Here, the comparison is brahmAnanda, with the Ananda of others. The Ananda of others is of like nature to that of BrahmAnanda, meaning, it is as valid and attainable a puruShArtha as that of brahmAnanda, being sanctioned by the shAstra.   
“muktAnAM” - Here, this does not mean "muktas” who are liberated in paramapada. The term “mukta” itself signifies freedom from any particular state or condition and does not always denote those in   
moksha sthAna based on context. Here, it denotes those who have freed themselves from desires for enjoyment of material objectsby quelling their senses and thus refers to "kaivalyArtis”. These "kaivalyArtis" are those jIvAs, who by their discipline, are divested of desire to experience material   
enjoyments and who have the desire to experience the intrinsic bliss of the jlva, which is superior to   
prakrti anubhava.This is a stage of jnAna yOga, and these people are not yet interested to experience   
Brahman.   
We have to take “muktAnAm” in the context of “brahmAdinAm” and the “sukha” experienced. Brahma and others are experiencing the bliss of material attachments. In that context, “muktAnAm” denote those who are freed of this particular quality (ie, desire for experience of material objects) by rigorous indrlya nigraha and thus pursue the intrinsic bliss of the pure self divested of prakrti.   
Vishishtadvaita recognizes two types of muktas - the highest muktAs experience paramAtma and attain infinite ananda, whereas the lower muktAs experience their intrinsic bliss which is limited. The sahasranama alludes to this by saying vishNu is “muktAnAM paramAH gatiH" - He is the highest or most excellent goal of the muktAs, which also implies there is a lower or less excellent goal for muktAs, as otherwise "paramAH” is not needed.   
An additional pramANa for a lower mukti is seen in the vishNu purANa:   
yoginAmamritam sthanam swAtmasantOSha karinAm|| ~ (vishNu purANa 1.6.38)   
Meaning: That is the eternal world of those yogins who are satisfied with the bliss of their   
own selves.   
That this statement does not – 1) Refer to the highest abode, 2) Does not support the author's theories of moksha being svarUpAnanda, and 3) that it only refers to kaivalya mukti - is seen by the very next   
statement of the vishNu purANa:   
EkAntinah sadA brahmadhyAyinO yOginaScha yE|   
tESAm tatparam sthanam yadvai paSyanti sUrayah || ~ (vishNu purANa 1.6.39).   
This sloka says that for those yogins who constantly meditate upon the Supreme Brahman alone, considering him alone as the means and the goal (ekAntins), is reserved that Supreme Abode of his where the nityasUris perpetually perceive and enjoy him (as opposed to the yogis who meditate on their intrinsic bliss in the lower sthAnaM).   
The usage of "ekAntins" and "sadA brahmadhyAyinO"shows that these yOgins who are constantly meditating on Brahman are different from those yogins of the previous slOka who are content with the bliss of their own individual selves. If the two slOkAs were talking about the same type of people, there would be no need to add “ekAntinaH sadA brahmadhyAyinO” in the second slOka, or it would have been   
used in the first sloka.   
The usage of "tatparaM sthAnaM” (that highest abode) qualified by "sUraya:" (nitya sUrls perceiving Brahman) differentiates it from the previous "amritaM sthAnaM" which is a lower state of mukti.   
Of course, it is quite possible that this lower moksha, which is past viraja but not in srl vaikuntha, is still empty, for by the grace of paramAtma, these aspirants are converted to develop a love for vishnu and abandon the pursuit of intrinsic bliss before its' too late!vishNu loves the jIvAs too much to desert them!   
Before a kaivalyArti attains this lower mukti, he first travels to the north and beyond the saptarishis and where dhruva is, to the viShNupada, that radiant region of viShNu, contemplated by yogins (even kaivalyArtins, though not considering the Lord as the goal, initially need the Lord's grace and him to be the means to achieve their goal of AtmAnubhava). This is considered the heart-region of the   
virATpurusha and viShNu resides here. This is the third celestial abode of viShNu from the earth, below satyaloka. yOgins, who are bereft of worldly passions, meditating on the paramAtma (as a means to attain AtmAnubhava and not in love of him), have shed their merits and demerits (to the necessary level), reach this station, which is superior to svarga in pleasure. They attain mukti (the lower one) if they continue their meditation on the bliss of the jIvAtma and are not diverted to loving contemplation of paramAtma. But by the grace of paramAtma, they do often switch to bhakti yoga, realizing their essential nature of seshatva during the course of AtmAnubhava. That is why some AchAryAs state   
kaivalya anubhava need not necessarily be mukti.   
Due to the above, it is quite possible to take "muktAs" as the kaivalyArtiswho have attained this lower kaivalya mukti and are experiencing the intrinsic bliss of their self. But the context suits better the interpretation of taking “muktas” as kaivalyArtis who are still in samsAra, in that viShNupada, engaged in the meditation on the bliss of the individual self, as the purANa slOka is exhorting these devas and muktas to switch to experience of paramAtma by pointing out the alpatva of samsAra ananda and AtmAnubhava. The following glta slOka validates this as well:   
catur-vidha bhajante mam janah sukrtino 'rjuna arto jijnasur artharthi jnani ca bharatarsabha (!Gita 7.16)   
Here, “jignyAsu” refers to those who desire to experience the intrinsic bliss of the self, whereas “jnAni” refers to the seeker of Brahman. It is not correct to interpret "jignyAsu” as “those seeking knowledge of Brahman" and "jnAni" as "those who know Brahman" because both are essentially jnAnls having the same goal of Brahman and there is redundancy. The statement of "chatur-vidha" is to differentiate 4 types of seekers based on 4 different goals they seek. Thus, "jignyAsu" refers to these kaivalyArtis described above, and in the purANa sloka as “muktAnAm”, ie, freed of desires for material enjoyments.   
The aksharOpAsaNa of the gita is describing meditation on the essential nature of the jlva only.   
In contrast to “brahmAdinAm” who are enjoying bliss of material things in the world and attached to the   
material objects, there is another set of jIvAs who are free of these desires and experience the intrinsic   
bliss of the jIvAtma. Neither group is interested in experiencing Brahman. So, this establishes the context for interpreting "muktAnAm" as the second set of jIvAs, and comparing the finite bliss of both these sets of jIvAs to the infinite bliss of Brahman, thus showing the latter is the highest purushArtham.   
To summarize, in this particular slOka, the word “muktAnAm” does not mean any type of mukti is achieved by these people. Rather, it is "mukti" from desire for experience of material objects which allows them to pursue the puruShArtha of the intrinsic bliss of the jlva as opposed to Brahma and others   
who are still attached to material enjoyments. If you want to take it as true mukti, then that is also   
possible as it can refer to the state of kaivalya mukti which is lower to the supreme abode of Brahman, but that is not required.   
“vipluta” – The experience or pursuit of the bliss of svarga, brahma, etc and the intrinsic bliss of the jlva   
is contrary to the essential nature of the jlva which is seshatvam. Thus, although they are a pratibimba (likeness in nature) to vishnu's Ananda in that they are puruShArthas, they are contrary and should not be pursued. The jlva, being by nature a servant of the Lord, is supposed to have no other purShArtha   
other than to serve the Lord. The jlva'swill should be aligned to the Lord's will. His Ananda should arise from experience of the Lord's qualities after serving him. He is an absolute slave, a property of the Lord and should have no independent desires. Thus, one should not indulge in activities against this essential   
nature such as independent pursuit of other bliss, not even to experience his own blissful nature, and such independent desires as per shAstra, is equivalent to "theft of the Atma", since the AtmA, being a body and thus subservient to the Lord, is a property of the Lord.   
Alternatively, "vipluta” means the Ananda of others is contrary to the Ananda of the Lord. Both material bliss and the intrinsic bliss of the self are limited in nature. The material bliss is perishable as well. Whereas the bliss of the Lord which is experienced by muktAs and nityAs is both imperishable and   
unlimited. It can be taken in this manner too.   
The phrase “visNoreva parama sukhaM” actually means that vishNu provides the highest bliss to be experienced. This refutes the objections that Brahman is not experienced in moksha and reteirates the bliss to be sought after and experienced are the auspicious attributes of vishNu himself. One should not aspire to experience one's intrinsic bliss or other material enjoyments in samsAra such as that of   
Brahma, etc, but seek to experience the svarUpa-rUpa-guNa-vibhutis of the Lord by serving him.   
The kaivalyArtis meditate on the amalatva, Anandatva and jnAnatva (jnAnasvarUpa and jnAnAshrayatva) of the jlva, with the understanding that the jlva is jnAnAnandamaya, but do not understand its' nature is seshatva-jnAna, as the sharlrAtma bhAva between jlva and paramAtma is not meditated upon. They do   
meditate on paramAtma initially, as a means to secure their end, just as an aishvaryArthi meditates on the Lord as a means for gaining wealth, but does not consider the Lord as his goal. But there is no loving   
contemplation which is bhakti yoga and an understanding of the sesha-seshi bhAva. In contrast, liberated ones in paramapada meditate on their seshatva and experience Brahman. "intrinsic bliss" is certainly included in the Ananda of a mukta in paramapada as he is an experience of all Anandas. The mukta understands it is seshatva-jnAna in nature; thus his experience of this bliss is by understanding his seshatva and he also experiences the blissful kalyANa guNAs of Brahman by serving him. But for a kaivalyArti, the seshatvaM is not meditated on and thus, experience of such bliss is against the nature of   
the Atma.   
The realization process of yoga is: 1) Realise Atma is distinct from body (karma yOga), 2) realise Atma is jnAnAndamaya (jnAna yOga), 3) Realise sharlrAtma bhAva between jlva-Brahman and that jnAna svarUpa of Atma is seshatva jnAna (bhakti yOga). KaivalyArtls arrive at stage 2) but get trapped in the intrinsic bliss of the Atma before proceeding to stage 3).   
Additionally, for further understanding of the concept of "kaivalya moksha”, one can refer books on the subject. It is too big to elaborate here. This much will do.   
Thus, neither of these slOkAs endorse image-reflection theories. Even were you to interpret "pratibimba" as reflection, then going by the Lava-Kusha-Rama pramANa, you have to profess complete identity and not proportional identity. For that matter, anger is completely identical to desire in its' nature too. But no need for semantics. "Pratibimba" simply means "likeness" or "similar nature/resemblance" here.   
Why stop here? There is another "pramANa" provided by the dvaitins which the opponent has not quoted here, as evidence for Bimba-Pratibimba theory. Let us address that as well. This is from the Hiranyagarbha Sukta of the Rg Veda. The statement "yasya chAyAmrtaM yasya mRityum" in the sUkta is interpreted as "The devas are reflections (chAyA) of Brahma (Hiranyagarbha)" by the Dvaitins.   
The above can also be refuted here. Firstly, "Hiranyagarbha" refers to the Supreme Lord and not Brahma. Secondly, “chAyA” means shadow in that verse. “amrta" refers to the individual self which is   
immortal and not the race of devas. The entire meaning is,   
Yasya chAyAmrtaM yasya mRtyum - "Whose (form of) shadow/death (chAyA) is the jlva (amRta) and whose (nature) is being death to the samsAra of his devotees (mRtyum)"   
"chAyA" is interpreted as shadow. It refers to death according to the bAlaki brAhmaNa in the   
brihadArANyaka, for a shadow is black and frightening, and thus is represented as death. Here, “death” means "the form of death", and the jlva (amRta) is said to be the "form of death" for Brahman. Meaning, as Brahman has the cEtana as his body, it is his form. And since the embodied self is subject to   
death in samsAra, it is meant that the form of Brahman which is subject to death or transmigration is the jiva, which has Brahman as its' innerself.   
But the question arises, is Brahman then subject to death on account of his body (cEtana) being subject to death? No, as evidenced by "yasya mRtyum" - His nature is that of being the death (mRtyu) for the deaths of his devotees, ie, he puts an end to samsAra. In other words, his nature is of being the means to liberation. Since the essential nature of Brahman is seshitvaM or ownership, that implies that it is of the nature of being the means (upAya) for all the jIvAs who are seshas by nature and his property. He is   
the means to liberation, and after attaining liberation, he is the means to gain eternal service.   
It is impossible to stipulate a tAratamya in the essential nature of the jIvAs, or a Bimba-Pratibimba   
relationship. For we have the pramANAs:   
Ya Atmani tishttan Atmana: antarO yam AtmA na vEda yasya AtmA sharlram ya AtmAnam antaro yamayati sa ta AtmA antaryAmi amruta:" ~ antaryAmi brahmaNa, BrihadAraNyaka Upanishad.   
Just as a body is controlled, sustained by, dependent on and servile to the self, similarly the jlva is controlled, sustained by, dependent on and subservient to paramAtma. This means that the essential nature of all jivas are identical as they are all his bodies and they all have that nature of seshatva as illustrated by a shAstra vAkya quoted by AchAryAs:   
nAyam dEva na martyO vA na tiryak sthAvarOpi vA /   
j^nAnAnandamayastvAtmA shEShO hi paramAtmanah//” ~ (MahAbhArata, AshvamEdhika 43-13)   
The self is neither god nor man, neither beast nor tree. Its essential nature is knowledge and bliss and it is entirely dependent on the Supreme Being and exists solely for his purposes (shESha).   
The above sloka is an explanation of what “sharlratva” implies, ie, “sharlratva" culminates in "seshatva” as the essential nature. The usage of "self" in singular implies the entire class of jIvAs are identical in nature, in so much as "rice" can refer to several identical grains of rice. In such a scenario, Bimba- Pratibimba vAda is inapplicable.   
Other pramANas for the essential nature of the self being “seshatva” are as follows:   
svatvamAtmaNi saMjna jAthama svAtmitvaM paramAtmani stithaM (~ Attributed to vishnu tattvam)   
Meaning: The soul's nature is to be property, Brahman's nature is to be the owner.   
AtmadAsyaM harEsca svAmyaM svabhAvajnasca sadA smara ~ (Attributed to viShNu tattvam)   
Always remember the soul's servitude and hari's inherent ownership.   
dAsabhuta svatassarvE hyAtmanAH paramAtmanaH   
nAnyathA lakShaNaM tEshAM banthE mokshEsi tathaiva ca (~ Attributed to Harita Smriti)   
Meaning: All souls are by nature servants to paramAtman. No other definition (lakShaNa) applies to them in bondage as well as mOkSha   
The above pramANas are quoted by srl manavAla mAmunigal in his vyAkhyANa for “mumukkshupadi” and by srl vedanta desikan in "srimad rahasya traya sAram”.   
As all souls are the body of Brahman, all have identical nature of "seshatva". Hence, there is no "svarUpa bhEda" to warrant any sort of tAratamya in essential natures.   
At this juncture, the opponent may argue - why can't we take "yasya AtmA sharlraM“ as a metaphor rather than saying paramAtma actually has jIvAs and jagat literally as "sharlrAs"? The answer is:   
1) Even if taken as a metaphor, it will mean paramAtma controls the jlva like a body (sharlra), which means that the jlva, like a body, is subservient to, dependent on, controlled by and   
exists because of paramAtma. This in turn means, like a body, the jlva is a sesha by nature to paramAtma. Thus, all jIvAs are identical in svarUpa and it yields the same meaning!   
2) "Sharlra" is to be taken as literal as it talks of sarvAntaryAmitvaM. Subala Upanishad also states that the Lord has everything as his body, and justifies the Lord as "apahatapApma” in relation to being "sarvabhUtAntarAtma". The shruti thus takes pains to show the Lord is unaffected by being the "sharlrin" due to being devoid of karma and on account of having   
everything as "sharlra”, he is “sarvabhUtAntarAtma”, and the purpose behind such a declaration is only because he is literally associated with everything as his body.   
3) Thirdly, sharlrAtma bhAva is prescribed for meditation in upAsaNa, is reteirated in smriti by usage of “tanu”, “vapu”, “rUpa” and other words (these pramANAs will be quoted later),   
and hence is literal.   
shrl vedAnta desikan says that it is not necessary for bhagavAn to literally dwell in the Atma to control it   
like a sharlra. But since shAstra is explicit in his literal pervasion and inner controllership, it is to be taken as literal. Compare the above points with mistaken quotations of the mere usage of "pratibimba". It is not rocket science to see that sharlrAtma bhAva is fully supported by shruti.   
But we do not deny completely that image-reflection analogies are used in shAstra. For example,   
consider this Upanishad vAkya quoted by shrl vedAnta desikan:   
Eka eva hi bhUtAtmA bhUtE bhUtE vyavasthitaH   
ekadha bahudhA chaiva dRshyatE jalachandravat   
Here, it says the Lord who is the antaryAmin of all beings, though being one, is seen as many in the same way as many reflections of the one moon in water. How do we explain this? Simple.   
shrl rAmAnuja infers that this analogy is explained as follows - Just as the moon, despite being seen in   
many water bodies of unequal sizes, is not affected by the differences in size, shape etc of the water, in the same manner, Brahman dwells in all sentient and insentient entities as the antaryAmin and is not affected by their doShAs and differences such as increase or decrease, sentience or non-sentience and SO on. Thus, the analogy serves to explain he is "akhilahEyapratyanika” and “samastha kalyANaguNAtmaka” everywhere, being "avikAra". The Self of all beings, though one, abides in each separate being and is seen as many, like the moon reflected in different sheets of water.   
To this, a purvapakSha can be raised - The moon does not really abide in water. What is seen is its' reflection. So, imperfections of the water do not attach themselves to the moon because it is not really there in water. In contrast, Brahman really abides in all beings and thus there is no parallelism in the analogy. To this pUrvapakSha, shrI rAmAnuja replies - The purpose of the analogy and comparison is only to show Brahman does not participate in the imperfections of the beings in which it abides as the indweller. So, it means that “Just as the moon is not touched by the imperfections of the water as it does not really abide in the water and thus there is no reason for sharing the water's imperfections, similarly Brahman, who really abides in all sentients and insentients, is not affected by their imperfections, as the nature of Brahman is essentially antagonistic to all imperfections and thus there is no reason for sharing the imperfections of the others". Hence, comparisons and analogies should not be   
stretched beyond their logical context. Normally, two things are compared for the reason that although they do not have all attributes in common, they have some attribute in common. For example: "Man is   
like a Lion" - here, the comparison does not mean that man walks on all fours like a lion.   
So, the analogy of the image-reflection is to convey that Brahman is not affected by the impurities and   
inequalities of the beings it abides in, just as the moon, which is seen in different water bodies of uneven sizes, is not affected by such differences in the water bodies.   
PP: In the following Brahmasūtra, the bimba pratibimbabhāva only is indicated.   
"OM ābhāsa eva ca OM" - Brahmasūtra - 2-3-50   
SD: Vishishtadvaitins interpret that sutra differently. The previous sUtra to this, according to srl rAmAnuja, establishes that the individual selves are inseparably associated with Brahman, are distinct from each other and of identical natures. Therefore, theories such as Brahman being deluded by limiting adjuncts etc. cannot explain how there is no mixing or co-experiencing in case of the experiences of the individual selves and the highest selves.   
However, the purvapakSin may then ask, “The fact that the experiences of different selves and Brahman do not get mixed up is due to the differences in the upAdhis (limiting adjuncts) caused by avidyA. To   
that, the next sutra replies –   
AbhAsa eva ca – And (ca), it is only (eva) a fallacious argument (AbhAsa).   
We need not go into further details, but the word "AbhAsA” means “fallacious", not "reflection". If we take "AbhAsA” in plural, it means that the various justifications of the purvapakSins are all fallacious.   
PP: On the other hand, there are no scriptural statements that say that Lord has jīva as the body or   
the universe as the body and there are scriptural statements that contradict the Lord literally having a body different from him. Thus trying to treat the Lord as "śarīri" by using statements quoted before will go against many scriptural statements and also turns out to be illogical.   
SD: It is very strange the author says this despite his tradition boasting a commentary of the Upanishads. Both the BrihadAraNyaka and Subala Upanishads quoted declare this tattva in no uncertain terms. To dispel the thought of it even being a metaphor, the Subala Upanishad openly states that the Lord is apahatapApma despite being sharlrin and sarvabhUtAntarAtma because of the sharlrAtma bhAva.   
There are no scriptural statements saying the Lord's body is identical with him.   
This only means that stray statements in the varAha purANa have to be interpreted based on the above understanding.   
ON THE TOPIC OF JIVA BHEDA   
PP: The Visiṣṭādvaitins themselves would not like to equate themselves with the jīva of their preacher Sri Rāmānuja. Much less would they like to equate the jīva of kalipuruşa or any other despicable jīva with that of Sri Rāmānuja. They are forced to accept jīva-jīva bheda.   
SD: We accept jlva bhEda in so much as each jIvAtma is individually distinct. However, we say that all have identical svarUpa of seshatva. The jnAna svarUpa of jIvAtma is nothing but seshatva jnAna.   
Differences between jIvAs are due to expansions and contractions of DBJ which in turn is a result of   
karmas.   
Of course, in moksha, the jlva serves Brahman and his preceptors, who are the reason why he has attained moksha. Even if our jnAna and Ananda is equal to our preceptors, they are the ones who helped us reach moksha and thus they remain higher in status for eternity. Hence, thereis no equality   
with shrl rAmAnuja in status, don't worry.   
PP: Gita Slokas 16.5-6, 17.2-3, etc bring out differences in jIvAs.   
SD: Those statements certainly refer to differences on account of being in samsAra. JivAs have sattvika,   
rAjasika and tAmasika characteristics due to different contractions of DBJ in association with karma- vAsaNa-ruchi. Those slokas do not talk of svarUpa bhEda. "svabhAvaja" is misinterpreted by dvaitins as "inherent nature" when it refers to ruchi. This is explained later on in this document.   
PP: OM adṛṣṭāniyamāt OM - Brahmasūtra - 2-3-51   
If a doubt arises that since all the jīvas are pratibimbas of the Lord, they all must resemble one another and must be the same, this sūtra answers that doubt saying that the difference is due to difference in their inherent svabhāva, samskāras and the consequent anādi karma, which are ādṛṣṭa.   
SD: The Bimba-Pratibimba vAda has already been dispelled with. The meaning for this sUtra is also   
different.   
The previous sutra “AbhAsa eva ca” determined that all arguments in favor of Brahman limited by adjuncts are fallacious. SrI rAmAnuja then adds, "the pUrvapakSin could then state the difference in experiences is due to the beginningless “adRhtAs” which are the cause of the “upAdhi-s”. To that, the   
reply is,   
AdRStAniyamAt – The adRshtAs which are the causes of upAdhi-s have for their substrate Brahman,   
they are connected to Brahman itself and cannot split up Brahman, which remains as one.   
And so on. We need not go on, but it is clear that Vishishtadvaita does not recognize those sUtrAs   
talking about Bimba-Pratibimba vAda or jlva bhEda.   
PP: Mādhvās clearly point out these well established facts from the scriptures. In simplest terms, one can go thru Gita and see them for themselves. Some of these Gita verses are pointed below (quotes several gita verses).   
SD: trividha jIvA bhEda is due to differences in DBJ. It is not due to svarUpa and does not persist in   
moksha. All the gita slokas pertain to samsAra bhEda.   
PP: Please note that eternal hell is not "permanent stay in saMsāra". If those two are the same, then our saMsāra must be termed as "short term super-hell".SD: Eternal hell indeed is a permanent stay in samsAra due to perennially contracted DBJ. BhagavAn   
himself says in the Gita that he casts the jIvAs into the lowest species, upon which they never attain him.   
And yes, our stay is a short term super hell indeed, if we remain as bhaktas that is!   
Hells like Raurava, etc are in samsAra only, are they not?   
PP: (Quotes several pramANams showing jIvAs reach hells) COMMENT: In fact the last three chapters of the Gita, the daivasura sampat vibhaga yoga, the shraddha traya vibhaga and the moxa sannyasa chapters clinch the issue of the jiva traividhya and by extension jiva jiva bheda for the informed   
reader   
SD: The informed reader will also note that all those chapters talk about baddha jIvAs with no indication   
that these differences persist eternally. Only in samsAra, as long as the DBJ is contracted and different for different jIvAs.   
The usage of svabhAvaja" refers to ruchi and not svarUpa bhEda. This is explained in a later section. Type "svabhAvaja" or "ruchi" as keywords if you want to skip to it in this document.   
PP: If one likes to see the enormous difference between the glorious interpretation given by Acharya Madhva and other Acharyas for the Gīta verse 9,32, here it goes. When others gave with the apparent meaning, which is not only ridiculous, but brings down the stature of the women of our tradition, the   
true purport is brought out by our Acharya.   
SD: The so-called "glorious" interpretation by srl mAdhva is wrong as there is no intrinsic bhEda sanctioned by the shAstra in the first place.   
This is a minor non-impactful difference, but even so, mAdhva's interpretation is wrong. The Gita indeed classes women along with other pApis, because those who do not have vedAdhikAra, are under some karmas which prevent them. This is prayaksha. In that sense, it is to be accepted women do have that   
inferiority. However, it does not exclude them from moksha sAdhana through prapatti and thus even srl rAmAnuja declares “equality of women", if you wish to look at it from a social context.   
Shri madhva's comments in this context:   
"The inherent nature, be it manhood, or womanhood, or Brāhmaṇatva or Kṣatriyatva, etc as per their inherent nature are retained in the liberated state, having fulfilled all prārabdha."   
...are wrong. Because, there is no gender bhEda among jIvAs.   
Such differences are due to differences in DBJ. The jIvAs are all like identical diamonds with varying degrees of dirt hiding their luster. Some shine a lot, some shine less. But in moksha, that dust is completely cleansed to an equal measure for all, and hence, they are all identical. Only seshatvaM is their nature and as per the vAkya "nAyam dEva na martyO vA na tiryak”, the self in its essential nature has no gender, caste or other forms of discrimination.   
In any case, shAstras should never be interpreted from a social angle. Be it varNAshrama or otherwise.   
PP: The slokas dont have any Bhaktiyoga and Prapatti and Sri Rāmānuja also did not make any effort to use those words in the commentary of these verses. So, trying to drag what is not in the verses and also not in the commentary of their Acharya is uncalled for. Sri Madhvācārya averted the disaster of demeaning and degrading the entire group.   
SD: Gita being the essence of the Upanishads, everything bhagavan says is related to - 1) Knowledge of his nature, 2) Knowledge of the jlva's nature, 3) Knowledge of the Supreme Goal, 4) Knowledge of the means to the goal, 5) Knowledge of the obstacles to the goal. Thus, every sloka is relevant to bhakti yoga and prapatti, which constitute the two different upAyAs practiced as means to the goal according to the following pramANa:   
"bhaktyA paramayA vA-pi prapattyA vA mahAmathe prApyoham na anyathA prApyO mama kainkarya lipsubhihi"(~Ahirbudhnya Samhita, pAncharAtra Agama)   
mAdhvachArya's distinctions between "inherent natures” are a-pramANika.   
Read the tAtparya Chandrika of srl vedAnta desikan before commenting on what terms srl rAmAnuja   
used and what he did not.   
ON THE NATURE OF LORD BEING DIFFERENT FROM HIS ATTRIBUTES   
PP: It is scriptures, which differ from Visiṣṭādvaitins.   
ānandam brahmaṇo vidvān,   
"atha eşa eva parama ānandaḥ"   
"ekamevādvitiyam"   
"neha nānāsti kincana"   
There is no difference between Lord and His attributes. There is no difference between Lord and His avayavas(or limbs).   
SD: Brahman is jnAnAndamaya svarUpa and also has jnAna and ananda as attributes. This is evidenced by the fact that shruti states “Anandam brahmaNo vidvAn" - Brahman is of the nature of Ananda, but   
also states "sa ekO brahmaNa Ananda:” – This is one unit of the Ananda of Brahman, thus saying   
Ananda is an attribute of Brahman.   
None of those shruti vAkyAs declare a non-difference between the Lord and his attributes or limbs.   
What a nonsensical interpretation. Let us study these mantras in detail to understand theie real context as well as meaning:   
sadeva somyedamagra AsldekamevAdvitlyam.h | (~ Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1)   
Meaning: Beautiful one! All this Universe of diverse names and forms was prior to creation only one Sath, the ever existent Reality, Paramatma and Non-Second.   
The context of this mantra is to describe the causal Brahman. The term "Sath" here refers to the   
Supreme Brahman qualified by sentient and non-sentient entities which are his body. The term "only   
one" (ekamEva) refers to Brahman being the material cause of the Universe. "Non-Second" or "AdvitlyaM" means there was no other instrumental cause, ie, Brahman is that as well. "IdaM” means this Universe differentiated into names and forms in the gross state.   
Since everything is his body, creation involves transformation in the sense that Brahman who had the   
sentients and insentients in the subtle state as his body, now has the sentients and insentients in the   
gross states as his body (after creation). Thus, there is material causality in the sense of this change in state. However, he remains "avikAra" as he is "apahatapApma" and distinct from his body. So, in this way, Vishishtadvaita establishes the material causality of Brahman without causing any changes to be attributed to him, and without resorting to tenous arguments of advaita, and without trying to dodge it by claiming "Lord is not different from his limbs" like Dvaita.   
Nothing remotely close to "Lord is non-different from his attributes/limbs" here.   
manasaivAnudraShTavyaMmanasA eva Aptavyam anudraShTavyam   
neha nAnA.asti ki chana | na iha nAnA asti kim chana mR^ityoH sa mR^ityumApnoti mR^ityos sa mR^ityum Apnoti ya iha nAneva pashyati yas iha nAnA iva pashyati || (~BrihadArANyaka Upanishad 4.4.19)   
Meaning: This Brahman must be realized by the mind alone after steady and constant meditation. In   
Brahman that is to be realized, there is no duality or diversity. He who sees here, as though it were many, goes from death to death.   
The previous mantra (4.4.18) to this referred to Brahman as the innerself of the panchajanasor sense organs and ether. This mantra thus describes how to meditate on this Brahman. So, one needs to understand this particular context before rashly giving interpretations like "He is non-different from his limbs"   
“manasaiva dRshyatE” – This relationship of Brahman (as the innerself of panchajanas and ether) is to be realized by pure meditation of the form of vivid perception achieved by the mind.   
"anu" signifies that this meditation should be preceeded by shravana and manana. If it is doubted that the one Brahman cannot be the support of the panchajanas as well the elemental ether, it is pointed out that there is no diversity in Brahman that is to be realized. The idea is that, Brahman as the innerself of the panchajanas is the same as the Brahman as the innerself of ether, and he does not undergo changes   
or become diverse on account of antaryAmitvaM. In such a way, there is no bhEda in the Atman. If one sees diversity in Brahman which is the ground of the entire Universe (in the manner of thinking Brahman   
as innerself of different entities undergoes increases or reductions), then he attains samsAra only.   
Similar mantrasalso occur in the katOpanishad, so let us see that as well:   
taM devAH sarve.arpitAstadu nAtyeti kashchana. etadvai tat ..yadeveha tadamutra yadamutra tadanviha mR^ityoH sa mR^ityumApnoti ya iha nAneva pashyati (~KatOpanishad 4.10)   
Meaning: What indeed is here (as the inner self in the self) is the same which is yonder (as the self of   
all the other worlds). That which is yonder is here. He who sees here (in the Supreme) as if there is any difference goes from death to death.   
The simple meaning of this is, what is experienced as "I", ie, (the Lord who is the inner self of the self   
which is his body), is the same as the innerself of all the other worlds. He undergoes no differences, increases or decreases on account of his sarvAntaryAmitvaM in diverse entities.   
manasaivedamAptavyaM neha nAnA.asti ki.nchana .mR^ityoH sa mR^ityuM gachChati ya iha nAneva pashyati (~KatOpanishad 4.11)   
Meaning: This is to be attained by the mind alone. There is no difference whatsoever here (in the paramAtmAn). From death to death goes he who sees here (in the paramAtmAn) as if there is any   
difference.   
This mantra says that the paramAtma is grasped bythe mind alone and reteirates that he is the same everywhere, despite being the innerself of diverse entities.   
Hence, these statements do not deny a difference between the Lord and his body. Their context itself indicates that. His body is made of suddha sattva, it is insentient, inseparably associated with him.   
PP: There are many scriptural statements as indicated above. Please take a look at the Brahmasutras in Parānandadhikaraṇa, Sthānaviseṣādhikaraṇa and ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa (which will be explained a bit later). All of them completely refute the Visiṣṭādvaita position in Anandasāmya. The Lord's niravayavatva is accepted by even Advaitins. There is no other way out.   
SD: Since the author has not elaborated on these adhikaraNas, it befits one to say that Vishishtadvaitins   
have also sufficiently commentated on those sections and safe to say, there is no contradiction. Indeed, if the few sutras which the author quoted to "prove" Bimba-Pratibimba vAda are any proof, it is clear that these statements of his do not carry much weight either. The "niravayatva" of Brahman is fully   
accepted by us as well.   
PP: The jiva can be amsa of the Lord just like the the spark of the fire. It only means jīva resembles the amsa, but in reality it is not amsa as it is impossible to be an amsa of "niravayava" Lord - Lord can not be split into parts. "Because jīva is controlled by Brahman, it is called as amsa, but in reality it is not an   
amśa".   
SD: The author quotes the argument of advaitins here. Very well. In Vishishtadvaita, “amsha-amshl” bhAva refers to the inseparability of the jIvAtma which is the body of paramAtma. This inseparability is one of the many outcomes of sharlrAtma bhAva (the others being dependency, seshatva, etc as seen earlier). Even if you say, the jIvA is called amSha because it is controlled by Brahman, any entity that is   
controlled by, dependent on, inseparable to and exists solely because of another entity is a sharlraM of that another entity. Not to mention the shAstra explicitly declares it to be so.   
Hence, there is no indication of vAyu jIvOttama in shAstra. Sections extolling prANa for the sake of upAsaNa or describing the state of the jIvAtma should be interpreted in the context of the purpose they serve to convey, ie, meditation in the former case and description of the jlva's helplessness and plea to   
the Lord in the latter case.   
PP: Vedavyāsa is indeed the full incarnation of Viṣṇu. Lord Krishna mentioned that in Gita - vedāntakṛdvedavideva caham Here vedanta   
vedanta is Brahmasutras. Lord is composer of Vedanta(Brahmasutras) and known thru vedas only. Lord Vedavyāsa composed Brahmasutras. He is mentioned as Avatāra of Viṣṇu in Bhāgavata also.   
SD: In that slOka, Lord is saying he is the compiler of the vedas in the same way he says "I am the creator and destroyer of the jagat". Just as the latter actions are accomplished by the Lord through Brahma and Rudra, the former is accomplished by the Lord through vyAsa. Of course, he is the actual doer, it doesn't   
mean the jiva who is veda vyAsa, brahma or rudra is verily him.   
Quoting the vishvaksEna Samhita of the pAncarAtra again:

As the Lord said to the attentive Vishvakesena;- "Those who have been entrusted with some cosmic   
authority should not be worshipped by those desirous of Liberation. I shall specifically mention those partial manifestations (pradurbhavan). .....The function of Buddha was to delude and Vyasa was appointed to compile the Vedas. Arjuna was the greatest of archers and Parasurama (Jamadagni) of   
powerful beings. .......They are merely entered into O Limitlessly glorious one! By my spirit on purpose and they are all unworthy of worship because they indeed partake of the nature of jivas and are   
possessed of egotism.   
Of the two types of AvEshAs, vyAsa is svarUpAvEsha where the Lord directly enters into a jIvA and acts through the jIvA. As vyAsa is a baddha jlva, bhagavAn exhibits his omniscience or knowledge of the veda   
through the svarUpAvEsha of vyAsa.   
As jIvAs in samsAra cannot be omniscient, the Lord entered the jlva known as veda vyAsa and exhibited the quality of omniscience to compile the vedas. So Lord can be worshipped, vyAsa can be worshipped as a guru, but vyAsa cannot be worshipped as the Lord.   
The above Agama statement can be easily reconciled with "vyAsAya vishNu rUpAya” – he has the svarUpAvEsha (vishNu rUpa, where “rUpa” can mean essential nature) in him.   
Bhagavan is indeed “pUrNaM” inside the jIvA vyAsa, but vyAsa is not the pUrNa bhagavAn. He is a jlva and hence it makes 100% sense to say that the Lord compiled the Vedas through vyAsa. Doesn't mean he is not to be respected though.   
PP: (panchabhEda) pratyakṣasiddha and Agamasiddha. No difference can be denied here. This has   
been discussed in detail inside this article.   
SD: Indeed. Some things are accepted, but others suggested by the tradition of the author have no   
pramANa.
