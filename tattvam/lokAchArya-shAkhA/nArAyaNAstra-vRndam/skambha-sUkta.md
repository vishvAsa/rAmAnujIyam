#### Skambha Sukta - A Sri Vaishnava Commentary (Part 1)

The four Vedas were divided by srI veda vyAsa on the following basis –   
  

- The Rg Veda describes the auspicious attributes of sriman nArAyaNa and identifies him alone as the Supreme Reality as vouched by the statements like “ekaM sat viprA bahudhA vadanti” and “yo devAnAm nAmadhA eka eva” Several sUktas glorify nArAyaNa by various names like Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Rudra, Soma, Vayu, etc. Only that god with all auspicious attributes is the Supreme – kasmai devAya haviShA vidhema reinforces it. This Veda represents the “akAra” of OM as it talks about the glories of viShNu (akAro viShNuvAcakaH, akAravAcyo vAsudevaH).
    

  

- The yajur veda highlights that the performance of duties must be done with the knowledge that sriman nArAyaNa is the enjoyer of all sacrifices and offerings. That is highlighted in the nArAyaNa sUkta which occurs in the yajnIki Upanishad – nArAyaNa is the param brahma, param tattvam, paro jyotiH and para AtmA. Everything is pervaded by him and as he has everything as his body, all offerings go to him.  So, he alone is to be propitiated. This veda is the “ukAra” of OM as the “ukAra” means that sriman nArAyaNa ONLY (and no other) is to be resorted to.
    

  

- The sAma veda takes these two in conjunction and identifies that the means to attain nArAyaNa is the Lord himself. Thus, upAsaNa is performed with the knowledge of the auspicious attributes of sriman nArAyaNa and by dedicating all activities to him with the knowledge that he is the sarvAntaryAmin. Thus the sAma veda is the Rg Veda set to music and also shows that the karmas prescribed in the yajur veda are ancillaries to “upAsana” which is the theme of the Veda and its most prominent Upanishad – the Chandogya. This Veda is the “makAra” of OM which signifies the jIva, as the purpose of upAsana is to identify via direct perception, the essential nature of the jivAtmA, which is sheShatvam (servitude to the Lord) and the jIva having nArAyaNa as its indweller.
    

  

- The atharvaNa veda thus, occupies the pride of place as the chaturthi vibhakti of OMkara. Once the above three are understood properly, the only thing left is to continuously reflect on tattva traya – the three realities of cit, acit and iSvara – until moksha is attained. Thus, this veda contains a mixture of themes elaborating on the nature of cit or the jivAtma, the nature of acit or prakrti (matter, the mind, sense organs, etc) and the nature of paramAtma as well. The atharvaNa veda reinforces the truths of the three Vedas.
    

  

Unfortunately, the atharva veda, out of the 4 vedas, has suffered the most at the hands of indologists, tantriks and other veda-bAhyas, who have misinterpreted it. Not understanding the highly metaphorical nature of this magnificent veda, they have called its themes as describing black magic, spells and all sorts of nonsense. So, let this write-up also show how lofty the themes contained in this veda are.

The skambha sUkta in the atharvaNa veda (10-7) is one such sUkta which elaborates the tattva traya and describes the artha pAnchakam – the nature of the jivA, the nature of paramAtma, the nature of the means to liberation, the nature of the  obstructions to liberation and the nature of the highest goal to be attained.

The following is a commentary on this sUkta faithful to its true meaning. This is a rebuttal to several vaiShNava-baiting shaiva groups who have misappropriated and misinterpreted this sUkta. The claim is that the term “skambha” refers to the shiva-linga based on the lingodbhava story occurring in the tAmasa purANas. The term “skambha” is misinterpreted as “pillar” and hence “shiva-linga”.

Indeed, thanks to useless indological interpretations floating around the internet, some clueless vishNu dveShis have completely misappropriated this sUkta. Therefore, we feel a clarifying commentary on this portion of the veda is warranted.

To that we reply as follows –

- The lingodbhava story is discounted since it occurs in the tAmasa purANas which contradict the veda. This has already been elaborated in the section on tAmasatva of purANas in this blog.
    

  

- The veda itself says – “nArAyaNAt brahmA jAyate, nArAyaNAt rudro jAyate, nArAyaNAt indro jAyate” and “eko ha vai nArAyaNa AsIt, na brahma, neShAnaH”. Rudra is declared as anapahatapApmA. Hence, there are innumerable proofs from shruti that the Lord nArAyaNa alone is praised by all sUktas and bears all names.
    

  

- Even the popular Shaiva-friendly commentator Sayana does not say that the sUkta praises shiva in the linga form. He simply says that the sUkta is an exposition on the mUla brahman, who is superior even to the four-faced brahmA.
    

  

- The term “skambha” does not imply a physical pillar. Neither does it mean “pillar”. The term means “support”. This meaning is apt to the descriptions of the sUkta which describe this Being as the support of various entities – prakrti, the jIvas, the supreme abode, the true devotees, the means to liberation and so on. The collection of all these is called “nAras”.
    

  

- The term “skambha” is etymologically connected with the “-ayana” sabdam in “nArAyaNa”. According to srI pillai lokAcArya, - “ayana” means the support or locus (Ashraya) for the nAras. Since the word ayana means support or locus (Ashraya), saying that \[He is\] their ayana \[he is\] their support or locus. If not interpreted as a tatpuruSha compound meaning “the support or locus for them,” it may be taken as a bahuvrihi, meaning “the one who has them as his support or locus.”
    

  

- We have the following pramANa in the shAstra (pAdmottara purANa 254.52) as quoted by srI pillai lOkAchAryA – “nAras are interpreted to be the collection of all persons. nArAyaNa is known by them as their way and support.”
    

  

- The sUkta talks about a collection of entities like gods, prakrti, the jIvas, the supreme abode, the devotees, auspicious attributes of bhagavAn, the means to attain him etc. These are collectively known as “nAras” according to the above pramAnA. “skambha” means “support” and is synonymous with the “-ayana” sabda.
    

  

- Therefore, the sUkta is a praise of sriman nArAyaNa only, who is known as “skambha” as he is the support of the nAras.
    

  

In fact, the entire sUkta can be summed up in a one liner – this sUkta is a commentary on the meaning of the name “nArAyaNa”. For, it describes the nAras in detail and also the Lord who is the support of these.

A point to note is that some mantras tend to repeat in the sUkta, wherein either the meaning (what was said earlier) is repeated again or the mantras itself repeat in a modified form. This should not be construed as a doSha or flaw of redundancy. When someone is meditating on Brahman, the ecstasy is such that by experiencing his guNas, he tends to repeat it. srI rAmAnuja often repeats certain auspicious attributes of bhagavAn in the gadyas due to his joy on experiencing the Lord. Yet another explanation is that the description of certain tattvas are repeated because they are to be reflected on constantly by the jivA – thus, repetition is not a doSha this way either.

With that knowledge and by the grace of pUrvAchAryAs, let us begin the study of this sUkta.

  
  

SKAMBHA SUKTA – A SRI VAISHNAVA COMMENTARY

kásminn áṅge tápo asyā́dhi tiṣṭhati kásminn áṅga r̥tám asyā́dhy ā́hitam

kvà vratáṃ kvà śraddhā́sya tiṣṭhati kásminn áṅge satyám asya prátiṣṭhitam 1

Meaning: In what part does the tapas or penance which is the concentration of the mind abide? In which part does Rtam or the individual self that has no modification in its essential naturereside? Where is karma or performance of duties (vratam) and conviction (sraddha) established? In what part is truth (that leads to archirAdi) established?

“tapas” is the concentration of the mind.

“Rtam” means that which is not subject to modification in its essential nature, ie, the jivAtma.

“Sraddha” is conviction that paramAtma alone is the supreme goal.

“satyam” refers to truth which is part of upAsana along with “vrata”, which is the performance of duties. The duties include good deeds such as building temples, tanks, etc as laid down by the smritis and also rituals for various gods like Indra, Agni, Surya, etc (with the knowledge that paramAtmA is the inner self of all).

Truth refers to speaking words for the good of others according to srI ranga rAmAnuja muni – bhUta hita vachanam. This is an accessory of upAsana that leads to the devAyana and is part of the means to liberation.

What is the support of all these? The question posed by this mantra is answered in the mahAnArAyaNOpanishad, 6th mantra which says Brahman is bhuvanasya nAbhi, or the hub of the Universe as he is the ground.

In other words,it is the Supreme Brahman, without which nothing exists and to him are tapas, shraddhA, vratam and satyam directed towards, performed by the jivA who is Rtam. In Gita 9.24, bhagavAn refers to himself as “prabhureva” which means – as He is the ground of the universe, He is the dispenser of all fruits. This is more clearly brought out in the next mantra.

kásmād áṅgād dīpyate agnír asya kásmād áṅgāt pavate mātaríśva

kásmād áṅgād ví mimīté 'dhi candrámā mahá skambhásya mímāno áṅgam 2

Meaning: From which part does agni shine forth? From which part does air proceed? From which part does the cool light of the moon (chandramA) traverse (ie, illuminate the earth)? Of (which) part of Skambha, the support of all, the waters sound?

“skambha” – The Support of the Universe.

The name “skambha” means the support of all. He is the support of the Universe, the ground of all being, the very existence of all. And hence, the bestower of all fruits. As mentioned in the Gita 9.24, bhagavAn is “prabhurEva” by virtue of being the ground of all and hence the dispenser of the fruits of all karmas as sarvAntaryAmin.

That bhagavAn is the support of the Universe is mapped to the following sahasranAma nAmas – “vyavasAyaH vyavasthAnaH samsthAnaH sthAnadaH dhruva:”.

As proven in the introduction earlier, it is only sriman nArAyaNa who is referred to as “skambha”.

The reference to angas is to elaborate that everything functions according to his will like the limbs of a body. This establishes complete dependence. The BrihadAraNyaka says "aN^gAnyanyA devata:"

Note that "anga" does not occur for "kva vratam kva sraddha" - this is because these are dependent primarily on the jivA and secondarily on paramAtma (his will is needed for the jivAtma to execute its will, on which are dependent the performance of duties and conviction). Since the degree of performance of duties and conviction varies and is not always in tune with paramAtma's will (though he allows it), the "angam" is not mentioned there.

This does not mean it is not dependent on his will, rather that the dependence is absolute but indirect. By his will, he allows jivAs to execute their will.

In contrast, satyam, tapas, the jivAs and the deities - agni, matarisva, waters, moon, etc are his angams as they are directly subservient to him or controlled by him.

kásminn áṅge tiṣṭhati bhū́mir asya kásminn áṅge tiṣṭhaty antárikṣam

kásminn áṅge tiṣṭhaty ā́hitā dyáuḥ kásminn áṅge tiṣṭhaty úttaraṃ diváḥ 3

Meaning: In what part does earth abide? In which part does antarIksha or the intermediary region abide? In what part does dyuloka or the celestial region abide? In what part does the highest world, ie, srI vaikunta known as uttara diva abide?

“uttaram divaH” – refers to paramam padam.

kvà prépsan dīpyata ūrdhvó agníḥ kvà prépsan pavate mātaríśvā

yátra prépsantīr abhiyánty āvŕ̥taḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 4

Meaning: What is the (goal) of the shining (path) that leads the desirous (mummukshus) upward? Where does the transmigrating jivA (mAtarisvA) desirous (of mOksha) go? Who indeed, tell me, is the One who covers the three worlds, that which is the support of the worlds, (who) alone (is) the best or the foremost (because he protects the worlds by enveloping them), unto whom the desirous (the devotees) go towards, ie, whose thoughts are always directed towards?

“dIpyata UrdhvO agniH” – The shining path of archirAdi. “Agni” refers to that which leads upwards (UrdhvaH) to moksha. The desirous here refer to mummukshus. Or, it could be the path lead by Agni as the deities of the light beginning with Agni. Meaning is the same.

“mAtarishvA” – The isavasya upanishad refers to the transmigrating jivA as vAyu. Since the jivAs move like wind ceaselessly in samsAra, they are called “mAtarisvA” here. Since the archirAdi path is traversed by those mummukshus who are transmigrating in samsAra, it is relevant to mention transmigration here.

“AvRttaH” –Bhattar quotes taittiriya Upanishad 1.1 for the nAma “varuNa” in the sahasranAma -  yena AvRtam kham ca divam mahIm ca \- He by Whom are covered the Ether, the Svarga, and the Earth" – so, “AvRttaH” means he who envelopes the three worlds as well.

"skambam" and "katamah" are repeated in the subsequent mantras. Each time they have a different meaning based on context. Here, he is the support of the worlds and hence, the foremost protector.

The desirous, ie, devotees, go towards him, meaning, their thoughts are always directed towards him.

And finally, the nature of the enquiry is set. “Tell me, O Acharya, about that Brahman which is the support of the worlds, by virtue of which he envelopes and protects the three worlds, and who is the best or the foremost protector of all because of this?”

Yatra – who, prepsantIr – desirous, abhiyanti – go towards/up, AvRtah – filled with/concealing, skambham – the support, tam – unto him, brUhi – tell me, katamaH – the best/out of many, svid – indeed, eva – only, saH –that which

kvā̀rdhamāsā́ḥ kvà yanti mā́sāḥ saṃvatsaréṇa sahá saṃvidānā́ḥ

yátra yánty r̥távo yátrārtavā́ḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 5

Meaning: Where do the (jivAs) associated with (bright) halves of months, the year constituted by the months go? Who indeed, tell me, is that which is the support of the means (or the paths)  to attain the goal, (who) alone (is) the best or the foremost (because of being the means), to whom (the jivAs associated) with time and periods of time go to?

“ArdhamAsaH”, “mAsAh samvatsarEna saha” – the presiding deity of the bright half of the months, the presiding deity of the year constituted by the months. This refers to the adi-vahikAs of the archirAdi gathi as seen in the panchAgni vidya prakaraNam of the chAndOgya Upanishad and gita.

“samvidAnaH” – should be taken as the jivAs associated with these half-months, months and year. Because of very close association, the jivA himself is termed “months”, “year” etc. In the panchAgni vidyA, similar usage is seen when it is said that the transmigrating jivA “becomes” cloud, “becomes” rain, etc. In reality, the jivA is in close association with these elements and hence designated as these elements, but does not literally become these.

“rtavO”, “ArtavaH” – The jivAs on the path of liberation associated with time and divisions of time. The kaushItaki upanishad says that the jivAs, upon reaching paramam padam, have a dialogue with paramAtma and say the following:

“So strive, O divisions of time, to make me immortal, by that truth, by that austerity, I am time. I am of time.” ~ Kaushitaki Upanishad.

This is a recognition of time as an accessory for upAsaNa.

Note that each time, “skambam” and “katamah”, meaning the best or foremost and support respectively, is interpreted based on context. In the previous mantra, he is the support of the worlds, and hence, the foremost protector. Here, he is the support of the paths which are the means to attain the goal and hence, the foremost means to attain the goal. This is in the context is of archirAdi gathi, which is supported by him.

kvà prépsantī yuvatī́ vírūpe ahorātré dravataḥ saṃvidāné

yátra prépsantīr abhiyánty ā́paḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 6

Meaning: What is (the nature of that Brahman) associated day and night with the two young devIs of different natures (ie, hrI and srI), in agreement, seek with speed (Arti)? Who indeed, tell me, is the One who is obtained (after such mediation), that which is the support of the senses, unto whom the desirous waters (the mind and the senses) go towards, ie, whose thoughts are always directed towards?

“yuvatI virUpE ahorAtrE” – The puruSha sUkta says “hrIsca tE lakShmisca patnyou; ahOrAtrE pArShvE”.  This is interpreted by the AchAryAs as “He is associated day and night (ie, always) with bhU devi and Lakshmi devi”.  He is always associated with these eternally young consorts as indicated by “ahOrAtrE”. Although this describes mOksha sthAna in the present context, it is applicable in general everywhere.

These devIs are of different natures (virUpE). While srI dEvi is the epitome of all prosperity,  bhU dEvi (hri) is the epitome of modesty.

AchAryAs also say that the two dEvIs mediate for the jivAs as follows – SrI devi asks bhagavAn – “what jivA has not committed sin? Hence, forgive the jivAs”. But bhU dEvI goes one step further and asks bhagavAn – “In reality, these jivAs have never committed sins”. This shows the difference in their approaches and hence, “virUpE” is justified here as well.

“dravataH samvidAnE” - However, despite being different in natures, these two devis are in perfect harmony with respect to their goal – which is to mediate on behalf of the jIvAs and ensure bhagavAn’s grace is secured for them. They do this very speedily, meaning, they are easily able to persuade him and also act quickly in compassion for the jIvAs.

“ApaH” – “waters”, refers to the senses. Those who know this tattva seek bhagavAn with their mind and senses, denoted by “waters” which refer to the subtle elements constituting these organs. Thus, he is Skambha as he is the support of the mind and senses.

“skambam”, “katamaH” – As he is attained by those with intense longing, he is the support of these devotees and hence, the foremost goal of attainment for them.

yásmint stabdhvā́ prajā́patir lokā́nt sárvām̐ ádhārayat

skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 7

Meaning: Tell me about that (Brahman) which is the support of (Brahma), the best or foremost of gods (as he is superior to Brahma), on which Prajapati (who) established all the worlds, is firmly fixed (in meditation)?

Note that the nature of inquiry here has nothing to do with any ambiguity over which deity is Brahman. By asking “who/what/which” all the time, the sUkta is only enquiring about the nature of Brahman. What indeed is his essential nature that makes him the support of all? Because we can clearly see from the queries, the knowledge of Brahman being the support of all is already there.

Stabdhva – firmly fixed in meditation or one who firmly abides by the directions of sriman nArAyaNa. This is an adjective of Brahma.

This mantra has an upabrahmaNa in the mahAbhArata as well:

yuga-kOTi-sahasrANi vishNum-ArAdhya padma-bhU: |

punas-trailOkya-dhAtRtvam prAptavAn-iti SuSRuma ||  ~ mahAbhArata, kuNTataropAkhyAnam

Meaning: Worshipping VishNu for one thousand million yuga-s, the lotus born catur-mukha-brahmA attained the ability to create the three Worlds.

The svetAsvatArOpanishad refers to Brahma as “devAnAm prathamaH” indicating that Brahma is superior to all gods (for the benefit of viShNu-dveShIs reading this, this includes Shiva as well since Brahma is his father and teacher). Brahman is thus, the support of Brahma (skambam) and the foremost of gods as he is older than even Brahma (katamam).

yát paramám avamám yác ca madhyamáṃ prajā́patiḥ sasr̥jé viśvárūpam

kíyatā skambháḥ prá viveśa tátra yán ná prā́viśat kíyat tád babhūva 8

Meaning: Of that Universe characterised by higher, lower and middle (worlds) that prajApati (Brahma) brought forth, how much of he who is the support of the jivAs (skambhaH) entered (having jivAs as his body) and of that (skambhaH), how much remained without entry  (ie, remained in paramapada)?

“kiyatA skambhaH praviveSa”  - After the creation of the Universe, Brahma guided by his antaryAmin, created the classes of gods, men, etc. And hence, individual selves were allotted bodies and became gross forms in the Universe. Since the jivAs are the body of Brahman (yasya Atma sarIram), all names which designate the jivAs denote Brahman owing to inseparability. Since paramAtma is all-pervading and has no need to “enter” the Universe, the reference to entry is only to the entry of the jivAs who have paramAtma as their antaryAmin. In other words, sriman nArAyaNa, with the gross forms of the jivAs as his body, entered the Universe.

It is in this sense he is called “skambhaH” here – the support of the jivAs. The jivAs acquired gross forms and entered the Universe. So, it is said that paramAtma, who has the jivAs as his body, entered the Universe. This is the crux of sAmAnAdhikaraNyam and sharIrAtma bhAva. The pramAna – “anEna jivAtmanA anupravishya nAmarUpE vyAkaravANi” establishes this.

The taittiryOpanishad reiterates the same thing – “Having created that, that brahman (having the jivAs as its body) entered into that itself”. The mahAnArAyaNOpanishad also contains the following – “He entered into all such created entities, moving and non-moving, such as herbs, plants and animals and puruShas, (as their innerself) is Brahman”.

For the next line, which asks how much of skambha entered and how much remained without such entry,this must be understood in the context of the puruSha sUkta which says - pAdo 'sya vishvA bhUtAni tripAdasyAmRtam divi.  One part of that puruSha sustains the universe and three parts are in paramapada.

One part refers to the paramAtma who is the form of the jivAs in samsAra (as sarvAntaryAmin) who are born again and again. The remaining three parts are the three forms that are hidden– namely, the object of experience (bhOgyasthAna), the place of experience (bhOgasthAna) and the instruments of experience of paramAtma (bhOgOpakaraNasthAna). These refer to paramapada, hence they are hidden.

kíyatā skambháḥ prá viveśa bhūtám kíyad bhaviṣyád anvā́śaye 'sya

ékaṃ yád áṅgam ákr̥ṇot sahasradhā́ kíyatā skambháḥ prá viveśa tátra 9

Meaning: Of what qualities or nature is that supporter of the jivAs, who has entered the (jivAs) existing (ie, presently being born)? Of what qualities or nature is this (Brahman) who exists near, ie, has as his body, (those jivAs who will be born in) the future? Of what nature is that supporter of the Universe, who has entered that part of his (prakrti) which he made thousand-fold, ie, variegated?

As explained earlier, “entering” only refers to Brahman being the innerself of the jivA who moves about in samsAra. The mahAnArAyaNa Upanishad says that Brahman is the innerself of the jivAs who were born before, who are being born presently and who will be born in the future. “bhUtam” refers to jivAs being embodied, or born in the present, while “bhavisyad” refers to jivAs that will be born in the future.

As mentioned earlier, one part of that Brahman is the Universe or the jivAs migrating in samsAra, who constitute his body. So “ekam yad angam” refers to prakrti here.

SvetasvatAra Upanishad calls prakrti as that “one unborn, which is creating manyfold creatures similar to itself”. What it means is, prakrti which is of the nature of sattva, rajas, tamas – is the producer of varied entities (objects of enjoyment and the jivAs associated with bodies) that are similar to it in nature, ie, they have varying proportions of the triguNas.

The same thought is expressed here by saying that one part becomes infinitely many. “sahasradhA” must not merely be taken as a thousand, but of infinite/many-fold forms.

“kiyatA” must not be taken as “to what extent” or “how much” as it makes no sense to ask how much he has entered into the present and future beings. In this context, it refers to an inquiry on the essential nature and qualities of Brahman.

yátra lokā́mś ca kóśāṃś cā́po bráhma jánā vidúḥ

ásac ca yátra sác cāntá skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 10

Meaning: Who indeed, tell me, is that supporter of the sentients and insentients, the foremost or superior to the sentients and insentients, the source or cause or limit (as the innerself) of the sentients and insentients, that men know (meditate as) in whom (is supported) the worlds, the coverings of the Universe, “water” signifying the subtle elements and unmanifested prakrti (consisting of the collection of sentients and insentients)?

“asat” refers to prakrti which is changing constantly in its svarUpa and svabhAva. “sat” refers to the jivAs who do not undergo any changes in their essential nature.

“skambhah”, “katamah” – he is the supporter of sat (jivAs) and asat (prakrti) and hence the foremost or superior to both.

“anta” – used in the sense to denote that he is the source, cause, end or limit of the jivAs and prakrti, ie, he is their innerself.

“ApaH” – This does not merely indicate “water” only according to srI ranga rAmAnuja muni but also indicates the other subtle elements including water, which make up the universe.

“brahma” – The unmanifested prakrti which is the collection of  sentients and insentients is known as brahma according to the Gita 14.3 ~ “This Brahman is my womb”. The mundakOpanishad 1.1.9 also says – “Of him is born (this food) of the form of Brahma and through that, food having name and form”. srI rAmAnuja as well as Upanishad bhAshyakArar say that the Upanishad uses “brahma” to denote the unmanifested prakrti which is the collectivity of sentients and insentients.

janA vidhuh – “janA” refers to all classes of men, gods, etc (and not merely humans). “viduh” refers to the fact that they meditate on Brahman in this manner as the support of everything. The word “viduh” does not indicate mere knowing or vAkyartha jnAna, but denotes meditation or jnAna visEsaNa upAsaNa.

Yatra – in which, lokams – the worlds, kosams – the enclosures of the Universe, apa – water signifying the subtle elements, brahma – prakrti which is great, janA – men, viduh – know, asat – the insentient, yatra – in which, sat – sentient, anta – the source, skambham – supporter of the sentients and insentients, katamah – the best or foremost as he is superior to the sentients and insentients

yátra tápaḥ parākrámya vratáṃ dhāráyaty úttaram

r̥táṃ ca yátra śraddhā́ cā́po bráhma samā́hitāḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 11

Meaning: Say indeed, that supporter of auspicious attributes (Skambah) and the foremost as he possesses all attributes (katamah), is he in whom (exists) tapas, ie, the quality of having the knowledge to guide the chEtanas out of samsAra, having excelled , ie, surpassed all obstacles, (parAkrama), bears or sustains (dhArayati) the vow (vratam) which rescues (uttaram), ie, the vow to protect and hence rescue those who surrender and in whom is fixed the jivAtma whose essential nature undergoes no modifications (Rtam), conviction (sraddha) and prakrti characterised by the subtle elements signified by “waters” (ApO brahma).

Now, the sUkta gives a definition of Brahman by describing his auspicious attributes.

“tapaH” – yasya jnAnamaya tapaH – the name occurs as “mahA tapaH” in sahasranAma and also in mundakOpanishad. This signifies that he has the knowledge to lead samsArIs to moksha – namely, he knows their distress as well as their desires.

“parAkrama” – Owing to the knowledge denoted by “tapas”, he excels or surpasses all obstacles to the fulfilment of that knowledge and uplifts all jIvAs.

“Vrata” – this name occurs in the sahasranAma as “su-vrataH” and refers to his vow of protecting those surrendered to him. As srI rAma says – “sakRdeva prapannAya tavAsmIti ca yAcatE. Abhayam sarva-bhUtEbhyo dadamyetat vratam mama” – “This is my vow, that to him who seeks protection from me just once and says ‘I am Yours’, I give him protection from all beings”.

“uttaram dhArayati” – This name also occurs in the sahasranAma (uttarO gOpatir gOpta). Uttaram – uttaraNAt uttarah. He is the rescuer of the devas from the asurAs by virtue of the previous qualities and hence, supports the devas. The vow of saranAgati is “uttaraM” as it rescues the jIvAs, and he bears or sustains that vow.

Having described his attributes that arise due to his nature, the next line begins again with “rtam ca yatra” to show a new set of attributes he possesses by virtue of association. These include those which he has as his body – “yasya prithvi sarIram”, “yasya Atma sarIram”.

“rtam” refers to the individual self and “ApO brahma” refers to prakrti with subtle elements as explained in previous mantras where these terms occurred. They are his body.

“sraddha” refers to conviction that paramAtma is the supreme goal. Since bhagavAn himself is the means to the end (amRtasya sEtu:), he has sraddha as his body or he himself is the means which is the conviction, to attain the end.

“skambhah”, “katamaH” – since attributes by nature and by association are described, these terms here denote that he bears all attributes and hence is superior to all by virtue of that.

yásmin bhū́mir antárikṣaṃ dyáur yásminn ádhy ā́hitā

yátrāgníś candrámāḥ sū́ryo vā́tas tiṣṭhanty ā́rpitāḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 12

Meaning: Say indeed, that supporter of existence (Skambah) and the foremost of all that exists (katamah), is he in whom (is established) the earth, the intermediary region and the celestial regions, which rest (on him for their existence), in whom Agni, Chandra, Sun and Wind abide as dependents.

The previous line talks of insentient entities, namely, the earth, intermediary and celestial regions. Hence, the usage “YasminadhyAhitA” later shows that they rest on him for existence, ie, without Brahman, they wouldn’t exist. That much is the nature of the insentients. Since they lack sentiency, they do not have seshatvam, but their existence is due to him.

But the next line talks about sentient entities like Agni, Surya, etc and hence the words “tisthantyArpitaH” means – they abide as dependent on him, ie, they are sentient beings who are subject to him (seshatva) by their essential nature.

“skambhah”, “katamah” – As this mantra talks about the essential nature of insentient entities (dependence) and sentient entities (seshatvam), he is the supporter of existence and hence foremost of all that exists.

yásya tráyastriṃśad devā́ áṅge sárve samā́hitāḥ

skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 13

Meaning: Say indeed, that supporter of the three and thirty gods (Skambah) and the One superior to all these gods (katamah), is he on whose limbs are fixed all three and thirty gods, ie, they are his vibhUtIs.

The three and thirty gods are the eight vasus, eleven rudras, twelve adityas, Indra and Prajapati. YajnavAlkya says in the brihadAraNyaka Upanishad that though there are 3306 gods, all of them are either the powers or manifestations of these thirty three gods, and hence, there are thirty three.

The Upanishad goes on to say that all these gods are vibhUtIs of Brahman as srI ranga rAmAnuja muni explains – tatasca brahmaNo mahimAn: sarvE deva: iti paryavastita: artha:

yátra ŕ̥ṣayaḥ prathamajā́ ŕ̥caḥ sā́ma yájur mahī́

ekarṣír yásminn ā́rpitaḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 14

Meaning: Say indeed, that supporter of the rSis (Skambah) and the foremost of all the rSis (katamah), is he wherein (abide) the rSis born prior to all  (sapta rSis), the rk, sAma and yajur veda, the cow (speech of the form of the three vedas), on whom  the foremost rSi kapila (expounder of sAnkhya) is dependent (for knowledge).

“skambhah”, “katamah” – bhagavAn himself is called a maharSi by the svEtAsvatAra 3.4 as he is infinitely omniscient. Hence, he is the foremost of rSis as well.

BhagavAn says in Gita 10.7 that the sapta-rSis –marIci, atri, Angiras, pulastya, pulaha, kratu and vaSista were born of him (through the agency of Brahma).

“mahI” means cow and refers to speech which is of the form of the 3 vedas – rk, yajus and sAman. brihadAraNyaka Upanishad 5.8.1 enjoins meditation of speech which is of the form of the 3 vedas as a cow. The 4 udders of speech are svaha, vashat, hanta and svadha. SvahakAra and vashatkAra are used for deva yajnA while “hanta” is the term  used in manuShya yajna when food is given to humans. “svadha” is offered to the pitrs.

“ekarsir” – ekaH means chief. Kapila is the chief or foremost of the rSis. Under vishNu sahasranAma bhAshya for “maharSih kapilAchArya”, Bhattar explains that kapila is celebrated for expounding the sankhya system - sAnkhyasya vaktA kapilah paramrshih sa ucyate and Bhattar also quotes svEtAsvatAra 5.2 which says rSim prasUtam kapilam mahAntam– “He who endowed the rSi kapila who was born prior to creation with knowledge and cast his kind glances on kapila even before he was born.

“arpitaH” – this indicates that kapila muni is a vibhUti and a shaktyAvEsa avatAra of bhagavAn, hence dependent on bhagavAn. In the Gita, krishNa also says siddhAnAm kapilO muniH, which is quoted by Bhattar as well.

yátrāmŕ̥taṃ ca mr̥tyúś ca púruṣé 'dhi samā́hite

samudró yásya nāḍyàḥ púruṣé 'dhi samā́hitāḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 15

Meaning:  In which puruSha (jIvAtma), who is firmly established (in paramAtma), abide srI vaikunta (amRta) and samsara mandala (mrtyu), whose nADis or veins, well-established in the puruSha (paramAtma), is (associated with) the aggregate of puNya and pApa karmas designated as “samudrA”, Say indeed, that is (in terms of inseparability), the supporter of puruSha and prakrti (skambah) and the One who is superior to both (katamah)

The first “puruSha” denotes the jIvAtma. The existence of the jIvAtma is dependent on paramAtma and hence he is established in the latter. The existence of srI vaikunta (amRta) and samsara mandala (the place of deaths, mrtyu) depend on the existence of the jIvAtma and are said to abide in the latter.

The nADis of the jIvAtma refer to several veins of different colors in the body associated with the jIvAtma. At the time of death, the jIvAtma passes out of one of these veins, to lower or upper worlds, with the suShumna nADi leading to moksha. Since this is dependent on the puNya and pApa karmas, the rk states that these nADis are (ie, closely associated with) the karmas.

“samudrA” denotes any great collection or aggregate and hence refers to the groups of puNya and pApa karmas here. srI ranga rAmAnuja muni states that samudra is a term signifying a great volume of water and hence, signifies the group of elements -  samudrasabdEna jalarAshivAcinA bhUtavarga upalakShyatE, but in general can be applied to any large collection of things.

“skambhaH”, “katamaH” – Since both srI vaikunta designated as “amRta” and samsAra mandalam designated as “mRtyu” (as it is the place of deaths) can be grouped as “prakrti”. The first “puruSha” denotes the individual self. Hence, these terms “skambhah” and “katamaH” denote he is the supporter of and superior to prakrti and puruSa.

Due to aprthak-siddham or inseparability between jivAtma and paramAtma, the jIvAtma is called as Skambha.

yásya cátasraḥ pradíśo nāḍyàs tíṣṭhanti prathamā́ḥ

yajñó yátra párākrāntaḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 16

Meaning: Say indeed, that supporter of the quarters (skambah) and the foremost Lord of All, ie, sarvEshwara, who rules over the quarters (katamah) is he in whom, (as the form of) the chiefs (the presiding deities – aniruddha, pradyumna, sankarshana and vAsudEva),are established the 4 quarters (vaisvAnara, taijasa, prajna and turIya), in whom, sacrifice, ie, the means (ie, actions of the jivA which experiences in the 4 states) is strong (of the form of knowledge or sentient).

“catasraH pradIsho” refers to the 4 quarters of the mANDUkya – vishva, taijasa, prajna and turIya.

“prathamAH” – refer to the chiefs or the presiding deities of these 4 states – aniruddha, pradyumna, sankarshana and vAsudEva. He supports the 4 quarters in the form of the 4 vyUhas.

“skambha” – He supports the 4 quarters in the form of the vyUhas.

“katamaH” – The mAndUkya says that the suShupti sthAna is the lord of all, the sarvEshwara – eSha sarvEshwara: eSha sarvajna:.

“yajna” – refers to bhagavAn being the means for the jivAs to experience the waking, dream, deep sleep and the state of tUrIya which is different from the other 3 states and represents para-vAsudEva mUrti.

“parAkrAntaH” – strength, which is a metaphor for knowledge. In other words, the means (yajna) is bhagavAn who is sentient or knowledge-self and hence, can fulfil the desires of the chEtanas.

“vaisvAnara” means “one who leads the beings of this world” – so aniruddha is the means for the jivAs to experience the objects of enjoyment in the waking state. “taijasa” refers to dream state as very subtle objects of the dream that are not known by others, shine out like tejas – pradyumna is the means for the jivAs to experience the dream objects. “prajnA” is the state of oneness in dreamless sleep – sankarshana is the means to experience the bliss of this state. tUriya is the experience of mokSa sthAna and para-vAsudeva is the means of this experience.

Thus, he is the sentient means in all cases for the jivAs to experience the objects of enjoyment. This is as opposed to means such as japa, yajna, etc which are insentient.

yé púruṣe bráhma vidús té viduḥ parameṣṭhínam

yó véda parameṣṭhínaṃ yáś ca véda prajā́patim

jyeṣṭháṃ yé brā́hmaṇaṃ vidús te skambhám anusáṃviduḥ 17

Meaning: The wise know the puruSa (vAsudEva), in whom is Brahma ie, having Brahma as his body and his dependent, to be parameshti, ie, the Supreme Reality that resides in srI vaikunta. That which is known as the supreme reality (paramesthinam), who is also known as the lord of all beings (prajApatim) including the lotus-born brahma, known as older than the oldest as he is older than even the self-born Brahma (jyEstha), who is the instructor of the vedas (to brahma), they know (meditate) thus as the supporter of all beings (skambhah).

“puruSa” – Ancient vedAntins automatically held puruSa to be synonymous to “vAsudeva”.

“paramESThinam”  - the name occurs in the sahasranAma and Bhattar interprets it as  “parame sthAne tishThati iti paramESThI” – he who resides in the supreme abode.

The wise seers know that puruSa, vAsudEva, who is the inner self of Brahma, as paramESThin. “Brahma is in puruSa” means that Brahma is dependent on vAsudevA or he is meditating on vAsudeva, who is the inner self of Brahma and has Brahma as his body. The mahAnArAyaNa Upanishad echoes the same thought by saying “eSha aditya puruSa saH paramESThi brahmAtma” (that puruSa in Aditya is paramESThi and the innerself of Brahma).

The names “prajApatiH” and ”jyEshta” are the names of paramAtma and occur in the vishNu sahasranAma. “jyEshta” means he is older than even Brahma who is regarded as the oldest. “prajApatiH” means he is the lord of all beings.

“brAhmaNaH” – the name also occurs in the sahasranAma and means he is the instructor of the vedas to brahma. The svetAsvatAra also reiterates this as “yo brahmaNam vidhAti purvam…..saranam aham prapadyE.

“tE skambham anusamviduh” – they, the wise acharyas, therefore as a consequence of such understanding, meditate on this puruSa, vAsudEva, as the support of all beings (skambhah).

How do they meditate on him? The following rks answer that.

yásya śíro vaiśvānaráś cákṣur áṅgirasó 'bhavan

áṅgāni yásya yātávaḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 18

Meaning: Say that he is the support of meditation (skambhah) and who is the foremost as he is the supreme object of meditation (katamah), of whom the head became the digestive fire indicative of the quality of rulership (vaisvAnara), the eye became the prAna indicative of the quality of sustaining (Angirasa) and the limbs became the sense organs indicative of reaching out  or travellers (yAtava).

“skambhah”, “katamaH” – the support of meditation and the supreme object of meditation. This is as per “nArAyaNa parO dhyAta: dhyAnam nArAyaNa para:”

“vaiSvAnara” – this refers to the digestive fire. BhagavAn says “ahaM vaisvAnarO brutva” – I become the digestive fire. “vaisvAnara” refers to being the ruler of all and hence one must have such a view of Brahman in jatarAgni,  meditated as the head.

“Angiras” is mukhyaprAna, which is the essence of all parts (angarasa) according to the Upanishad. and is meditated as the eye. The eye is known as the sustainer (cakSurvAva pratiStita) since it shows the even and uneven surface of the earth and helps in being stationed firmly. Similarly, mukhyaprAna is celebrated as the sustainer of the body, without which other organs cannot function.Thus, his eye is to be meditated as the sustainer of life in the form of prAna.

“yAtava” means  “travellers” –  the sense organs like eye, ear, etc which travel or reach out to the external world and hence allow the action of seeing, hearing, etc. Understandably, these are meditated as the limbs as they form the basis for sAdhana.

yásya bráhma múkham āhúr jihvā́ṃ madhukaśā́m utá

virā́jam ū́dho yásyāhúḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 19

Meaning: Say that he is the support of sacrifice (skambhah) and who is the foremost as he is the supreme object of sacrifice (katamah), of whom the mouth is dharma or injunctions prescribed in the sAstra, the tongue is said to be the quality of honey (experience of the fruits), of whom the udder or base is that (paramAtma) having the form of prakrti (virAT).

“brahma” is interpreted as dharma by Bhattar in the sahasranAma on account of the usage “tapObrahma”. Here, dharma refers to the rites of the form of jyOtishtOma and other sacrifices to be performed. Since bhagavAn is the enjoyer of all sacrifices, dharma is to be meditated as the mouth.

“madhukASha”  - the quality of honey, or the fruits of the sacrifice such as svarga, etc which are enjoyed by the jivA.

“virAjam UdhO” – Udder refers to the base of the tongue, metaphorically meaning the base of such sacrifices and phalans which is Brahman himself. He is the recipient of all offerings and provider of all the fruits of sacrifices and hence is the base. The reason being, he has prakrti, denoted by “virAja” as his body, and is the inner controller.

“skambhah”, “katamah” – Since this mantra talks about sacrifice, it is relevant to take these terms as related to sacrifice. It is also likely not wrong to take it as the same meaning of the previous mantra, as this is also a continuation of the form described for meditation.

yásmād ŕ̥co apā́takṣan yájur yásmād apā́kaṣan

sā́māni yásya lómāny atharvāṅgiráso múkhaṃ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 20

Meaning: Say that he is the support of the vedas (skambhah) and who is the foremost as he is the supreme object to be attained by the veda (katamah), from whom the riks were formed (arose) by breathing, by whom the yajur mantras were split (into shukla and krishna), whose hairs are the sAmans, whose face (mind) is the atharvAngiras.

“ rco apAtakSan” – apana-takSati – the rks arose from the breath of Brahman.

“yajur yasmAd apAkasan” – the yajus was split into krishna and shukla.

“sAmAni lomAni” – the sAmans are resting on rk and hence are described as hairs.

“mukham” – refers to the mind, to which the atharvAngira is compared.

“skambhah”, “katamah” – As the context is the vedic mantras, he is described as the support of the vedas and the supreme object of the vedas.

asaccākhā́ṃ pratíṣṭhantīṃ paramám iva jánā viduḥ

utó sán manyanté 'vare yé te śā́k+hām upā́sate 21

Meaning: The wise men (janA) know (viduH) the individual self, which called “paramam” as it is superior to prakrti, as indeed the foundation of the divisions of insentients (gross forms), and those who (yE) are inferior (avarE), consider (manyatE) it (prakrti) as the individual self (sat), they meditate on the divisions.

In the previous mantras, meditation on paramAtma’s various parts as related to vaisvAnara, prAna, organs of action, yajna and veda was enjoined. This was related to practice of karma yOga, which involves performance of nitya naimittika karmas to gain an understanding of the essential nature of the jivA.  The idea is by equating all those to his parts, the jivA is instructed to understand all activities as dependent on Brahman.

Here in this mantra, the next step of realisation, namely, jnAna yOga is outlined.

It is the individual self referred to as “paramam” here as it is superior to acit or prakrti. In Gita 8.20-21, bhagavAn explains thatthe jivAtma is called by terms like “paraH” and “paramAm gatim” as it is a superior goal of human endeavour as compared to prakrti.

The Upanishads refer to the individual self as “prAna” as it is the supporter of all movable and immovable bodies, which comprise the divisions of insentients. This samsAra mandalam exists on account of the jivAs and hence, the jivAs, collectively referred to in the singular because of their identical natures, constitute the foundation of insentients.

Therefore, the wise, who undertake jnAna yOga, meditate on the individual self, as the supporter of all gross forms. They do not see differences and consider all equal as they only perceive the individual selves with identical natures in different gross forms.

In contrast, those who are inferior in terms of knowledge, mistakenly identify the gross forms as the individual selves (dehAtma brahmam) and reflect on the differences in gross forms.

“janA” – the class of men, gods, etc eligible to meditate on Brahman.

“viduH” – they should know the individual self thus. There should be no scope for doubt.

yátrādityā́ś ca rudrā́ś ca vásavaś ca samā́hítāḥ

bhūtáṃ ca yátra bhávyaṃ ca sárve lokā́ḥ prátiṣṭhitāḥ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 22

Meaning: Say that the support of the vibhUtIs (skambhah) and who is the foremost as everything is his vibhUti (katamah) is he in whom the AdiytAs, Rudras and Vasus are fixed (ie, who are his vibhUtIs), in whom that which was and that which will be (as well as that which is) and all the worlds (leela and nitya vibhUti) are established, ie, he is their innerself.

This mantra refers to bhakti yOga or upAsaNa proper.

“samAhitaH” – the gods are his vibhUtIs. They should be meditated as such.

“bhUtam yac ca bhavyam ca sarvE lOkaH pratishtithaH” – As everything is pervaded by him, the entire  universe containing the worlds associated with the three times of past, present and future is established in him, ie, he is the innerself of all. SubalOpanishad says “eSa sarvabhUtAntarAtma apahatapApma divyO deva ekO nArAyaNa:”.

“skambhaH”, “katamaH” – He is the support of his vibhUtis and the foremost as he has everything as his vibhUtis.

yásya tráyastriṃśad devā́ nidhíṃ rákṣanti sarvadā́

nidhíṃ tám adyá kó veda yáṃ devā abhirákṣatha 23

Meaning: He whose wealth (the shAstra), the 33 devas always protect. Who knows that treasure of the form of prapatti (or bhagavAn) now (here, in this samsAra), which is guarded by you devas of godly nature, surrendered unto him?

The first part of this mantra talks about the 33 devas, who are of sattva guNa, protecting bhagavAn’s wealth, which refers to the shAstra. The devas carry out their prescribed tasks as per the upanishadic statements – “in fear of him the wind blows, etc” – and in doing so, protect the shAstra.

The name “draviNa-pradAyaH” in the sahasranAma refers to bhagavAn as the bestower of wealth that is the shAstra – the substance and meaning.

The second part of the mantra talks of nyAsa vidyA or prapatti, which is the fruit of the shAstra. “yam deva” – those of deva bhAva or prapannas who are surrendered to him (yacchati iti yam), always guard this treasure known as prapatti yOga. Or, one can say “nidhim” refers to bhagavAn who is of the nature of being the means, which again, is prapatti. Since prapatti yOga is nothing but considering bhagavAn himself as the means, both “prapatti” and “bhagavAn” are synonymous as sentient means.

“nidhim” – this prapatti or bhagavAn as the means, is the highest knowledge of the sAstra and hence is a treasure. It is always guarded by the prapannas because it is a secret and not revealed to those who are not inclined towards it.

The mahAnArAyaNa Upanishad contains the following statement with reference to prapatti or nyAsa – “mahOpanishadam devAnAm guham” – srI nAyanAr AchAn pillai interprets this as “a secret guarded by the gods like treasure”. “devAnAm” refers to parama sAttvikAs.

The sahasranAma refers to bhagavAn as a treasure in many places. Hence, by use of the word “nidhim”, the double meaning of prapatti indicating bhagavAn is intended, ie, that prapatti is to be guarded just as a treasure is guarded and at the same time, this prapatti is nothing other than considering bhagavAn, who is the true treasure, as the means.

This prapatti can be anga prapatti, ie, surrender performed to destroy obstacles to upAsaNa or svatantara prapatti (considering bhagavAn as the means instead of others like upAsaNa).

“kaH veda” – who knows the extent of his glories? yatO vAcho nivartantE aprApya manasA saha: - his glories are endless. This should be understood by the upAsaka.

Note: srI ranga rAmAnuja muni gives an alternate interpretation for this statement as “this prapatti is a guarded secret difficult to be known by the gods”. I have taken nAyanAr AchAn pillai’s interpretation since it suits the context for the sUkta. However, the difference is minimal and either interpretation does not change the fact that prapatti is the secret.

yátra devā́ brahmavído bráhma jyeṣṭhám upā́sate

yó vái tā́n vidyā́t pratyákṣaṃ sá brahmā́ véditā syāt 24

Meaning: Where (in paramAtma who abides as the inner ruler), those upAsakAs of sAttva bhAva (devA), who know the veda, meditate on the One who is older than Brahma, the supreme Brahman. He who indeed knows by direct perception, is the great knower (brahma veditA) in whom the form of Brahman is manifest.

This mantra shows that only para-vidyA which is upAsaNa leading to brahma-sAkSatkAratva leads to moksha.

“yatra” – where. SrI rAmAnuja mentions in vedArtha sangraha that “where” signifies paramAtma who abides as the inner ruler of all. Everything is his body, which should be the mode of meditation.

“brahmavidO devAh” – those upAsakAs with knowledge of the apara-vidya or the vedas and a sattvika nature owing to practice of yama, niyama, etc.

“jyEshtam” - They meditate on the inner ruler, who is older than Brahma and hence, older than all. This indicates his sarva-seshitvam.

“brahma” – They meditate on the Supreme Brahman. Bhattar interprets this name as follows - “bRhatvAtbrahmaNatvAcca brahmeti parikIrtyate” – He is called Brahman because He is big, and He also makes others big. He is everywhere, He is in everything, He makes everything big, His guNa-s are big, and He performs all His actions without any other support and by his mere samkalpam. He expands the non-sentient matter into gross and subtle, He sustains these in a form that is useful for the jIvAtmA-s to enjoy, He sustains the jIvAtmA-s, He grows them towards their ultimate goal, namely His realization. He does all these only for the benefit of the jIva-s. He is big with countless unsurpassed qualities, by his essential nature, by the glory of his vibhUtIs, etc. His greatness is such that He can lift a baddha jIva – an ordinary samsAri – to the level of a nitya sUri through his infinite mercy.

Thus, “brahma” refers to the extraordinary auspicious attributes of bhagavAn to be meditated on by upAsakAs. This rules out the idea of nirguNa brahman as well.

“vidyAt” – This is para-vidya or knowledge which is of the character of vivid perception and the form of love. The last stage of yOga is brahma-sAkshAtkAram which leads to moksha. This rules out the idea of jivAn mukti.

“saH brahmA veditA syAt” – Direct perception of Brahman leads to instant moksha and thus he knows by direct perception is called “BrahmA veditA” or the great knower. “BrahmA” signifies that in him, after moksha, the form of Brahman is manifested. The mundakOpanishad says “brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati” – the knowers of Brahman become those in whom the form of Brahman is manifested. This means that they will be freed of rAga, dvEsha and others caused by matter having the triguNas, and will manifest in themselves the 8 characteristics of Brahman - apahatapApma (freedom from sin), vijara (freedom from age), vimRtyu, (freedom from death), viSoka (freedom from sorrow), vijigIsa, (freedom from hunger), avipASa (freedom from thirst), satyakAma (desires are true), satyasankalpa (whose will is true).

Thus, they attain moksha.

br̥hánto nā́ma té devā́ yé 'sataḥ pári jajñiré

ékaṃ tád áṅgaṃ skambhásyā́sad āhuḥ paró jánāḥ 25  (?)

Meaning: Those called devas, ie, the indrIyas, who originate severally from the insentient prakrti (asat), are known as great ones as they allow experience of numerous objects of enjoyment.  That one part of the supporter of ubhaya vibhUti is called by those men who know the supreme truth as “asat” or that which is in a constant state of change (temporary due to being born again and again in samsAra).

Having explained the means to attain him (karma, jnAna, bhakti, prapatti yOgas) in the previous mantras, the sUkta now embarks on a description of samsAra. This is to highlight the plight of the baddha jivAs and induce them to perform sAdhana for moksha. Or, since it is necessary to understand the nature of cit, acit and Isvara prior to gaining liberation according to sAstra (jnAnan mOkshO jAyatE \- knowledge leads to liberation), the sUkta embarks on describing the tattvas such as matter and jivAs as well as Isvara who supports both.

“asat” – in the first line, it refers to prakrti since it is different from “sat” which is the jivAtma.

“nAma tE devA” – refers to the indrIyas or senses who are luminous (divi) as they manifest or make visible external objects to the individual self. They originate from matter.

“pari” – means several. The senses are several and the objects of enjoyment they allow experience of is also several.

“bRhantO” – The indriyAs are the great ones as they allow innumerable experiences of several objects of enjoyment.

“skambhah” – The supporter of the 4 parts – 3 parts of which is the nitya vibhUti and one part is leela vibhUti. So, bhagavAn is the supporter of the ubhaya vibhUtIs.

“asat” – in the second line, it refers to samsAra or the baddha jivAs in prakrti who are temporary or in a constant state of change, ie, being born again and again in various forms depending on karma. This is as opposed to nitya vibhUti which is permanent.

“ekam tad angam” – This “asat” or temporary samsAra in which baddha jivAs are born again and again is recognised as one part of skambha.The puruSa sUkta also says - pAdo 'syehAbhavatpuna: - one part alone is manifested again and again.

“parO janaH” – those men who know the supreme truth about the permanence of parama-padam and ephemeral nature of samsAra call that one part as asat or temporary; it is the condition of births and deaths. In other words, these are jnAnis who recognise the tattvas.

yátra skambháḥ prajanáyan purāṇáṃ vyávartayat

ékaṃ tád áṅgaṃ skambhásya purāṇám anusáṃviduḥ 26

Meaning: Where (ie, abiding as the inner self) the supporter of the jivAs in subtle state (skambhah), caused all beings, ancient/ever existing or prior to creation (purANam) (to obtain) names and forms, that one part of the supporter of the jivAs in gross state (skambhah), is to be known (meditated) as “purAnam” or that which though being ancient (Ie, having no beginning and existing eternally), is ever new (being born again and again).

“yatra” – refers to bhagavAn as abiding in all entities as the inner self. As mentioned earlier, srI rAmAnuja says "where" always denotes this meaning in the vedArtha sangraha.

“skambhaH” – In the first line, it means he is the supporter of the jivAs in the sukshma dasa or subtle state before creation. In the next line, it means he is the supporter of the jivAs in the sthUla dasa or gross state.

“prajanayan purAnam vyavartayat” – he caused all beings (prajas), ie, the jivAs, to have names and forms (vyavartayat). Thus the sahasranAma refers to him as “prajAbhavah”. Here, “purANam” can mean that these jivAs exist eternally and are merely said to be born as they are allotted bodies based on karma. Or, “purANam” can mean that these jivAs existed prior to creation in subtle state and were born in the sense of attaining name and form. Either way, the meanings remain the same.

“purANam”  - In the second line, this is interpreted as pura api nayam iti puranam – that which is new despite being old. Though the jivAs have no beginning and exist eternally, they are born again and again in samsAra in new bodies and forms depending on karma.

“anusamviduH” – This tattva, that of the baddhas being born again and again via attainment of names and forms during successive creations, ie, samsAra, is to be meditated upon constantly. The idea is that such meditation will induce disgust in the meditator for his miserable state in samsAra and cause him to seek the means to end the cycle of births and deaths.

yásya tráyastriṃśad devā́ áṅge gā́trā vibhejiré

tā́n vái tráyastriṃśad devā́n éke brahamvído viduḥ 27

Meaning: In whose (paramAtma) limb, the thirty three devas (trayastriMshaddevAH) separated out (vibhejire) the bodies (gAtrAH), Some, well-versed in the vedas, know (the essential natures of) those thirty three gods (as vibhUtis of the supreme brahman).

The thirty three gods are the 8 vasus, 12 adityas, 11 rudras, indra and prajApati. Since we had already seen this earlier, to avoid redundancy, this must be interpreted in the context of sRshti. So this mantra describes how the thirty three gods constituting the limb of Brahman are divided, ie, they were made the presiding deities of certain aspects of prakrti to carry out specific functions according to the will of Brahman.

Yajnavalkya explains this in the brihadAranyaka as follows:

- Fire, Earth, Wind, Ether (antariksha), the sun and heavens, moon and stars are the 8 Vasus. They are called “vasus” since all the precious wealth of the world is placed in them.
    

  

- The 5 jnAnEndiyas, the 5 karmEndriyas along with the mind constitute the 11 rudras. When these rudras depart from the body, they make us weep, hence they are called “rudras”.
    

  

- The 12 months are the 12 adityas. They are called “adityas” as they go taking away the days of living beings with them.
    

  

- The cloud or thunder is Indra. Thunder signifies power or vigor.
    

  

- Sacrifice or animals is Prajapati. Since animals are useful as a means for sacrifice, they can be addressed as sacrifice.
    

  

In this way, does shRshti occur. The worlds are created, bodies are allotted to the jivAs and presiding deities are made to carry out specific functions.

Those well versed in the vedas know that these thirty three gods are indeed vibhUtIs of Brahman. In other words, they recognise that these deities are the vibhUti of that Supreme Brahman who is called “ekaH” as it has none superior to or equal to itself and is distinct and different from everything other than itself (tatasca brahmaNo mahimAn).

hiraṇyagarbhám paramám anatyudyáṃ jánā viduḥ

skambhás tád ágre prā́siñcad dhíraṇyaṃ loké antarā́ 28

Meaning: Men (ie, those who meditate) know that Supreme Brahman designated as “Hiranyagarbha” as he is the auspicious object of meditation, the Supreme and One whose auspicious qualities(which are mediated on) cannot be expressed fully. That foremost object of attainment (agraH), supporter of all desires and objects of enjoyment (skambha), fills gold (enjoyment of his attributes) inside (ie, dwelling as the inner meaning revealed by) the sAstra.

“hiranyagarbhah” is a name which occurs in the sahasranAma. Bhattar interprets it as follows – He is called hiranyagarbhah because he remain concealed in the delightful and lovely hearts of those who contemplate on him. It signifies that he is the auspicious object of meditation. Alternatively, it also means he is like a treasure of gold for the meditators. He alone is to be meditated as the Self of the Universe according to Bhattar. In the context of “janA viduH” as well as previous mantras declaring Brahman to be EkaH and the self of the created universe, this meaning fits well.

“paramam” – He is nArAyaNa, the parabrahman of the Veda.

Bhattar gives several pramAnas under the name “paramAtma” in the vishNu sahasranAma:

“na param puNdarIkAkshAt drsyate bharatarshabha" - There is nothing superior to the Lotus-eyed.

"param hi puNdarIkAkshAt na bhUtam na bhavishyati" - There was nothing in the past, and there will be nothing in the future, that is superior to the Lotus-eyed Lord.

"na daivam kesavAt param: - There is no God superior to Kesava.

"matta: para-taram nAnyat kincidasti" - Greater than Myself, there is nothing else (GitA 7-7)

"param hi amrtam etasmAt visva-rUpAt na vidyate" - There is no greater nectar than the Lord of Universal form.

"parah parANAm paramah paramAtmA" - He is greater than the great; He is superior, and he is the Supreme Soul  (visHNu purANa - 1.2.10)

"paramAtmA ca sarveshAm AdhAra: paramesvara:    |  vishNurnAma sarva-vedeshu vedAnteshu ca gIyate || - The Isvara above all Isvaras, the paramAtmA who is the supporter of every being, is sung by all vedas and vedantas as Lord VishNu. (VishNu purANa 6.4.10)

“anantyudyam” - His auspicious qualities are infinite and cannot be expressed fully – yatO vAchO nivartantE aprApya manasA saha:

Tad agrE skambha – Since the context is about his auspicious qualities being the object of meditation, he is the supporter of all objects of enjoyment and the foremost of the object of enjoyments himself.

“lokE” – Refers to the sAstra according to Bhattar. “loka” means the thing by which we see, ie, the sAstra consisting of shruti, smriti, etc because the sAstra alone can teach us about the gods.

“antarA” – The innermost part of the sAstra, ie, he is the highest secret and innermost meaning of the sAstra.

“prā́siñcad dhíraṇyaṃ” – he fills the sAstra with gold. As “gold” signifies object of desire and enjoyment, it refers to his auspicious attributes which are meditated lovingly upon by the wise, and which are revealed by the sAstra.

skambhé lokā́ḥ skambhé tápaḥ skambhé 'dhy r̥tám ā́hitam

skámbha tvā́ veda pratyákṣam índre sárvaṃ samā́hitam 29

Meaning: The sAstra (lokA) abides in the supporter of the sAstra (skambha). Tapas or penance which is the concentration of the mind abides in the supporter of tapas (skambha). Rtam or the word of truth abides in the supporter of Truth (skambhah). I know you, who are the supporter of all (skambhah), on which everything is established as his inseparable attributes due to being his body (samAhita), as the wealthy (Indra) by vivid perception (pratyaksam).

Rtam is satyavachanam – words of truth. Rtam, tapas and sAstra are accessories to meditation.

“samAhita” – Since everything (cit and acit) is his body, they are his inseparable attributes by way of “aprtak siddham”.

“pratyaksam” – upAsaNa vidhi brahma-sAkSatkAratvam. By meditation of the form of love upon gaining knowledge from the sAstra, Brahman is directly perceived.

“Indra” – The name “mahEndraH” in the sahasranAma means he has great wealth. Bhattar says this is so because since he pervades everything in different ways, he is the lord of everything. The root is “idi” – paramaisvaryE – to own great wealth. The meaning fits the context of “samAhita” as everything is his inseparable attribute by virtue of being his body.

The meaning is that the wise realise that supporter of all, nArAyaNa, as having everything as his body and hence, having everything as his property by direct perception through meditation.

índre lokā́ índre tápa índre 'dhy r̥tám ā́hitam

índraṃ tvā́ veda pratyákṣaṃ skambhé sárvaṃ prátiṣṭhitam 30

Meaning: The sAstra (lokA) abides in the lord who owns the wealth of sAstra (Indra). Tapas or penance which is the concentration of the mind abides in the Lord who owns the wealth of tapas (Indra). Rtam or the word of truth abides in the Lord who owns the wealth of Truth (Indra). I know you, who are wealthy as you are the lord of everything by virtue of pervasion (Indra) as the supporter of existence (skambhah) on whom everything is dependent, ie, depending on him as for their existence and having no separate existence from him, by vivid perception (pratyaksam).

After realising that he is the lord of everything and that everything is his wealth or property by virtue of being his body and inseparable attributes, the meditator realises that the means to such realisation such as sAstra, tapas and Rtam are also owned by him as they constitute his body. Hence, it again leads to the understanding that he himself is the means.

“skambhah” – The meaning is different from what was given earlier. Having realised that he owns everything, the meditator now sees Brahman as the foundation without which other things would not exist.

In the previous mantra, “skambhah” signified the knowledge that Brahman is the supporter of everything. Here, however, “skambhah sarvam pratistithaH” shows that by direct perception, it is realised that everything depends on Brahman as the support for their own existence, ie, they have no separate existence and have utter dependence on him.

Note that as opposed to “samAhita” (connected by being attributes), the word used here is “pratisthita” (dependent). The former word denotes the knowledge that everything is his inseparable attribute by virtue of being his body. The latter word denotes that this knowledge leads to the understanding of seshatva and pAratantrya, ie, they depend on him for their very existence and are hence subservient.

This is again understood by direct perception via meditation.

nā́ma nā́mnā johavīti purā́ sū́ryāt puróṣásaḥ

yád ajáḥ prathamáṃ saṃbabhū́va sá ha tát svarā́jyam iyāya yásmān nā́nyát páram ásti bhūtám 31

Meaning: From the mind (sUrya) and from dawn (of knowledge), the embodied one offers in abundance (johavIti), the nAma (namaha) as the offering, with nAma (namaha) as oblations. That (salutation of namaha) is the essential nature (svarAjyam) which the mover in samsAra (the individual self) came to be before, which he indeed attained. Beyond it nothing higher exists.

“pura” – refers to body and hence to the embodied jivAtma. As Atma dwelling within a body is inseparable from the body, it is referred to by the name “body”.

“sUryAt” – The root “sR” means to move. This refers to the mind, whose thoughts move quickly towards paramAtma.

“uShas” – dawn of knowledge. Azhwar says “pagal kanDen, nArananai kanDen”.  True dawn is when the realization of paramAtma is attained.

“johavIti” – offer oblations in abundance. This signifies prapatti or self-surrender. The jivAs offer themselves to him, ie, they acknowledge that they are his property, which is metaphorically stated by the usage of “offering oblations in abundance”. The nyAsa vidya of mahAnArAyaNopanishad compares nyAsa vidyA (prapatti) to a sacrifice.

“nAma” – the first nAma refers to what is being offered and this is the utterance of “namaha” – not mine. The jivAtma acknowledges that everything, including himself, is a property of paramAtma.

“nAma” – this refers to the means used to surrender to paramAtma and again is the utterance of “namaha” – not mine. In other words, “I do not claim to have undertaken a means to surrender, even that means is yours and you accomplished it”. It relinquishes the idea that the jIvAtma is doing something to attain paramAtma.

“ajaH” – The the root “aj” – movement . Thus, this refers to the individual self moving in samsara.

This “namaha” is said to be “svarAjyam” or the essential nature of the individual self, which it had before (in the sense of always having this essential nature) and has now, by virtue of prapatti, “attained” it, ie, recognized or acknowledged it. Thus, utter dependence and servitude to paramAtma is the essential nature of the self, which was forgotten and is now remembered. There is no puruShArtham higher than this.

yásya bhū́miḥ pramā́ntárikṣam utódáram

dívaṃ yáś cakré mūrdhā́naṃ tásmai jyeṣṭhā́ya bráhmaṇe námaḥ 32

Meaning: Whose base is the Earth, stomach is the intermediary region and who caused the celestial regions to be the head, Salutations to that One who is the eldest and the inner controller of cit and acit.

Since prapatti was the focus of the previous mantra, the following mantras focus on his rulership as the inner controller.  Since protection can be conferred by only Isvara, these mantras establish that nArAyaNa is indeed Isvara by declaring him to be the inner controller of all and the eldest as well.

Earth is the foundation or base since sAdhana is performed for attaining the higher regions here. AntarIksha is the intermediary region and hence his stomach. The celestial regions attained by performance of yajnAs are his head.

“yas cakrE” - By saying this for the celestial region, it is intended that he is indeed the granter of the fruits such as attainment of the higher regions. He is the means.

“jyEsthAya” – One who created Brahma, hence is older than even Brahma and therefore is the eldest. This establishes his Isvaratvam.

brahmaNE – The term “Brahman” refers to sentients and insentient, ie, AtmA and prakrti. Since he is the inner controller of both, he is designated by their name, and hence he is Brahman. This shows that he is the inner controller.

These names occur in the sahasranAma.

“tasmai…namaH” – I surrender only to that Isvara and the inner controller of cit and acit as he alone is capable of protection.

yásya sū́ryaś cákṣuś candrámāś ca púnarṇavaḥ

agníṃ yáś cakrá āsyàṃ tásmai jyeṣṭhā́ya bráhmaṇe námaḥ 33

Meaning: Whose sight is the Sun and the rejuvenating Moon, who made the fires his mouth, Salutations to that One who is the eldest and the inner controller of cit and acit.

It would be better to interpret caksuS as sight and not eye, because both sun and moon are his eyes and sight comprises the set of eyes. Here, the context means that his sight is twofold – one eye is hot like the sun as it looks at the asurAs and the pApa karmas of the jivAs with anger, while the other eye is like the cool moon that looks at his devotees and the punya karmas of the jivAs with grace. “punarnavaH” refers to the act of rejuvenation – his cool glances of grace rejuvenate the jivAs by destroying their ignorance and bestowing them with puruSarthams.

Agni is his mouth as he is the enjoyer of all sacrifices, by virtue of being the inner controller. “yaS cakrE” – once again, he caused the fires to be his mouth in the sense that he, abiding as the inner controller of agni, accepts the oblations.

yásya vā́taḥ prāṇāpānáu cákṣur áṅgirasó 'bhavan

díśo yáś cakré prajñā́nīs tásmai jyeṣṭhā́ya bráhmaṇe námaḥ 34

Meaning: Whose inward and outward breaths are the jivAtmas moving about, eye became the vital air, who effected the quarters (the vyUhAs) his instruments of knowledge, Salutations to that One who is the eldest and the inner controller of cit and acit.

“vAtaH” – means winds and refers to the jivAs moving about, abodeless and immortal.The jivAs move about like wind owing to the extent of their knowledge and karmas. Like air that is inhaled and expelled out of the body, the jivAs take up a material body and leave it, thus they do not have a permanent abode.This is the explanation of srI vedAnta desikan in his isavasyOpanishad bhAshya.

“angirasa” – the essence of the organs is praNa which is the eye. The eye is known as the sustainer (cakSurvAva pratiStita) since it shows the even and uneven surface of the earth and helps in being stationed firmly. Similarly, mukhyaprAna is celebrated as the sustainer of the body, without which other organs cannot function.

The quarters refer to the 4 vyUhAs – vAsudeva, sankarshana, pradyumna and aniruddha – the states of vaisvAnara, taijasa, prajna and turIya - who cause the jivAs to experience, hence they are known as prajnAnIs.

“yas cakrE” – The 4 vyUhAs are the effects, ie, manifestations of the supreme brahman.

skambhó dādhāra dyā́vāpr̥thivī́ ubhé imé skambhó dādhārorv àntárikṣam

skambhó dādhāra pradíśaḥ ṣáḍ urvī́ḥ skambhá idáṃ víśvaṃ bhúvanam ā́ viveśa 35

Meaning: The supporter of the earth and celestial regions (Skambha) sustains (as the inner self) both the celestial regions and earth, the supporter of the intermediary region (Skambha), sustains (as the inner self) the intermediary region, the supporter of the directions (Skambha) sustains (as the inner self) the 6 wide directions of the worlds, the supporter of the jivAs (Skambha) has fully entered and pervaded (with the jivAs as his body) these worlds.

Each time the name “skambha” is used, it is interpreted differently to avoid redundancy based on the context, as above.

“skambha idam viSvam bhuvanam A vivEsha” – As bhagavAn already pervades everything, there is no question of his entry. This statement, as explained before, refers to the jivAs, who are the body of bhagavAn and hence, owing to aprtak siddham (inseparability) are designated the same terms as paramAtma. These jivAs, being the body of paramAtma and having paramAtma as their inner self, fill the created universe by entering into gross forms, ie, bodies allotted to them on the basis of karmas. Hence the Universe is filled with jivAs. Since these jivAs are inseparable attributes of paramAtma, their entry is referred to as his entry, ie, he enters and fills the universe as the inner self of the jivAs and having them as his body.

yáḥ śrámāt tápaso jātó lokā́nt sárvānt samānaśé

sómaṃ yáś cakré kévalaṃ tásmai jyeṣṭhā́ya bráhmaṇe námaḥ 36

Meaning: He (as the inner self of Brahma), who is born (jAtaH), by laborious tapas (knowledge), attained easily all the worlds (sam+Anashe); who (as the inner controller of Brahma) alone effected the objects of enjoyment (sOma), Salutations to that One who is the eldest and the inner controller of cit and acit.

The first part refers to vyastha shrShti or creation of Brahma, who was born by virtue of tapas. Because Brahma is the body of paramAtma, it can be said that paramAtma, as the inner self of Brahma, is born. This Brahma, or paramAtma as the inner self of Brahma, attained all theworlds easily, ie, he became their Lord. Brahma then conducted samastha shRshti or creation of the Universe with it’s objects of enjoyment.

“kevalaM” signifies that it is only paramAtma as the indweller of Brahma who created the Universe with its objects of enjoyment through Brahma, the latter being an instrument. To that Sriman nArAyaNa who is the indweller of Brahma, salutations.

katháṃ vā́to nélayati katháṃ ná ramate mánaḥ

kím ā́paḥ satyáṃ prépsantīr nélayanti kadā́ caná 37

Meaning: How does the jivAtma, which moves ceaselessly in samsAra, never abides (permanently in one body)? How does the mind never stay still? Do the waters, ie, the senses (kim ApaH), indeed desiring to reach the individual self, (satyaM prepsantiH), not stay still (na ilayanti), ever (kadA ca na)?

The previous mantras described the nature of Brahman as the inner controller and the creation of the Universe. So now, the means to liberation from samsara is explored.

One of the methods is jnAna yOga, which is meditation on the jIvAtma, which in turn would lead to knowledge of the jIvAtma as a servant of paramAtma. This would lead to bhakti yOgA. But the question arises – is it easier to meditate on the jIvAtma, or on paramAtma?

This rk explains that meditation on the jIvAtma is difficult.The questions are of the form of brahma-jignyAsa and the idea is that the upAsaka needs to meditate on these aspects sequentially as part of jnAna yOga.

“vAtaH” – As explained earlier, this refers to the jivAtma moving in samsAra. The yOgI intending to meditate on the jIvAtma needs to have an understanding of the panchAgni vidyA, which details the process of birth and death of the jivAtma. He must be constantly meditating on the five fires. This way, he will gain Atma sAkshAtkAram and meditate on the essential nature of the jivAtma.

“na ramatE manaH” – As pAn perumAl says, “mandhi pAi vada vEnkata mAmAlai” – the mind is compared to monkeys moving constantly. The mind is very fickle and easily attracted to samsAra again. So, if the mind is made to focus on the essential nature of the jivAtma by the yOgi, there is a very good chance that it will not stay focused – rather, it is very difficult for the upAsaka to meditate on the jivAtma as the mind is difficult to control. This is mentioned in the gita by Arjuna (6.34) in the context of meditating on the mind.

“kim ApaH satyam…” – The senses are always inclined towards the pursuit of the objects of enjoyment. The object of jnAna yOga is to direct the indrIyas inwards towards meditation on the individual self which is designated as “satyam”. But it is difficult to do so when the senses are tempted towards external objects. In such a situation, is it entirely possible for the upAsaka to queiten the senses by meditation on the individual self? The answer is no.

The term “ApaH” does not merely indicate “water” as explained earlier but the senses which are composed of subtle elements denoted by “water”.

To sum up, this mantra says that meditation on the jivAtma to understand it’s essential nature and proceed to bhagavad upAsaNa is impractical. This is the answer given by bhagavAn to the question posed by Arjuna in Gita 12.1.

mahád yakṣáṃ bhúvanasya mádhye tápasi krāntáṃ salilásya pr̥ṣṭhé

tásmin chrayante yá u ké ca devā́ vr̥kṣásya skándhaḥ paríta iva śā́khāḥ 38

Meaning: The great yakSha, in the orb of the Sun, who overcomes samsAra for his devotees by the quality of knowledge or “tapas”, resides on the surface of the waters. In that (Brahman), all the devas, without exception (ye u ke ca devAH), take refuge (shrayante), just as (iva) branches of a tree (vR^ikShasya shAkAH) that is dense (paritaH) are to its trunk (skandhaH).”

As the previous mantra describes the difficulties of meditating on the individual self, which is part of jnAna yOga, this rk gives the solution.  Sri krishNa explains in the gita that his beautiful form which is suddha sattvam, of unsurpassable loveliness, his weapons and ornaments and his essential nature along with the innumerable auspicious attributes, are far superior to the individual self and hence, anyone who focuses his mind on the svarUpa-rUpa-guNa-vibhUti of bhagavAn will be able to control their mind and senses easily and constantly meditate on bhagavAn.

Thus, either bhagavAn can be meditated on for the goal of accomplishing jnAna yOga, which is to attain the nature of the essential self, or he can be meditated on for the sole purpose of attaining him. For both jnAna and bhati yOga, meditation on bhagavAn alone is recommended over the meditation of the individual self.

As the svarUpa-rUpa-guNa-vibhUti of Brahman are alone worthy of meditation in yOga, this mantra shows that Brahman has taken up specific forms in specific places and is resorted to by those with knowledge of their seshatvam, which is crucial for bhakti yOga.

Mahad-yakSham – “mahad” means great. “ya + kSa” – he is the great one who destroys that which moves, ie, he destroys the indrIyas and mind which move towards sense objects. Or, he destroys the movement in samsara.

“bhuvanasya madhyE” – refers to the orb of the sun.

“tapasI krAntam” – he possesses the knowledge (tapas) to lead his devotees out of samsAra, thereby overcoming (krantam) samsAra for his devotees.

“salilasya prsthE” – he resides on the waters of the milky ocean. The reference here is to “ambhasya pArE, bhuvanasya madhyE” mantra in the mahAnArAyaNa Upanishad which talks of his residence in the solar orb and the waters of the milky ocean.

All take refuge in that Brahman, recognising him as the master and themselves as servants. They consider themselves inseparable to him as the branches of a tree are to the tree; ie, aprthak-siddhi between the individual self and paramAtma is realised. They also realise the sesha-seshi bhAva which is true knowledge and the culmination of bhakti yOga.

yásmai hástābhyāṃ pā́dābhyāṃ vācā́ śrótreṇa cákṣuṣā

yásmai devā́ḥ sádā balíṃ prayáchanti vímité 'mitaṃ skambháṃ táṃ brūhi katamáḥ svid evá sáḥ 39

Meaning: Say that the support of seshatvam, the true nature of the jivAtma (skambhah) and who is the foremost as he is the enjoyer who accepts the services of his devotees (katamah) (is he) unto whom those with hands, those with feet, those with mouths, those with ears, those with eyes, unto whom the nitya sUrIs, fixed on the immeasurable (auspicious attributes), uninterruptedly worship by offering (services).

The previous mantra talked about sesha-seshi bhAva. This mantra shows the anushtAnam of that knowledge, ie, how it is put into practice. The idea of saying “those with hands, those with feet”, etc is to show the twofold view that:

- The very existence of such body parts is to serve him. Hands to form the Anjali mudra, eyes to see his beautiful form, ears to hear his glories, feet to run towards his temples and mouths to praise him. If these body parts do not do these functions, then they are not fit to be called body parts.
    

  

- It is also to highlight that devotees perform different varieties of services – some use their mouths to praise him, some perform physical services with hands and feet (such as making garlands, building temples, etc) that this usage with reference to organs is employed.
    

  
  

“devAh sadA balim” – This is a parallel to “sadA paSyanti suraya:” The term “deva” refers to nitya sUrIs. “sadA” – they are uninterruptedly worshipping him.

“prayachanti” – Refers to offer of all types of services at all times and all places to bhagavAn. Lakshmana also says “ahaM sarvam karishyAmi” – I will perform all types of services at all times and all places to srI rAghavan.

“vimitEmitam” – “vimita” means fixed, ie, they are always meditating. “amitam” means immeasurable and refers to his unlimited auspicious attributes. So, they are always meditating on his auspicious attributes.

The first part of the mantra talking about devotees serving him with hands, feet, etc can be taken as a general reference to all devotees while the special usage of “deva” can be taken as a reference to nitya sUrIs. Or, it is also possible to take “devas” as referring to the devotees or prapannas with sAttvika bhAva (knowledge of seshatvam) serving him with hands, feet, etc and meditating on his kalyAna guNas.

“skambhah, katamaH” – He is thus the support of true nature of the jivAtma, which is seshatvamsince service cannot exist without the master to serve. He is also the foremost one as he alone accepts the services offered to him by such devotees.

ápa tásya hatáṃ támo vyā́vr̥ttaḥ sá pāpmánā sárvāṇi tásmin jyótīṃṣi yā́ni trī́ṇi prajā́patau 40

Meaning: Which three lights (rik, yajus and sAman) are in the Lord of all sentients and non-sentients (PrajApati), all (knowledge) is in that. By his (supreme power of vishNu that resides resplendent in the sun), darkness or prakrti is dispelled and sin is removed. He is uncovered by sins.

This mantra is a reference to the Aditya Mandala. In that is the flame in which abide the three purushas of the form of Rk, Saman and Yajus, with their mandalas and lokas. So, in the form of these three, the vidya or knowledge alone of the three vedas is shining out. The yOgIs see this form of the mandala of the three vedas as having a beautiful auspicious form and meditate on that.

Hence, “trini jyOtImsi” refers to the rk, yajus and saman. “sarvAni tasmin” – the knowledge or vidyA of the three vedas is present in this. Since there are different types of knowledge and different things to attain knowledge about, it is in plural (sarvAni). Sriman nArAyaNa is prajApati, or the lord of all sentients and insentients abiding in the sun.

The vishNu purAna contains the following statement,

sarvashaktiH purA visnoH rk yajus sAmas-saMJita

saiSa trayee tapatyaMho jagatashra hiMsati yA (~vishNu purAna 2.11.7)

Meaning: The Supreme Power of vishNu is signified by the names Rik, Yajus and Saman; this trayee burns all sins and that resides resplendent in the Sun.

“vyAvR^ittaH sa pApmanA” - He is devoid of sins or karmas. This is according to “eSha sarvabhUtAntarAtmA apahatapApmA divyo deva eka nArAyaNaH” in the subalOpanishad.

yó vetasáṃ hiraṇyáyaṃ tiṣṭhantaṃ salilé véda sá vái gúhyaḥ prajā́patiḥ 41

Meaning: The one who knows the golden (jIvAtma associated with desire), situated in the waters (subtle elements), established in the perishable (avyaktAkAsa/unmanifest ether) woven as warp and woof, is indeed the hidden Lord of all sentients and insentients.

The brihadAranyaka Upanishad contains a dialogue between Gargi and YajnavAlkya which explains the meaning of the rk.

“hiranyayam” – golden, signifies rajas or desire. The jIvAtma in samsAra is inseparably associated with desire, thus it is called “desire” itself by virtue of aprthak-siddhi.

“salile” – the waters, ie, the subtle elements denoted by the term. They cause rajas or desire by association with the jIvAtma

“vetasa” – vayate tasyati iti vetasa – the perishable which is woven as warp and woof. The perishable is nothing but the unmanifest ether. The brihadAraNyaka Upanishad refers to Brahman as “Akshara” or “Immutable/Imperishable”, as the support of this akAsha. Hence, to drive home this difference, the ether has been referred to as perishable.

One must note that Akasha here does not signify vAyu and that which is evolved because that elemental ether is not the source of evolution. It refers to unmanifest ether or avyAktAkAsha.

Guhyah – The Lord, who is hidden, is the support of that AkAsha which in turn supports the subtle elements, that are associated with the jIvAtma. The name occurs in the sahasranAma and Bhattar explains how he is hidden as follows – his divyAtma svarUpa is concealed by his divine body (divya mangala vigraha) which is aprAkrta and pachOpanishad mayam.

“prajApati” – This Brahman is the Lord of all sentients and insentients.

tantrám éke yuvatī́ vírūpe abhyākrā́maṃ vayataḥ ṣáṇmayūkham prā́nyā́ tántūṃs tiráte dhatté anyā́ nā́pa vr̥ñjāte ná gamāto ántam 42

Meaning: The two young devIs, srI devi and bhUmi devi (yuvatI), each of whom is unique (matchless in auspicious attributes and stature), having different natures/forms (virUpE), go towards ie, resort or surrender for mediation (vayatE), the “loom” or principal means (tantra), ie, sriman nArAyaNa, who has the sixfold nature, ie, characterized by 6 attributes (sanmayUkham) by repeatedly appealing for puruSakAram (abhyAkramam). One of them (srI devI) crosses over or draws out, ie, redeems (tirate) the jIvAs signified by “threads” (tantU), the other one (bhU devI) fixes them (in meditation on paramAtma). They never interrupt (their labor), nor do they reach the end (of their mediation).

yuvatI virUpE tantram eke – This refers to Lakshmi and BhU Devi. Both are unique or matchless in their own way with auspicious qualities but have different physical forms, or natures of wealth and modesty respectively. But their intent and function is only one, which is puruSakAram or mediation.

abhyAkramam – They repeatedly appeal to bhagavAn on save the jivAs.

vayataH – They move towards bhagavAn. In other words, they perform puruSakAram by themselves surrendering first to bhagavAn, so that he grants their wish to save the jivAs.

tantra – This refers metaphorically to a loom, and also has the meaning of the underlying principle or means.  Just as the loom or frame is the base to weave the cloth, paramAtma is the underlying means for all sAdhaNas.

sanmayUkham – This refers to bhagavAn who shines with the 6 attributes of jnAna, balam, veeryam, aishwaryam, Shakti and tejas required to save the jivAs. In other words, he alone has the power to protect.

prAnyA tantUMstirate – srI dEvI crosses over, ie, wins over or redeems the erring jIvAs (tiratE). The They listen to her advice by being attracted to her “vAtsalya guNa” (affection) and are won over. This is illustrated in the case of sIta who protected kAkAsura. BhU devI ensures that the jIvAs who have been redeemed remain fixed in their conviction that bhagavAn is the means, as they keep meditating on his auspicious attributes. This is illustrated by how bhU devI obtained the charama slOka from varAha.

The jIvAs are called “threads” because they are woven about or supported by the “loom” or underlying principle which is paramAtma.

“nApa vR^i~njAte na gamato antam” – This can be interpreted in two ways. If we take it as referring to the two devIs, it means they never interrupt their labor of mediation as they do not change their favorable disposition to the jIvAs. And they also never reach the end of it, ie, even if the jIvA attains moksha, it requires their mediation to enjoy paramAtma eternally.

If we take this as pertaining to the jIvAs signified by “tantU” rather than the devIs, it means this – that after being redeemed by the devIs, these jIvAs never interrupt their meditation on paramAtma as the means, and they never reach the end of such meditation as his auspicious qualities are inexhaustible.

This rk can be summed up in a nutshell by srI vedAnta desikan’s words in the rahasya ratnAvali:

“sarva swAminiyAy, sarvEshwaranukku seshamAy, saha-dharmachAriniAna periya pirAttiar, ithalayilE vAtsalyAdhisiyatAlum, athalayilE vAllabhyadhisiyatAlum, purushakAramAy konDu, ijjivargalluku thanjam AgirAl”

Here, Acharya says that Lakshmi, who is the SarvEsvarI, the servant of SarvEshvara (sriman nArAyaNa), who aids him in his dharma of sharanAgata rakshaNam by herself being the puruSakAra bhUtai (mediator), attracts the jivA to obey her by virtue of her affection and attracts bhagavAn to obey her because of her beauty and thus, by virtue of puruSakAram or such mediation, she becomes the cause of protection (rakSana hetu) for the jivA.

táyor aháṃ parinŕ̥tyantyor iva ná ví jānāmi yatarā́ parástāt

púmān enad vayaty úd gr̥ṇanti púmān enad ví jabhārā́dhi nā́ke 43

Meaning: Of the two consorts (tayor), acting alike for the sake of the jivA (parinRtyantor), I do not know, which is the superior (in attributes). The jIvAtma (pUmAn) goes, ie, resorts to the paramAtma who is the underlying principle or means (enad). Besides (being the means now), he (the paramAtma) bore or sustained it (the jIvAtma), in the supreme abode (nAka) which celebrates (paramAtma).

It is not possible to distinguish the greatness of the two consorts. Their kindness towards all jivAs, ability to tolerate the faults of the jivAs and steadfastedness in seeking the protection of bhagavAn for the jivAs are equal. The veda purusha wonders – can I ever say which one is superior in guNams?

“parinRtyantor” – nRtya refers to acting as puruSakAra bhUtai or mediator. “pari” – for the sake of the jivAs.

“pumAn” – Refers to the jIvAtma.

“vayatE” – resorts to paramAtma.

“enad” – refers to the “tantra” or means mentioned in the previous rk, ie, paramAtma.

The second line simply means that not only does paramAtma act as the means here, but also in srI vaikunta, he is the means for the jIvAs to enjoy him. Thus, “upAyatva” or being the means is his essential nature and continues eternally.

imé mayū́khā úpa tastabhur dívaṃ sā́māni cakrus tásarāṇi vā́tave 44

Meaning: These, lustrous (mayUkhA) jnAnIs with extended dharma bhUta jnAnam or attributive knowledge, stopped/immobilized the mind which is shining (divam) and made the sAmans into the shuttles or means, for movement (in all worlds or towards paramAtma).

Due to such puruShakAram,these jIvAs became lustrous due to extended dharma bhUta jnAna and stopped the movement of the fickle mind. Here, the mind is called “divam” as it is shining due to perception of sense objects through the indrIyAs.

These jnAnIs sing the sAmAns and move. The movement can be taken as “singing the sAmAns, which are a praise of paramAtma’s auspicious qualities, and move or resort to paramAtma”.

Alternatively, another way to take it is by Shruti which says “sarvAn lOkAn kAmAni kAmarUpyanusancharan” - the devas or the liberated move in all worlds like  dyulOka, prithvi and others. They move among all objects in all directions. They also move in the abode of the Supreme Brahman, Sriman nArAyaNa. This they do by virtue of being free of karma. The purpose of such movement is to serve bhagavAn at all times, all places and in all states.

Ultimately, both meanings are the same. And thus, the first part of the sUkta concludes by emphasising the upAyatva of bhagavAn, the puruShakAratva of his devIs and the seshatva of the jIvAs.

  


yó bhūtáṃ ca bhávyaṃ ca sárvaṃ yáś cādhitíṣṭhati

sv àryásya ca kévalaṃ tásmai jyeṣṭhā́ya bráhmaṇe námaḥ 1

Meaning: He who is (pervades) that which was and that which will be (as well as that which is), who is also the ruler of all (as he is their inner self), of whom alone is the everlasting enjoyment or the supreme abode (that is to be attained by all), Salutations to that One who is the eldest and the inner controller of sentients and insentients.

This is similar to “bhUtam yac ca bhavyam ca sarvE lOkaH pratishtithaH” which occurred earlier – As everything is pervaded by him, the entire  universe containing the worlds associated with the three times of past, present and future is established in him, ie, he is the innerself of all. SubalOpanishad says “eSa sarvabhUtAntarAtma apahatapApma divyO deva ekO nArAyaNa:”.

“svaH” refers to his nature of being the enjoyment for all owing to his auspicious attributes. Alternatively, it also refers to the supreme abode that belong to him.

“jyEsthAya” – One who created Brahma, hence is older than even Brahma and therefore is the eldest. This establishes his Isvaratvam.

brahmaNE – The term “Brahman” refers to sentients and insentient, ie, AtmA and prakrti. Since he is the inner controller of both, he is designated by their name, and hence he is Brahman. This shows that he is the inner controller.

skambhénemé víṣṭabhite dyáuś ca bhū́miś ca tiṣṭhataḥ

skambhá idáṃ sárvam ātmanvád yát prāṇán nimiṣác ca yát 2

By Skambha (the support of the two vibhUtIs) alone, srI vaikunta and prakrti mandalam are supported  and also established. Skambha (the support of existence) is all this world (skaMbhaH +idam)having as its self that which breathes and that which blinks (ie, the living beings or sentients).

“skambhaneme” – refers to the fact that he alone (nema) is the self-dependent one by whom the nitya and leela vibhUtIs are supported as his body and also exist (established) only because he is their indweller.

The world, which includes both samsAra mandalam and paramapadam, is said to have as its self the living beings – baddhas, muktas and nityas. This is because the world exists on account of being filled by these living beings and serving as their object of enjoyment, otherwise it wouldn’t exist. Hence, the living beings are collectively the self of the existing world.

Skambha is the inner controller of the supreme abode as well as the material world that has the living beings as its self, and also the inner controller of the living beings, by virtue of having everything as his body.

tisró ha prajā́ atyāyám āyan ny ànyā́ arkám abhíto 'viśanta

br̥hán ha tasthau rájaso vimā́no hárito háriṇīr ā́ viveśa 3

Going beyond (atyAyam), the three guNas which are the offspring (prajA) of the evolutes of prakrti, (the individual self) attains it (the supreme abode). Into those other than or different to the supreme abode, ie, the gross forms (anyA), entered (avishanta), the paramAtma (as the inner self of the bound selves) known by the name “arka” from all sides, ie, in all directions (abhitaH). The great one , paramAtma, (brham) indeed (ha) remained unchanged (tasthau) despite being the indweller of the bound selves in gross forms. From (as a consequence of) “rajas” or the quality of passion, the bound self without a dwelling (vimAna), that is golden or associated with desire (haritaH) entered (Avivesha) the gross forms which are golden as they enable experience of the objects of desire (hariNIH).

The previous rk described the two abodes, nitya and leela vibhUtis as supported by Skambha. This rk talks about how these two abodes are attained.

The liberated jIva transcends the three guNas – sattva, rajas, tamasand attains the supreme abode which is suddha sattvam.  In contrast, those still in samsAra enter gross forms within the Universe, which are different to the nitya vibhUti which is suddha sattva, as they are made of guNa trayi.

Here, the rk says, “paramAtma known as arka, entered the gross forms from all sides”. The meaning is that, paramAtma, as the inner self of the bound selves, entered the gross forms. It is the individual selves who are entering the gross forms and by virtue of sAmAnAdhikaraNyam and sharIrAtma bhAva, the paramAtma who is their indweller and who has them as his body is said to enter these forms.

“arka” – paramAtma is food as he sustains the jIvAs and jagat as indweller. Without him, they do not exist. Despite being the indweller and having the gross forms as his body, he is still the great one(brhan)  and remains unchanged.

“vimAna haritaH” – “vimAna” means devoid of an abode or dwelling. The transmigrating self is always changing bodies and is said to be without a permanent dwelling. “haritaH” (yellow/golden) signifies association with desire.

“harinIH” – Entry into gross bodies allow experience of the objects of desire. Hence, these gross forms are said to be yellow/golden.

dvā́daśa pradháyaś cakrám ékaṃ trī́ṇi nábhyāni ká u tác ciketa

tátrā́hatās trī́ṇi śatā́ni śaṅkávaḥ ṣaṣṭíś ca khī́lā ávicācalā yé 4

Meaning: One is the wheel, twelve segmented, with three naves, who has understood it? In that is fixed the three hundred spokes and sixty pins which are not subject to destruction, ie, exists eternally.

Time is the wheel. The twelve segments are the twelve months and the three naves are the three seasons – vasanta, grishma and sarad. Only these three seasons out of the 6 are suitable for sacrifice and hence they have been mentioned. The puruSa sUkta – 6 (vasanto asyAsI-dAjyam | grIshma idhma Saraddhavi:) too alludes that the puruSa yajna was performed in these three seasons.

The three hundred days are the spokes and to that 60 days (pins) are added to make the samvatsara or year. This time is not subject to creation or destruction (avivAcAlaH); it is a dravya and eternally exists as elucidated by srI vedAnta desikan in tattva mukta kalApa.

“Who has understood Kala?” Ie, Time is responsible for all the changes in the world – this is said by mahAbali to Indra in the mahAbhArata. Azhwar also says “oru nAyagamAi oda ulagudan Andavar” – over time, riches are lost and gained, the high become low and vice-versa. The idea is that samsAra operates within the realm of time and all baddhas are controlled by time.

Sriman nArAyaNa is the inner controller of kAla as he has kAla as his body.

idáṃ savitar ví jānīhi ṣáḍ yamā́ éka ekajáḥ

tásmin hāpitvám icchante yá eṣām éka ekajáḥ 5

Meaning: Know this, O Savitr (the individual self that is the prompter of the intellect). Six are the rulers which are the indriyAs. One is the mind, that is solitary or the chief (one of its kind). Whosoever is that solitary mind, with that indeed is friendship desired by all.

“Savitr” – he who stirs or prompts our “dhIya:” or dormant jnAnEndrIyas is Savitr. This normally refers to paramAtma, but here one can say that “Savitr” here refers to the individual self that also prompts or directs its intellect in the secondary sense.

The mind is the chief of the senses. As the Gita says, the mind can be our friend aiding us to meditate on Brahman, or our enemy in swaying us to the objects of attachment that lead to samsAra. Hence, friendship with the mind is desired.

āvíḥ sán níhitaṃ gúhā járan nā́ma mahát padám

tátredáṃ sárvam ā́rpitam éjat prāṇát prátiṣṭhitam 6

Meaning:  (The akshara puruSa is) directly realised by the yogins, very near as it is moving in the heart, well known as  inscrutable, it is the supreme object of attainment. On it are fixed all the beings that move, that breathe and that do not blink.

This mantra occurs in a modified form in the mundakOpanishad and is a description of the akshara puruSa. “AviH” refers to being directly intuited by yogis. This is because it is “sannihitam”, ie, present in the cave of the heart. It is well known as that which is very difficult to be known.

“ejat” signifies the waking state. “prANat” signifies the beings that breathe – this also includes the state of deep sleep which is conveyed more clearly by the mundakOpanishad mantra which says “nimishath”. The idea is that all living beings in different states are fixed on this akshara puruSa.

ékacakraṃ vartata ékanemi sahásrākṣaraṃ prá puró ní paścā

ardhéna víśvaṃ bhúvanaṃ jajā́na yád asyārdháṃ kvà tád babhūva 7

Meaning: The supremely Independent, abides as the (inner controller of) thewheel of time, the innumerable jivAs designated as “akshara”, prior to that which is ancient (the individual self) and entering that which comes later (the created Universe). By one part (it is) fully connected with the worlds that are born (as inseparable attributes). That other part of his (puruSa), where does it remain?

“Ekachakram” – He is the matchless, unrivalled and the supreme master of all who is independent.

“ekanemi” – “nemi” refers to the rims of a wheel. “EkaH” means that which is the chief or which is alone. This refers to akhanda kAla or time which is the chief as it is infinite (vibhu), the primary substance (dravya) which undergoes modifications in the form of days, weeks, hours, etc, which is alone not subject to creation and dissolution unlike prakrti and jivAs, which neither has a beginning or an end and which holds the entirety of samsAra under its sway.

This wheel of time is nothing but avidya or ignorance according to the following pramAna quoted by Bhattar under the nAma “kAlanemi nihA” in the sahasranAma:

avidyAkhyA ca yA nemih kAlacakrasya durdharA   |sA mayIyam samASritya vigraham vidhunoti ca   ||

“avidyA (Ignorance) is an irresistible folly of the wheel of Time;  when it comes to me (vishNu), it loses its form”.  

“sahasrAksharam” – refers to the infinite (sahasra) jivAs which are imperishable (akshara). The idea is that bhagavAn is the inner controller of both the wheel of time, which is the ignorance of samsAra and the jivAs.

“pra purO” – “pra” denotes the quality of being prior to or superior. “pura” refers to the ancient jivAtma which has no beginning.

“ni paSca” – He also enters (ni) the universe which comes later (paSca). Ie, he, as the self of the individual jives and having them as his body thus enters via the medium of the jivAs as they fill up the Universe of names and forms.

The next part of the mantra only echoes the puruSa sUkta rk - pAdo 'sya vishvA bhUtAni, tripAdasyAmRtam divi. This was explained earlier.

Here, the mantra splits the puruSa into two halves or portions (ardha). One portion or ardha includes “pAdo 'sya vishvA bhUtAni” and the other portion includes “tripAdasyAmRtam divi”. Since one part is the leela vibhUti and the other three parts are located in nitya vibhUti, the latter three parts are grouped as one on the basis of their location and function being the same to get two parts in total. This interpretation is necessary to avoid conflict with the puruSA sUkta.

pañcavāhī́ vahatyágram eṣāṃ práṣṭayo yuktā́ anusáṃvahanti

áyātam asya dadr̥śé ná yātáṃ páraṃ nédīyó 'varaṃ dávīyaḥ 8

Meaning: The mind that bears or possesses the five senses of knowledge (panchavAhI), proceeds (vahati) in front (agram) as it guides the senses. The tanmAtrAs that exist by the side of those (the senses), who are connected to the experiences of sense objects (yuktA), together with the senses (anusam), go towards (vahanti) the mind (in obedience). Of this mind in control of the senses (asya), that (quality) of not being situated in experience of sense objects (ayAtam) is perceived (dadrsE).The supreme goal(paraM) is very near or attainable (nedIyaH) to that (mind) situated in the individual self (yAtam). It (that supreme goal) is not that which is inferior or the lowest goal, viz., experience of the objects of enjoyment (avaram) and that which is distant or unattainable, viz., the experience of the individual self (davIyaH).

The mind leads the five senses of knowledge. The five senses are the basis for the functions of the senses which are the tanmAtrAs, that allow experience of the objects of enjoyment. The five senses and tanmAtrAs always go towards the mind in that they are obedient to the latter.

such a mind, which can control the senses, experience of sense objects and the pleasure/pain arising from them is not perceived. “yAta” means “situated”. “ayAta” – “not situated in experience of sense objects”.

It is not enough for the mind to be merely detached from sense objects. The mind should also be situated (yAtam) in meditation on the essential nature of the individual self as being subordinate to Brahman. For such a mind which is detached from sense objects (ayAta) and situated in the individual self (yAtam), the supreme goal (param) is near.

This supreme goal is nothing but experience of the auspicious attributes of Brahman. This goal is different to that which is the inferior goal which include the loukika puruSarthas like svarga, etc designated as “avaram” or inferior. This supreme goal is also not the goal of experiencing the bliss of the individual self which is distant or difficult to attain (alternatively, the experience of the individual self is “distant” because it is distant to or against the essential nature of the self which is subservience to Brahman).

tiryágbilaś camasá ūrdhvábudhnas tásmin yáśo níhitaṃ viśvárūpam

tád āsata ŕ̥ṣayaḥ saptá sākáṃ yé asyá gopā́ maható babhūvúḥ 9

Meaning: There is a bowl that has its opening below and it bulges at the top. Various kinds of glory (or yaSas) have been put in it.The seven sages sit by its side along with (the organ of speech) who have become the protectors of the veda.

The BrihadAraNyaka Upanishad 2-2-3 explains this curious mantra which is related to mukhyaprANa. The bowl with the opening below and which bulges at the top is the head. This is because the mouth is below of the form of an opening and hence is called “tiryagbilas” and the skull above. The various glories kept in it refers to the prANas. “viSvarUpam nihitam” refers to the prANas with different functions like prana, apana and others.  It is said to be “viSvarUpam” or manifold on account of different functions. This air spreads like yaSas.

The seven organs of the head (two nostrils, the two eyes, the two ears and the mouth) are described metaphorically as the seven sages seated by it. The word “sAkam” denotes that these organs are present together along with the organ of speech which communicates with the Vedas. Although the organ of speech is counted as the seventh among the seven sages in the form of eating food, the word “sAkam” also signifies that it is counted as the eighth in a different form, ie, in the form of reciting the vedas.

The word “mahat” refers to the Vedas and these organs along with the organ of speech that communicates with the vedas and the mouth which has union with the vedic recitation are hence described as the protectors of the vedas.

yā́ purástād yujyáte yā́ ca paścā́d yā́ viśváto yujyáte yā́ ca sarvátaḥ

yáyā yajñáḥ prā́ṅ tāyáte tā́ṃ tvā pr̥chāmi katamā́ sā́ r̥cā́m 10

Meaning: That which is prior or ancient (para-vAsudevA), possessed of all auspicious attributes (yujyatE), and that which also comes later(vyUha) that is present in everything by virtue of being associated with everything as its body (antaryAmin), that which also has numerous forms (archa), That which proceeds as sacrifice, ie, acts for the benefit of devotees (vibhava), protects by being in front –which of those, I ask you, is the foremost of those worshippable forms?

The meaning should be clear. These are the various forms of paramAtma – para, vyUha,vibhava, antaryAmin and archa. The superior form is indeed archa, the form in temples and houses owing to its excessive simplicity and ease of accessibility. “sarvataH” – he is present in numerous archa avatAra forms.

prAn tAyatE – he stands in front and protects. The quality of being in front is a reference to the praNava where bhagavAn is the “akAra” (akArasya viSnoH) and in front of the jivA which is “makAra”. In the paramArtha stUti, srI vedAnta desikan says” abhirakshithum agratha: sTitham ThvAM PraNavE PaarTaraTE cha bhAvayantha:” – He is the akAra in praNava which signifies sarva rakshagatvam, and he also sat in the front portion of Arjuna’s chariot.

Feminine gender for “yA” etc. is applicable since it qualifies the word “devatA” as in “yA devatA” “yayA devatayA” etc.

Protection is the primary purpose of assuming these 5 forms. Which of these forms is the best? It is the form in temples, which is the answer given in the following mantra.

yád éjati pátati yác ca tíṣṭhati prāṇád áprāṇan nimiṣác ca yád bhúvat

tád dādhāra pr̥thivī́ṃ viśvárūpaṃ tát saṃbhū́ya bhavaty ékam evá 11

Meaning: That (form of his) which moves (towards his devotees), that (form of his) which descends (patati) to a level so low that is easily accessible for his devotees,that which is also dependent (on his devotees), that which breathes (ie, lives by the services of his devotees), and does not breath (exist) without the devotees (aprAnan), he who exists with closed eyes, ie, devoid of grace (towards the enemies of his devotees). That (form of) Brahman protects by supporting the (baddhas residing in) samsAra mandalam (prthivIm) by his form which is full with all auspicious attributes (viSvarUpam), that despite becoming connected with a body is alone the unique One, matchless in all respects.

This mantra gives the answer to the previous mantra. The greatness of the archa avatAra is described here. It is the form in temples.

This form is assumed only for the sake of his devotees, so it is said he moves towards them (in love) with that form. He, who is independent, unconquerable and not understood by the vedas, forsakes his lofty position and descends to a level whereby all his devotees can see him, unlike other forms which are only accessible to the liberated, or to the devas. In this form, he who is independent actually depends on his devotees for his existence as they feed him, bathe, dress him, etc.

He feels very grateful and truly “alive” only when he receives these services. He, despite his independence and supremacy, cannot exist in this form without these devotees, as he is helpless without them.

This archa form cannot be understood by the ignorant who may think he is made of prakrti and mock his devotees. Thus to these type of asurAs, he, in the archa form, exists as “nimiSa”, a name occurring in the sahasranAma - na Ikshate iti nimishah – his graceful eyes do not fall on those opposed to his devotees.

His helplessness does not mean he has reduced his greatness in anyway. It is not helplessness brought on by karma or inadequacy, but by his own supreme will to mingle with his devotees. This is reiterated by the mantra saying that the very form of sriman nArAyaNa in temples and houses is the supporter of all those in samsAra, since they cannot exist without partaking of his form characterised by auspicious attributes, signified by “viSvarUpam”.

Though he assumes a body for the sake of his devotees and descends to samsAra, he is still “ekaH” – the supreme Brahman whose svarUpa-rUpa-guNa-vibhUti are matchless and unrivalled, being aprAkrta in nature. “eva” is to emphasize he alone always remains that way, unchanged, despite all the attributes he exhibits in the archa avatAra form.

(Hope this convinces readers to develop more affinity to visiting temples rather than wasting time reading the purAnAs or the shAstra. We go through the shAstra on the blog as a necessity, not particularly because it’s desirable. tIrtha yAtra >>> shAstra always).

anantáṃ vítataṃ purutrā́nantám ántavac cā sámante

té nākapāláś carati vicinván vidvā́n bhūtám utá bhávyam asya 12

Meaning: The infinite (not limited by time, space or object), who is spread out or who covers or surrounds the three worlds as the inner controller (vitatam), and who is the protector of srI vaikunta (nAkapAlaH), moves about as the indweller (carati), separating in the form of various gross forms (vicinvan purutrA) the two entities that have the same paramAtma as the source or cause (samAntE) – the sentient self that is eternal or endless in existence (anantam) and the insentient prakrti which is has an end or is perishable (antavat), knowing (vidvAn) the past and future as well as the present (bhUtam uta bhavyam) of this Universe (asya)

The previous rk described his archa forms as helpless. This rk clarifies that despite his exhibition of helplessness , he is still supreme by nature. The quality that makes him supreme is his infiniteness.

Why does he have infinite forms? To delight his devotees. Why does he have infinite power? Again, to protect and satisfy the wishes of his devotees. Why does he have infinite wealth? To gift away all this wealth to his devotees. The kaushitaki Upanishad records the conversation between sriman nArAyaNa and the liberated jivA in srI vaikunta, where bhagavAn says, “whatever victory is mine, is yours”. So, his wealth too exists only for his devotees.

Since he pervades all, he knows all beings in the past, present and future. This also makes him our natural protector.

He is the one who divided the collective of bound selves and prakrti from subtle state into gross forms. These two entities are his body and he is the inner controller. As such, he knows them all.

prajā́patiś carati gárbhe antár ádr̥śyamāno bahudhā́ ví jāyate

ardhéna víśvaṃ bhúvanaṃ jajā́na yád asyārdháṃ katamáḥ sá ketúḥ 13

Meaning: Sriman nArAyaNa, the lord of all entities sentient and insentient, moves within the cave of the hearts of all as the inner controller. Whose auspicious form is of the nature of being unperceivable by sense organs like the eye and others, he is born many-wise on account of his divine will. By one part (he is) fully connected with the worlds that are born (as inseparable attributes). Where is the other part of his (puruSa), which is foremost and of bright appearance?

This is a variant of the puruSa sUkta rk and fits nicely in the context of the previous mantras. BhagavAn is prajApati as he is the lord of all. The rk “ajAyamAno bahudha vijAyatE” appears in a modified form here as “adrsyamAno bahudha vijAyatE”.

“adrsyamAno” – his form is of the nature of not being grasped by sense organs. To this, a pUrvapakSa may be raised that it is fully possible to see his forms in the vibhava and archa states with the eyes, but this is dispelled by saying that while the auspicious form is visible in vibhava and archAvatArAs, the aprAkrtatva or non material nature is not cognized by the sense organs.

The last part of the mantra occurred earlier in the sUkta (part 1) and was already explained. “ketu” refers to bright appearance of the nitya vibhUti.

ūrdhváṃ bhárantam udakáṃ kumbhénevodahāryàm

páśyanti sárve cákṣuṣā ná sárve mánasā viduḥ 14

Meaning: All perceive with eyes (pashyanti sarve cakShusA) but not all know him with their mind (na sarvE manasA viduH), that Being which rises (above all changes), bearing the Universe made of subtle elements designated as “water” (urdhvaM bharantam udakaM), like a water carrier carries a pot (kumbhena iva udahAryam).

That paramAtma who has assumed the forms in temples as well as the other forms can thus be seen by all, from the lowest being to the highest. However, not all understand or meditate on him as paramAtma and hence they mock his avatArAs or consider him as another living being (avajananti mam mudha ~ Gita)

Those who do mock him, do not realize that even in such avatArAs, he has risen above all changes, ie, he is unaffected by changes despite exhibiting such traits during his leelas.

He bears the Universe just as a water carrier bears a pot of water. Just as the water in the pot does not make contact with the water carrier, the changes happening in the Universe do not affect him despite him having the Universe as his body.

(Note: The above analogy is only intended to illustrate that Brahman is unaffected by the changes of the Universe, but it must not be stretched to mean he is not the material cause, since the example of clay becoming clay pots, etc is given elsewhere to highlight material causality as well. Brahman is the operative, efficient and material cause of the Universe).

dūré pūrṇéna vasati dūrá ūnéna hīyate

mahád yakṣáṃ bhúvanasya mádhye tásmai balíṃ rāṣṭrabhŕ̥to bharanti 15

Meaning: Far away (in srI vaikunta), with fullness of attributes (pUrnEna), he (paravAsudeva) dwells. He (vyUha) becomes detached from the distant (paravAsudevan) with less than the full gamut of attributes (Unena). To that great yakSa in the Orb of the Sun (Bhuvanasya Madhye), those who rule (ie, those who have controlled their mind/ego) bring offering (self-surrender).

This of course, refers to his forms which are contemplated by devotees. He is visible as paravAsudeva to nityas and muktas. He is visible in the vyUha forms to devas in the milky ocean. The upAsakas meditate on his beautiful form in the orb of the sun as “tasya yathA kapyAsam pundarIkam evam akshiNi” – he is pundarIkAksha.

This is similar to the famous “ambhasya pArE, bhuvanasya madhyE…” mantra in the mahAnArAyaNopanishad.

“balim” refers to offering. What is this offering? It is nothing but sharanAgati or self-surrender. “rAstrabhrtO” refers to those who have the attribute of ruling. What do they rule? Their mind or ego, which they have controlled to perform self-surrender.

Who do they surrender do? Not to petty devas, but only to sriman nArAyaNa who is “mahad yaksam” – “mahad” means great. “ya + kSa” – he is the great one who destroys that which moves, ie, he destroys the indrIyas and mind which move towards sense objects. Or, he destroys the movement in samsara.

yátaḥ sū́ryaḥ udéty ástaṃ yátra ca gáchati

tád evá manye 'háṃ jyeṣṭháṃ tád u nā́ty eti kíṃ caná 16

Meaning: That from which the Sun rises, that to which he goes to set, I consider that alone as Eldest.  Nobody can ever transgress him.

“jyESTha” – occurs in the sahasranAma. He is “vriddhatamO jyESTha” as he is older than even Brahma who created all beings. “tad eva manyE” – refers to mahAvisvAsam, an angam of prapatti. I consider him alone as the eldest and hence the supreme protector.

“TadunAtyeti kimcana” – No-one can transgress him, meaning, no-one can transcend that Supreme Brahman who is the inner self of all. This mantra occurs in a modified version in the katOpanishad.

This establishes that he alone is worthy of surrender.

yé arvā́ṅ mádhya utá vā purāṇáṃ védaṃ vidvā́ṃsam abhíto vádanti

ādityám evá té pári vadanti sárve agníṃ dvitī́yaṃ trivŕ̥taṃ ca haṃsám 17

Meaning: They (the wise) say that the One with great knowledge (vidvansam) is near to those who are low (baddhas), in between (muktas) and ancient (nityas). In consequence of this,they all say that sriman nArAyaNa known as “Aditya” indeed (is) furnished with fire and is also the three-foldsun (hamsa).

“vidvAmsam” – BhagavAn is omniscient and acutely intelligent in the sense that he knows our sufferings very well and wishes to remove them. Hence, by virtue of his accessibility or sousIlyam/soulabhyam, he is very near to all irrespective of whether they are baddhas, muktas or nityas and hence is capable of protecting them.

Therefore, the wise say that he is indeed Aditya - "A" varNAt Atah ityah prApyah iti Adityah – He who is realised by the “AkAra” is Aditya according to srI parAshara bhattar in the sahasranAma. The “AkAra” is the bIja mantra for SankarshaNa, who possesses the guNams of jnAnam and balam to remove the distress of the jivAs and lead them out of samsAra.

“agnim dvitIyam” – “dvitIyam” means furnished with or possessing. “agni” or fire refers to the quality of accepting all offerings. Thus, this means he has the ability to be the means to liberation.

He is also the three-fold hamsa. Here, “hamsa” refers to the sun. The Upanishad declares that in the flame in the Aditya Mandala are the three purushas of the form of the rk, yajus and saman. In the form of these three, the vidya of the three vedas is shining out.  The mandala of the three vedas in the sun is witnessed by yOgIns as having a beautiful form and that is to be meditated upon.

sahasrāhṇyáṃ víyatāv asya pakṣáu hárer haṃsásya pátataḥ svargám

sá devā́nt sárvān úrasy upadádya saṃpáśyan yāti bhúvanāni víśvā 18

Meaning:Of (the nature or associated with the quality of) taking away the puNya and pApa karmas (hari), the two parts or wings, ie, jnAna and vairAgya or sama and dhama (pakSau) of the sun-like jIvAtma (hamsasya), extendedin knowledge (viyatau), soars over (conquers) theshining abode (paramapada) of infinite daily courses (of the sun), ie, infinite time.He (the jIvAtma), having taken upon oneself or assuming all the “devas” or the divine qualities(sarvAn devAn), stemming from his own self or essential nature (urasi), recognizing (his essential nature), attains all the worlds (bhuvanAni vishvA yAti).

The previous rk described that Brahman is the means to liberation. This rk therefore describes those mumukkshus who know this tattva. The jIvAtma who knows this truth, is said to have two wings which represent the quality of “sama” and “dhama”. Or it could mean the qualities of “jnAna” and “vairAgya”. Swami pillai lokAchArya states “Atma gunangalil pradhAnam samamum dhamamum” in his srI vachana bhUshana.

These two qualities which are metaphorically described as “wings” are capable of taking away the puNya and pApa karmas of the jIvAtma, whose dharma-bhUta-jnAna or attributive knowledge is extended. Thus, these qualities are said to conquer or achieve paramapAda.

“hamsa” – refers to the jIvAtma that is luminous as the sun in its essential nature.

“sahasrAhnyam” –  “ahnyam” means day or daily course, which should be taken as that of the sun. “sahasra” means thousand implying that it is infinite. So, “infinite daily courses of the sun” is the meaning. As the course of the sun is the measure of time, this refers to time which is infinite (sahasra).

“svarga” refers to paramapada. Therefore, “sahasrAhnyam svargam” refers to the supreme abode where time is infinite, as it has no sway. The jnAni conquers this supreme abode by his qualities of sama and dhama.

Such a jnAni, assumes or manifests the divine qualities described in the gita as “daivi sampath” and referred to as “devas” here, which stem from his essential nature. “urasi” cannot  mean “chest” here, but means that these qualities arise from his own self, ie, his essential nature.

He then recognizes this essential nature of seshatva or subservience to Brahman and thus attains liberation.

“yAti bhuvanAni visvA” – He attains all the worlds. In other words, upon liberation, he has free movement in all the worlds. Or it can be said that he attains paramapada which is often described as “worlds” in plural as it is infinite.

satyénordhvás tapati bráhmaṇārvā́ṅ ví paśyati

prāṇéna tiryáṅ prā́ṇati yásmin jyeṣṭhám ádhi śritám 19

Meaning: He (the individual self) shines upwards by truth. He perceives the lower (prakrti) with the Vedas (brahman). He breathes apart from (prakrti)by the Lord who is known as “prANa” as he is the life-breath of his devotees. He does this at a place where (yasmin) the eldest (jyESHtam) is approached or sought (adhishritam) as refuge.

This describes the qualities of the liberated jIvAtma. The practice of “satyam” (sAmAnyadharma or lokahitavachanam) is necessary on the part of a jnAni. Such a jnAni perceives the objects of enjoyment in prakrti, which are lower puruShArthas, with the aid of the Vedas, meaning, he feels dispassion for such enjoyment.

At the same time, he “breathes” or sustains himself apart from or detached from these sense objects, with bhagavAn alone who is his life-breath.

Such a state is attained in an uninterrupted manner only in the supreme abode where all muktas and nityas surrender to bhagavAn and consider him alone as the refuge to the exclusion of everything else.

sriman nArAyaNa is denoted as “jyEshTha” - One who created Brahma, hence is older than even Brahma and therefore is the eldest (as Bhattar comments on this nAma in the sahasranAma). This establishes his Ishvaratvam.

Pillai Lokacharya says “Isvaranai Ozhindavargal Rakshakar alla” – Other than Isvara, none can protect. By saying “jyESTha”, the Veda established that BhagavAn is superior to even Brahma (the oldest and lord of all creatures as prajApati), which establishes his Isvaratvam. By saying “adhisritam”, the Veda establishes that those performing self-surrender do so only to this bhagavAn who is Isvara, as he alone can protect.

yó vái té vidyā́d aráṇī yā́bhyāṃ nirmathyáte vásu

sá vidvā́n jyeṣṭháṃ manyeta sá vidyād brā́hmaṇaṃ mahát 20

Meaning: The wise yogin who knows those kindling sticks (Atman and praNava) by the churning of which, paramAtma known as “vasu” is drawn, will consider that as the Eldest (higher than Brahma), will know (by meditation) that great instructor of the vedas.

The first part of this mantra is a modification of the 1-13 mantra from SvetasvatAra Upanishad. The two kindling sticks to be known are the Atma and praNava.

The analogy of the churning is explained thus – How can we know that paramAtma is the indweller of the jivA as he cannot be directly perceived? The answer is this - Just as fire in the kindling sticks is not directly perceived, but upon churning of the kindling sticks, smoke arises and from that it is established that fire was in it even before, similarly,  bhagavAn, who is not directly perceived as residing in the Atman will be grasped when the Atman is churned with the praNava. Thus, it proves the eternal existence of paramAtma in the jivAtma as the indweller with the latter as his body.

“vasu” – This name occurs three times in the sahasranAma. In this context, bhagavAn is called “vasu” as he is the wealth sought by those who have realised the truth (vAsudevam sarvam idam) or because he dwells in the heart of his devotees upon the slightest indication of devotion.

The wise yogin will accept only that indweller – eSha sarvAntarAtma divyO deva eko nArAyaNa: - and no other – as the eldest (older than brahma and hence the supreme protector) and will meditate accordingly on that paramAtma as the great instructor of the vedas. This also echoes the tattvam of sharanAgati – that the supreme Isvara, sriman nArAyaNa, alone protects and must be resorted to. The wise will not resort to lower devas.

That paramAtma sriman nArAyaNa is the great instructor of the vedas and he is to be surrendered to is also reteirated in the svetAsvatAra, in the form of a beautiful prayer to srI hayagrIva who gifted the vedas to Brahma:

yo brahmANam vidadhAti pUrvam yo vai vedAmSca prahiNoti tasmai | tam ha devam Atma-buddhi prakASam mumukshurvai SaraNam aham prapadye || (~ Sve.Up 6.18)

Meaning: I, an aspirant after liberation, seek refuge in (surrender to), that effulgent God (sriman nArAyaNa) who creates Brahma first (at the time of creation) and who endows him with the vedas also and on account of whom the intellect of mine shines out.

apā́d ágre sám abhavat só ágre svàr ā́bharat

cátuṣpād bhūtvā́ bhógyaḥ sárvam ā́datta bhójanam 21

Meaning: The partless (Omkara) appeared in the beginning, that which is the chief (paravAsudeva who is One without a Second) bears the supreme abode (svarAbharat).  Having become comprised of 4 parts, he (paramAtma who has the jivAtma as his body) accepted everything that is to be enjoyed as food.

This mantra has to do with the 4 parts of the Omkara which are related to Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshana and Vasudeva who in turn are related to the states of vaisvAnara, taijasa, prajna and tUriya. This is elaborated in the Mandukya Upanishad.

Brahma dhRshti should be made in the pada chatushtaya of OmkAra. As per “Om ityEkAksharam”, the form of Brahman is visualised in the partless OmkAra. All the Universe of sentients and insentients  and all things either limited by time or not limited by time are verily OmkAra alone.

So, the first part of this mantra talks about the partless OmkAra. This means that OmkAra as vyUha vAsudeva  is to be meditated upon as paravAsudeva alone through samastha praNava rUpa – the full form of praNava as vyUha vAsudEva is very close to paravAsudEva.

Hence, the mantra uses the first  “agre” to denote in the beginning that OmkAra or paravAsudeva alone existed undifferentiated, and the second “agre” shows paravAsudeva as chief of the vyUhAs. He bears the supreme abode.

Some acharyas say there are 3 vyUhAs and others say there are 4 vyUhAs. If 3 vyUhas are taken, the first part of this mantra is referring to paravAsudeva. If 4 vyUhAs are taken, the mantra is referring to vyUhavAsudeva. As it is already established that vyUha vAsudeva is very close to paravAsudeva, the difference is insignificant. The fact that it is said “he bears the supreme abode” seems to favor the 3 vyuhAs viewpoint.

Now, coming to the second half of the mantra. The Omkara has 4 parts – Akara, Ukara, Makara and Ardhamathratmaka – and one should have the view that the 4 parts of praNava correspond to the 4 aspects of Parabrahman – Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshana and Vasudeva which in turn correspond to the 4 states - vaisvAnara, taijasa, prajna and tUriya.

So, the second part of the mantra beginning with “catuspAd bhUtva bhOgya…” means the  following - the jivAtma, which is closely associated with Brahman of the form of OmkAra, which in turn has become the 4 parts and hence (the jivA is) closely associated with the 4 vyUhAs – aniruddha, pradyumna, sankarshana and vAsudeva constituting the akara, ukara, makara and ardhamathratmaka – sees all objects of enjoyment in the 4 states of vaisvAnara, taijasa, prajna and tUriya as food, ie, experiences the objects of enjoyment by the grace of paramAtma.

This explains the mantra. Simply put, it deals with how bhagavAn presides over the 4 states of the mAndUkya in the 4 vyUha forms corresponding to the 4 parts of the praNava and how the jivAtma, which is closely associated with bhagavAn who is the indweller, experiences the objects of enjoyment in the 4 states by the grace of paramAtma.

The jivAtma is the body of Brahman – this is the close association mentioned earlier. So, when the mantra says “He accepted everything to be enjoyed as food”, it employs sAmAnAdhikaraNyam and only means “paramAtma which has the jivAtma as its body, accepted (via the jivA which is its body) the objects of enjoyment to be experienced in the 4 states”. It is the jivA who experiences, with paramAtma as its indweller.

bhógyo bhavad átho ánnam adad bahú

yó devám uttarā́vantam upā́sātai sanātánam 22

Meaning: He who incessantly meditates on the One who sports with the jivAs (Deva), who is the most ancient (sanAtanam) and who possesses the excellent auspicious attributes (uttaravantam),  becomes the enjoyed (as he offers services) and then eats food in abundance (in the form of experience of Brahman).  

“sanAtanam” – This name occurs in the sahasranAma as “sanAtana-tamah”. One meaning is that he is the most ancient as he existed before the jivAs, even before pralaya. This shows he alone is Isvara as he is prior to all. Remember that Gajendra called paramAtma first and foremost as “Adi MoolamE” for protection.

“deva” – occurs in the sahasranAma again (udbhavah kshobano devah). dIvyati krIDati iti devah – He sports with the jivAs and binds them with prakrti known as mAya. Thus, he is the MahEswara who rules over mAya and must alone be resorted to. KrishNa reiterates this in the Gita by saying - [mam](http://vedabase.net/m/mam)[eva](http://vedabase.net/e/eva)[ye](http://vedabase.net/y/ye)[prapadyante](http://vedabase.net/p/prapadyante)[mayam](http://vedabase.net/m/mayam)[etam](http://vedabase.net/e/etam)[taranti](http://vedabase.net/t/taranti)[te](http://vedabase.net/t/te).

“uttaravantam” – he possesses the most superior and excellent auspicious attibutes that are worthy of being meditated upon.

The jivAtma who surrenders to sriman nArAyaNa by meditating on these qualities of bhagavAn, is termed as the bhOgyam or enjoyed because he becomes food for the paramAtma. The taittriya Upanishad also says “ahaM annam…”. He offers services at all places, all times and in all states to bhagavAn who accepts it. Thus, he is food for bhagavAn.

The jivAtma is then termed as one who eats food. After offering services, he sees paramAtma accept that service with a smile (padiyAy kidanthu un pavalavAy kAnbene – perumAl thirumozhi) and joy wells up in him. Service thus leads to experience of paramAtma’s divine qualities, and since the jivA enjoys these auspicious attributes which are in abundance (hence, paramAtma is known as “bhUma” in the Upanishads), he (the jivA) is called as one who eats food in the form of experience of Brahman.

sanātánam enam āhur utā́dyá syāt púnarṇavaḥ

ahorātré prá jāyete anyó anyásya rūpáyoḥ 23

Meaning: They call this (paramAtma) as “sanAtanam” or one who is associated with an eternal body (who) becomes new every moment. The other different from this paramAtma, ie, the jivA, manifests forms different from this (prakrti) (like) day and night.

“They” refer to the wise AchAryAs.

“sanAtanam” – We again refer to Bhattar’s commentary on “sanAtana tamah” in the sahasranAma. Bhattar indicates the term 'tana' in the nAma to refer to his auspicious form(tanu - SarIram) - sadA-tanatve'pi tadA-tanatvavat nitya nUtana bhogyaH – Even though bhagavAn has always had a body (sadA tanatvam), He looks like One who is just new (tadA-tanattvam) - One who has just been endowed with a new body),and is enjoyed as though He is new, and this is why He is sanA-tana- tamaH. This explanation suits the context.

BhagavAn is 'purA api navaH - purANaH' in that he is ageless, but new in the sense that as you keep enjoying his auspicious qualities, more and more new qualities arise to be enjoyed, thus bhagavAn appears new each time and the enjoyment is endless.

“ahorAtrE prajAyatE anyo anyasya rUpayoH” – The jivAs who are different or other (anya) than the paramAtma manifest multiple forms in samsAra. The difference between the bodies of the jIvas in prakrti/samsAra and the body assumed by paramAtmA is as stark as the difference between day and night. One is impure, the other is pure. One is made of triguNas, the other made of suddha sattva. One is assumed due to karma, the other is assumed due to will, and so on.

By saying “anya”, the difference between jivA and paramAtma is established.

śatáṃ sahásram ayútaṃ nyàrbudam asaṃkhyeyáṃ svám asmin níviṣṭam

tád asya ghnanty abhipáśyata evá tásmād devó rocata eṣá etát 24

Meaning: A hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred million, innumerable (auspicious attributes) by nature is his (paramAtma’s) wealth, established (niviShTam) in this (eternal form). They (the auspicious attributes) destroy that (sin) which belongs to the jIvAtma (asya) even as he perceives, ie, meditates on (abhupashyataH) paramAtma. On account of that (tasmAt), this one, the jIvAtma (eShaH) who is designated as “deva”, becomes agreeable or radiant.

The previous rk talked about paramAtma possessing an eternal body. The first part of the mantra refers to innumerable auspicious qualities, which stem from the essential nature of the paramAtma, which can be meditated upon in that eternal form. Such meditation of the form of direct perception destroys the karmas of the jIvAtma, which can be referred to in the singular.

“rocata” – Since karma is destroyed, the contracted attributive knowledge, known as dharma bhUta jnAna, is expanded infinitely and thus the jivAtma shines luminously due to extended knowledge which blossoms out like rays from the sun. Thus, he is radiant. Alternatively, “rocata” can mean that the jIvAtma now becomes pleasing to paramAtma, or agreeable to his own true nature of seshatva.

bā́lād ékam aṇīyaskám utáikaṃ néva dr̥śyate

tátaḥ páriṣvajīyasī devátā sā́ máma priyā́ 25

Meaning: One (the jivAtma) is subtler than a hair and One (the paramAtma) is not even perceived (by the senses).  Therefore, that effulgent God who embraces (the jivA during the state of deep sleep) is dear to me (I hold that as the highest object of attainment).

In the Gita, Arjuna asks a question as to who reaches their goal faster – those who meditate on the jivAtma or those who meditate on paramAtma. That question is answered here.

The jivAtma is subtler than a hair and hence the essential nature of the self is very difficult to be perceived or experienced. Thus, jnAna yOga or meditation on the jivAtma is not only difficult, but also results in delay in achieving the goal.

In the case of paramAtma, he is not perceivable to the senses. However, the BrihadAraNyaka Upanishad (4.3.21) states that during suShupti, the jivAtma is free from all desires, being unaware of all objects internal and external as he is in the close embrace of the omniscient paramAtma. Just who as a person is embraced by his wife is oblivious to anything else, similarly, the embrace of the paramAtma occurs in the suShupti state when the jivA is oblivious to all other objects, is bereft of sorrow and has no desire for anything other than the AtmAn.

That effulgent god, who is luminous on account of the radiance of srI mahAlakshmi on his chest, who possesses vAtsalya guNa or affection for the jivA, who embraces the jivA in the state of suShupti fondly, is considered as the highest object of attainment by the jivAtma. He is attained very easily as well.

iyáṃ kalyāṇy àjárā mártyasyāmŕ̥tā gr̥hé

yásmai kr̥tā́ śáye sá yáś cakā́ra jajā́ra sáḥ 26

Meaning: He (paramAtma), for whom everything is accomplished (kritA), this sentient, auspicious one free from old age and death, resides in the abode (body) of the one subject to death (jIvAtma). He is the one who (in the remote past) created, ie, was the Cause and became old or the ancient, worthy of worship (jajAra).

This mantra shows that paramAtma, who is self-satisfied, free of karma, blemish, etc, nonetheless resides as the antaryAmin of the bound self subject to birth and death by his own will. This antaryAmin, who is the effect (has the effects as his body), is non-different to the paramAtma who is the cause (when he had the subtle Universe as his body).

In other words, the cause is non-different from the effect because the effects are different states of the cause. “neha nAnAsti kincana” – paramAtma does not have any diversity and does not undergo change even if he becomes antaryAmin of the bound self.

tváṃ strī́ tváṃ púmān asi tváṃ kumārá utá vā kumārī́

tváṃ jīrṇó daṇḍéna vañcasi tváṃ jātó bhavasi viśvátomukhaḥ 27

Meaning: You are the woman. You are the man, you are the boy and you are verily the girl. Becoming old, you move with the support of the staff. You alone become born in all kinds of form.

Having established the difference between the individual self and the body, this mantra now addresses that Supreme Brahman. The fact of Brahman being the self of all is described here.

You assume all forms and become all – “tvam sarvarUpo jAthOsi”. Therefore, everything is his vibhUti as he is existing in all entities pervading them as their AtmAn. The connotation of each term like “woman”, “man” etc extends upto the inmost self and all terms signify that supreme paramAtma who is sarvAntarAtma, the self of all entities.

This beautiful mantra occurs in the svetAsvatAra Upanishad and this is the commentary of srI ranga rAmAnuja muni.

utáiṣāṃ pitótá vā putrá eṣām utáiṣāṃ jyeṣṭhá utá vā kaniṣṭháḥ

éko ha devó mánasi práviṣṭaḥ prathamó jātáḥ sá u gárbhe antáḥ 28

Meaning: (That Brahman is) even as the father of these, even as the son of these, even as the eldest, or even the youngest. The effulgent god has entered the mind (ie, is known through meditation), who manifested himself even prior to the origination of the devas, within the cave of the heart as the inner controller.

The first part of the mantra continues the vibhUti yOga of the previous mantra.

“deva” – The effulgent Lord of Sri as mentioned earlier. It signifies his vAtsalya guNa or affection caused by association with Sri as well (sraddhAya devO devatvam asnutE – he becomes a deva or one full of auspicious attributes due to association with SrI).

“manasi pravisthah” – He is to be known through the intellect via meditation.

“prathamO jAtah” – Here, “jAtah” refers to the devas beginning with Brahma. He manifested himself prior to even these gods. This echoes the puruSa sUkta rk “pUrvo yo devebhya jAta:”

“garbhE antaH” – He resides in the cave of the heart as the inner controller.

pūrṇā́t pūrṇám úd acati pūrṇáṃ pūrṇéna sicyate

utó tád adyá vidyāma yátas tát pariṣicyáte 29

Meaning: From pUrNa (para-vAsudeva), the pUrNa (vyUha) rises up. By pUrNa (the vyUha), the pUrNa (the vibhava/antaryAmi/archa) is poured out. We should know it today, that (Brahman) from which it (the manifestations of Brahman) is poured out.

The meaning should be clear. In some AgamAs, antaryAmi and archa are clubbed together with vibhava so that we have only 3 manifestations instead of 5 – para, vyUha and vibhava. That line of thinking is likely seen here.

eṣā́ sanátnī sánam evá jātáiṣā́ purāṇī́ pári sárvaṃ babhūva

mahī́ devy ùṣáso vibhātī́ sáikenaikena miṣatā́ ví caṣṭe 30

Meaning: This one, bhU dEvI (eShA), who guides the worshippers (sanatnI), was indeed born to be long lasting or enduring (in patience). She who is the basis of paramAtma designated as “purANA” (purANI), surpassed everything, ie, conquered all (pari sarvam babhUva). The great devi, or bhU devi, is resplendent due to dawn, ie, knowledge (uShas). She perceives the needs of living beings clearly (vicastE), one at a time, ie, very attentively (ekenaikena), with her (compassionate) eyes (miSatA).

After describing the forms of paramAtma in the form of OmkArA, this mantra describes bhumi devi, who possesses the quality of mediation. As she is the Earth Goddess, she is exalted in the Upanishads as well along with paramAtma.

She is born to endure as she, as Earth, bears all. She is known as “hrI” for her forbearance. Thus, she is patience personified. She is dear to paramAtma and hence is “purANI” or the basis of paramAtma known as “purANa” (as he is ancient but appears ever new).

“purANI” means the controller of basis of “purANA” – meaning, he cannot sustain himself without her company. srI Vedanta desikan in his bhU stuti states that bhagavAn gets his nourishment by his association with bhU devi and becomes empowered to perform his duties as described in the vedas.

As even paramAtma is obedient to her command, and due to her own great qualities, she has surpassed everything. She is radiant because of her knowledge of paramAtma which is designated as “dawn”.

She listens attentively to the pleas of the jIvAs and looks at them with her eyes of compassion.

ávir vái nā́ma devátā́ rténāste párīvr̥tā

tásyā rūpéṇemé vr̥kṣā́ háritā háritasrajaḥ 31

Meaning: The devatA (srI devi), known as “well-disposed to all” is seated along with that all-pervading paramAtma (rta) and is full of auspicious attributes (parivRita). Due to her nature of acting as puruSakAra or mediator (tasyAH rUpENa), these beings designated as “vRkshA”, are golden, ie, desirable for paramAtma (haritA), become adorned in golden garlands, ie, their desires are fulfilled (haritasrajah)

After waxing eloquent on bhU devi, this rk now describes srI devi. Together, these two rks explain the puruSha sUkta rk – “hrIsca tE lakshmisca patnyou”. Just as in the puruSha sUkta, even the order is the same – bhU devi (hri) was described first and now srI devi (lakshmi) is described here.

The upabrahmaNa for this rk is as follows:

vaikuNThe tu pare loke shriyA sArddhaM jagatpatiH | Aste viShNuracintyAtmA bhaktaiH bhAgavataiH saha

She is seated along with paramAtma in srI vaikunta .

“rtEna asti” – paramAtma is “Rta”, which means means “sarvagath” (rtam satyam param brahma). He pervades all jivAs for two reasons: 1) He wants to be close to the jivAs to bestow his grace out of affecton, 2) without his pervasion, the jivAs would not exist as entities. Both these qualities signified by pervasion are due to srI mahAlakshmi’s grace.

“parivRta” could mean she is full of kalyAna guNas (auspicious attributes) that favour the jivAs. It could also mean she is “surrounded” by nityas and muktas in sri vaikunta.

“tasyAH rUpENa” – “rUpa” here means her nature and not her form. She has the nature of being the mediator for jIvAs.

The brihadAraNyaka Upanishad designates all beings as “vRksha”. So this term denotes all beings of the world, who resort to her for mediation.

“harita” or golden refers to desire; it is in plural since there are many jivAs in the world with many desires. By her nature of mediation and acting in favour of the jivAs, she ensures the grace of paramAtma on the latter. Thus, these jIvAs become “golden” (agreeable or desirable) for paramAtma, upon which paramAtma showers his grace on these jIvAs by fulfilling their desires, which is metaphorically again described as wearing “golden” garlands, ie, their desires are satisfied.

ánti sántaṃ ná jahāty ánti sántaṃ ná paśyati

devásya paśya kā́vyaṃ ná mamāra ná jīryati 32

Meaning: Existing in the proximity of (the jivAtma), He (paramAtma) does not forsake that (jivAtma), Existing within the proximity of (matter), he (the jivAtma) does not see (that paramAtma). Behold the Omniscience of the effulgent Lord of Sri (devasya), who is not subject to death (mamAra) and who does not grow old, ie, satisfied (jIryati).

This is similar to the “dvA suparNa” mantra. ParamAtma is very close to the jivAtma by virtue of being the inner self. And as mentioned in the previous mantra, he who is the indweller, by virtue of his affection and other kalyAna guNas, never forsakes the jivAs. He does this despite the fact that the jivAs are very close or connected with prakrti and hence do not see paramAtma who is their inner self.

Why does he do this? Because he is omniscient as he knows the sufferings of the jivAs and what they desire. “kavim” occurs in the nArAyaNa sUkta and means omniscient, same as “kAvyam” here.

Why is he omniscient in this manner? Because he is “deva” as he has the association of the effulgent SrI, because he is not subject to death (and hence, births) like the jivA and hence does not have contracted knowledge. And also because he never grows satisified with what he has – in other words, no matter how many jivAs get liberated, he is not satisfied and wants to liberate all jivAs, not forsaking the ones still unliberated. Also, even after giving the jivAs bodies, giving them the means to attain him, providing them with enjoyment both in this world and in paramapada, he is still not satisfied; he wants to bestow more favour on the jivAs. “Never grows old” is a metaphor for not being satisfied.

All this is again, due to his association with srI devI.

apūrvéṇeṣitā́ vā́cas tā́ vadanti yathāyathám

vádantīr yátra gáchanti tád āhur brā́hmaṇaṃ mahát 33

Meaning: The apAuruSheya Vedas which have no prior cause (apUrvanESita vAcas) say what is proper (to each). Where the Vedas which speak (of many things) go (ie, are directed towards), that (which) they say is the great instructor of the Veda.

“apUrvRnESita vAcas” – refers to the apAuruSeya Vedas. They have no prior cause or origin and are eternal and thus flawless.

“vadanti yathAyatham” – This means that the Vedas deal with various subjects and speak about different puruSarthas (higher and lower) for different kinds of people, as is proper for them based on their dispositions and proportions of triguNas. Gita also says “triguNya vishaya veda..”.

However, the same Vedas which speak of many things identify only one goal as the highest object of attainment and indeed, the different things the Vedas speak about are intended to gradually lead a person to that goal. That object of attainment is none other than the Supreme Brahman, the Lord nArAyaNa, who is the benevolent instructor of the Vedas. He gave the Vedas to Brahma and to all beings to enable them to understand and attain him, by a gradual process.

The name “brAhmaNah” in the sahasranAma is interpreted as “instructor of the Vedas” by Bhattar. “mahaT” signifies greatness in the mantra. He is great in the sense that all objects of enjoyment are contained in him and he is the highest object of attainment, the supreme goal that the Vedas go towards.

yátra devā́ś ca manuṣyā̀ś cārā́ nā́bhāv iva śritā́ḥ

apā́ṃ tvā púṣpaṃ pr̥chāmi yátra tán māyáyā hitám 34

Meaning: Wherein the devas (nitya sUrIs) and also manuShyas (those who meditate; the bound selves) are fixed as spokes (of a wheel) on the hub, I ask you, who (karmas) foster the drinking or experience of pain and pleasure (puShpa) associated with the subtle elements designated as “waters”, where was it (the bound self) fixed in (hitaM) by prakrti known as “mAyA”? 

“devAh” refers to the nitya sUrIs. “manuShya” is a general term referring to all bound selves in the Universe. They are both inseparable attributes of Brahman and dependent on him.

“apAm” refers to waters which in turn connote the subtle elements. “pushpa” – root push- refers to “augment”, “pa” – drinking, which is experience of pain and pleasure. It is the karmas who cause the experience of pain and pleasure.

The bound self experiencing pain and pleasure as a result of karmas, is stationed in the condition of identifying itself with the body (ahaM buddhi) by prakrti which deludes and thus he forgets his true nature of subservience to Brahman. This prakrti which has the 3 guNas as it’s constituents  is called “mAyA” because it is the cause of varied and wonderful creation.

yébhir vā́ta iṣitáḥ pravā́ti yé dádante páñca díśaḥ sadhrī́cīḥ

yá ā́hutim atyámanyanta devā́ apā́ṃ netā́raḥ katamé tá āsan 35

Meaning: Who (karma-vAsaNas) cause the jivAtma signified by “wind” to blow (ie, move ceaselessly in samsAra)? Who (attachments) impel the five quarters (ie, the sense organs) to be directed (to the experience of sense objects)? Who are the ones (desires) who excessively regard (atyamanyata) the offering (pain and pleasure)? Who are the directors, ie, objects of enjoyment (netAraH) of the bound self that is associated with the subtle elements designated as “waters” (apAm), of what nature ie, made of three guNas (katame) were they (te Asan)?  

“vAtaH iSitaH pravAti” – The karma-vAsaNas cause the jivA to move ceaselessly like wind in samsAra.

“dadantE panca diSa sadhrIcIh” – The five quarters refer to the 5 sense organs.  The attachments stemming from karma-vAsaNas direct these sense organs to the experience of sense objects

The karma-vAsaNas cause movement in samsAra. Upon assuming gross forms, these attachments lead the senses to the experience of sense objects. The desires of the jIvAtma, stemming from attachments, “excessively regard” or cause experience of pain and pleasure, which is the offering. The objects of enjoyment which are the source of pain and pleasure and which are of the nature of the three guNas of prakrti thus direct the bound self in samsAra.

imā́m eṣāṃ pr̥thivī́ṃ vásta éko 'ntárikṣaṃ páry éko babhūva

dívam eṣāṃ dadate yó vidhartā́ víśvā ā́śāḥ práti rakṣanty éke 36

Meaning: Of these (entities described above), this One (the self) resides in prithvi or the body, One (the intellect) fully (controls or directs) the intermediate which is the mind (antarIksha), One (the mind) who grants to (the bound self) the shining abode (signifying the objects of desire), is the supporter (of the senses). Many who are incomparable or best of their kind (the objects of desire), protect all desires (existing).

“eko antarIkSam pari” – The mind is signified as “antarIksha” as it is the intermediate that channels the intellect. It is fully controlled by the intellect as the latter is higher than the mind.

“divam” – objects of desire which shine out to the bound self by the mind, which supports the senses. These objects of desire exist for experience and hence are said to protect all desires.

yó vidyā́t sū́traṃ vítataṃ yásminn ótāḥ prajā́ imā́ḥ

sū́traṃ sū́trasya yó vidyā́d sá vidyād brā́hmaṇaṃ mahát 37

Meaning: He who knows that thread (vAyu) by which all beings are strung together, he who knows the thread’s thread, ie, the inner controller of vAyu and all beings, he knows the great instructor of the veda.

This mantra has the same meaning as the dialogue between YajnavAlkya and other rishis in the trutIya adhyAya, saptama brAhmaNa of the BrihadArAnyaka Upanishad. In the mantra 3-7-6, YajnavAlkya clarifies that the thread is actually vAyu and that this world and all beings are strung together by vAyu. YajnavAlkya gives the example of a dead person – the limbs of a dead person are loosened, while they were held together before by vAyu. At the time of death, vAyu does not support the limbs and so they become loosened.

The “thread’s thread” is nothing but the inner controller and this is clarified in the same section as the antaryAmin by YajnavAlkya. After describing vAyu, yajnavAlkya proceeds to talk about the inner controller of that vAyu, as well as all beings and worlds by declaring “yasya prithvi sarIram...yasya Atma sarIram”. All the worlds and beings are the body of the inner controller.

The person who knows this tattva is a knower of Brahman. The name “brAhmaNah” in the sahasranAma is interpreted as “instructor of the Vedas” by Bhattar as mentioned earlier. “mahaT” signifies greatness in the mantra. He is great in the sense that all objects of enjoyment are contained in him and he is the highest object of attainment, the supreme goal that the Vedas go towards.

védāháṃ sū́traṃ vítataṃ yásminn ótāḥ prajā́ imā́ḥ

sū́traṃ sū́trasyāháṃ vedā́tho yád brā́hmaṇaṃ mahád 38

Meaning: I know that thread (vAyu)  by which all beings are strung together,  I know  the thread’s thread, ie, the inner controller of vAyu and all beings, thus I know the great instructor of the veda.

This rk is a practical application of the previous rk. The previous rk clarified that this knowledge was essential for a seeker of truth. This rk now shows that the knowledge is not mere vAkyartha jnAna, but is of the form of meditation leading to direct perception. The words “vedAham” or “I know” must be taken as the mananam, sravanam and nidhidhyAsam which leads to brahma-sAkSAtkAratvam.

So, the purpose of this rk is to show that the upAsaka, after understanding the truth, must meditate on everything as the body of Brahman, who is the inner controller of all.

yád antarā́ dyā́vāpr̥thivī́ agnír áit pradáhan viśvadāvyàḥ

yátrā́tiṣṭhann ékapatnīḥ parástāt kvèvāsīn mātaríśvā tadā́nīm 39

Meaning: Inside which (embodied self), the fire (paramAtma as the inner controller) attains the head and the foot (dyAvaprithvi), while consuming (food) that is fit to be burnt or tormented in its’ entirety, wherein (that paramAtma) dwell the devoted consort, SrI mahAlakshmi (ekapatnI), beyond that state or condition (parastAt), where (kva) did that jIvAtma known as “mAtarishvan” exist, at that time during pralaya (tadAnIM)?

The nArAyaNa sUkta declares tasya madhye mahanagnirviśvārcirviśvatomukhaḥ, so'grabhug vibhajan tiṣṭhan āhāramajaraḥ kaviḥ

The Lord resides in the subtle opening of the heart whence the gastric fire blazing above enters. Hence, he is said to be residing in the gastric fire. He, the ever awake, the ever roaring, classifies the food and consumes it himself first. krishNa also says “ahaM vaiSvAnarO brutvA:” in the Gita.

“dvAvaprithvI” – The nArAyaNa sUkta says that he, as the inner controller of the gastric fire torments the body from the bottom of the foot to the head. Therefore, this term signifies “from top to bottom” of the body.

“ekapatnIh” – Though in plural, it can be interpreted in the singular as the wife who is solely devoted to her husband. This is a description of mahAlakshmi, who dwells on the body of the indwelling Lord, as described in the nArAyaNa sUktam as “nīlatoyadamadhyasthād vidyullekheva bhāsvarā”.

“matarIsvA” – means wind. This refers to the baddha jivAs who move ceaselessly in samsAra like wind.

The question posed here is, where did the jivAs in gross states, who currently have paramAtma as their inner self, exist prior to creation or during pralaya?

The next rk has the answer.

apsv ā̀sīn mātaríśvā práviṣṭaḥ práviṣṭā devā́ḥ salilā́ny āsan

br̥hán ha tasthau rájaso vimā́naḥ pávamāno haríta ā́ viveśa 40

Meaning: The jivAtma which moves ceaselessly like wind in samsAra, entered (into the state) of (association with) subtle state signified as “waters”. The senses signified by “devas” as they illumine objects, had entered into the subtle state signified as “waters”. The self associated with “rajas” or passion, devoid of a dwelling or gross body (rajaso vimAna) remained stationary (ie, in slumber) as (in likeness to) prakrti or insentient matter designated as “great” (brhAn).  The one that purifies, ie, paramAtma (pavamAna), entered the jIvAs associated with desire or passion (haritaH).

“mAtarisvA” refers to the jivA that moves ceaselessly like wind. This bound self, which is associated with a gross body, entered into the condition of association with a subtle body during pralaya.

The “devAs” refer to the five senses of knowledge and the five senses of action. It could mean the aggregate which is the body.

The term, “waters” denotes these subtle elements. So, “devAs entered into waters” indicate the transformation of the senses-aggregate gross forms (bodies) into the subtle state.

“rajaso vimAna” – vimAna means devoid of a dwelling or gross body. The self is still in samsAra, hence it is associated with the quality of passion. But as it is devoid of a gross body, it is unable to execute actions to fulfill its desires. Thus, it remains stationary, without movement in samsAra or in slumber.

In this state of slumber, the dharma-bhUta-jnAna or attributive knowledge is contracted to zero, so that the jIvAtma cannot perceive any external objects. Therefore, it is indistinguishable from insentient matter which also has no dharma-bhUta-jnAna. This insentient matter is prakrti which is great, hence referred to as “brhAn” here. By saying this self is stationary as matter, it means it looks indistinguishable from matter in slumber. The only difference, in this subtle state, between the self and matter is that the self still has the essential nature of “I”, which matter does not.

As the self cannot see external objects, paramAtma, called the purifier as he has maintained this subtle state to extricate the jIva from its attachments, is said to “enter” the jIva in the sense that the jIvA only knows paramAtma as its’ inner controller in this state.

The jIvas are called “haritaH” as they are still associated with subtle bodies and bound in samsAra by the quality of desire, which is designated as “yellow” or “golden”. Or, it could mean, these bound selves are as dear as gold to paramAtma, he loves them and hence they are referred like this.

úttareṇeva gayatrī́m amŕ̥té 'dhi ví cakrame

sā́mnā yé sā́ma saṃvidúr ajás tád dadr̥śe kvà 41

Meaning:  Indeed by his (paramAtma’s) quality of being the rescuer or the means (uttarEna iva), he rose to (vicakramE) the paramAtma by the name of “gAyatrI” in the supreme abode (amrita), upon death or exhaustion of karmas (adhi).  Those who know well (ye samviduH) the paramAtma that is appeasing (sAma), by virtue of (paramAtma) that destroys or brings to an end the samsAra (sAman), they know, ie, perceive the (abode) where the class of nitya sUrIs designated as “unborn” (ajaH) see (dadR^ishe) that “sAman”  or paramAtma who is appeasing (tat).

paramAtma is known as “Uttara” as he is the rescuer, signifying he is the means. By this quality of paramAtma, the jIvAs are liberated upon death and reach paramAtma in the supreme abode.

“gAyatri” refers to paramAtma as the former is described as “brahmasamhitam” – vAchyEna brahmaNA pujyatvEna samithaM samaM” – As Brahman is the vAchya or import of gAyatri, it signifies Brahman.

“sAma” – The word has two meanings according to Bhattar. “sAma” is derived from the root so-antaHkramaNi- which means to destroy or bring to an end. This signifies paramAtma who is the means as he brings an end to samsAra. The second meaning is “sAtibhyam manin maniNau”  - “that which is appeasing”. This again signifies paramAtma.

Thus, they attain that appeasing paramAtma known as “sAman” by virtue of paramAtma who brings an end to samsAra and hence is “sAman”.

“ajas tad dadRse kva” – These jIvAs who know paramAtma as the means and are liberated also perceive that supreme abode where the nitya sUrIs, who collectively belong to the class of “unborn” as they are eternally liberated, always see paramAtma (sadA pashyanti surayaH).

nivéśanaḥ saṃgámano vásūnāṃ devá iva savitā́ satyádharmā

índro ná tasthau samaré dhánānām 42

Meaning: The One (Supreme Brahman) who provides a resting place or shelter to the jIvAs (niveshanaH), who leads or directs the jIvAs (saMgamanaH), like Agni the Chief of Vasus (vasunAm devaH iva), who prompts or instigates the intellect of the jIvAs (savitA), who is the desired ultimate goal for all jIvAs OR the function of the jIvAs (satyadharmA), that all-pervading wealthy Lord (Indra) does not remain in (ie, is not affected by) the confluence or association (samarE), of the jIvAs and prakrti who are his wealth (dhana-s)

This should be self-explanatory as it describes the nature of the Supreme Brahman.

“vasunAm devaH iva” – The chief of vasus is Agni as confirmed by bhagavAn himself in the vibhUti yOga adhyAya of the Gita. Just as Agni directs or leads the vasus, he directs the jIvAs and leads them out of samsAra.

“savitA” – The Lord who prompts the intellect of the jIvAs.

“satyadharmA” – “satya” refers to the jivAtma according to the shruti statements like “satyam cAnrtam ca satyambhavat” and “satyasya satyam”. “dharmA” refers to the dharma-bhUta-jnAna, ie, the function of the jivAtma which is to behold Brahman. Thus, Brahman can be said to be the “dharmA” of the jIvA (satya). Alternatively, it means Brahman is the goal sought by all jIvAs (designated as satya). Both meanings are given by srI vedAnta desikan in the isavasya Upanishad.

“Indra” – Refers to the Lord who is wealthy by virtue of pervading everything in many different ways, as a result of which everything becomes his body, his property and hence his wealth. The root is idi - paramaiSvarye - to own great wealth.

Such an all-pervasive Lord, despite his pervasion of sentients and insentients which are his wealth, does not remain (na tasthau) in the association of the jIvAs and prakrti which are both his wealth (dhanu-s). That is to say, though he pervades the bound selves and prakrti as their inner controller, he does not get associated with prakrti like the jIvAs on account of karmas and is unaffected by the changes the individual selves and prakrti undergo.

Alternatively, it can mean that the all-pervasive Lord (Indra), despite associating himself with his wealth which are the jIvas and prakrti (as the indweller who has them as his body), is unaffected by such association. Either way, the meaning is the same.

puṇḍárīkaṃ návadvāraṃ tribhír guṇébhir ā́vr̥tam

tásmin yád yakṣám ātmanvát tád vái brahmavído viduḥ 43

Meaning: The Knowers of Brahman meditate on that Self, as having (Brahman) as its self, abiding in that lotus like abode which is the heart (within) the body which has nine gates, invested with the three kinds of guNas (sattva, rajas and tamas).

The meaning should be clear since the Gita verses and the Chandogya Upanishad section on dahara vidyA talk about the lotus like heart and the body which is like a city with nine gates. The three guNas are also mentioned here.

“yakSam” – refers to the individual self.

“Atmanvat” – refers to the self of the individual self, ie, paramAtma sriman nArAyaNa who is the indweller.

The knowers of Brahman (brahmaviduH) meditate (viduH) on the individual self within the lotus of the heart as having paramAtma as its indweller. This way, they realise that the individual self is subservient to, is the body of and pervaded by paramAtma. That is the meaning conveyed by this mantra.

akāmó dhī́ro amŕ̥taḥ svayaṃbhū́ rásena tr̥ptó ná kútaś canónaḥ

tám evá vidvā́n ná bibhāya mr̥tyór ātmā́naṃ dhī́ram ajáraṃ yúvānam 44

Meaning: (The individual self is) without desire (when free of karmas), unchanging (in its essential nature), immortal (as only the bodies are destroyed), the self-existent (as it was not created), contented with the bliss (of its essential nature), not inferior in any way in the sense of having no master other than Brahman (na kutashcana UnaH). The knower of that (indweller of the) Self which is firm (in blessing his devotees), not subject to old age (ie, is free from affliction of samsAra), ever-young (in appearance) or fresh (as his auspicious attributes appear newer and newer each time) is free from the fear of death (ie, samsAra).

OR

(That Brahman is) desireless, unchanging (ie, unaffected by samsAra), nectarine (ie, the abode of auspicious attributes), manifesting by his own will (as avatArAs in samsAra), contented in his own essence or nature, ie, self-established (rasena), not inferior anywhere in the sense that his pervasion in different forms and manifestations etc do not cause changes/diminishment to him (na kutashcana UnaH). The Knower of that Self is freed from the fear of samsAra signified by “death”, steadfast (in meditation on Brahman), not affected by old age (ie, free from afflictions of samsAra), always fresh (One whose study of the veda remains fresh on account of non-forgetfulness).

The sukta ends with a beautiful mantra. The uniqueness of this mantra is that it can be taken in two ways – 1) the first set of adjectives can signify the jivA and the second set can signify paramAtma or 2) vice-versa. I have provided both meanings.

“yuvAnam” – If taken as an epithet of paramAtma, it means he is ever-young in appearance or that he is always fresh – his auspicious qualities are endless and if one experiences his qualities, more and more new qualities appear for experience and thus the experience is endless. If taken as an epithet of the knower of Brahman, it means he is always fresh in the sense that his study of the veda is never forgotten.

“dhIra” – If taken for paramAtma, it is synonymous with the “sthAnu” nAma in the sahasranAma which means he is always firm in blessing his devotees. If taken for the jivA, it means he is steadfast in yoga or meditation on Brahman.

This concludes the Skambha Sukta, which waxes eloquent on the greatness of Sriman nArAyaNa, the support of all and highlights the important tattvas of vedAnta. This write-up is my humble submission to the lotus feet of Azhwar, EmperumAnAr and Jeeyar.
