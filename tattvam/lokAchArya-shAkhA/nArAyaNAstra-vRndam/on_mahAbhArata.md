#### Understanding the Mahābhārata

In between publishing the Ishvara Gita, we thought it would be a good idea to write a few articles on the Mahābhāratā. A proper understanding of this ithihāsā will dispel the several illogical and nonsensical ramblings about this work of Shri Vyāsa that is prevalent on the internet thanks to poor interpretations by Sacred-Texts.Com and based on some interpolated sections + misinterpretations propagated by some Veerashaivas and Mahapashupatastra type Neanderthals, who often resort to the Sacred Texts website.

This article is the first of whatever we see fit to include in future articles of this series. We will also be publishing Ishvara Gita articles as and when they are ready.

Introduction – Bhakti and Prapatti

In the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there are two means to moksha. As declared in the Agama:

bhaktyā paramayā vāpi prapattyā vā mahāmune ।

prāpyo'haṃ nānyathā prāpyaḥ mama kaiṅkaryalipsubhiḥ ॥ (~Ahirbudhnya Samhita, Pāncarātra)

Bhagavān has stated that there are two means – bhakti and prapatti - to attain him. As for the differences between the means, Shri Vedanta Desikan summarizes it beautifully in his Nyāsa Tilakam:

ārteṣvāśuphalā tadanyaviṣaye'pyucchinnadehāntarā

vahnyāderanapekṣaṇāttanubhṛtāṃ satyādivadvyāpinī ।

śrīraṅgeśvara yāvadātmaniyatatvatpāratantrayocitā

tvayyeva tvadupāyadhīrapihitasvopāyabhāvā'stu me ॥ (~Nyasa Tilakam 10)॥

Meaning: Prapatti yields the desired fruit of liberation immediately for one who wants it then, or it will yield the fruit at the time of death for one who wishes to wait (Bhakti in contrast yields fruit only after many births). This Prapatti Yoga does not require agni-karyas, ie, karma yoga (whereas bhakti yoga requires performance of nitya-naimittika karmas as part of karma yoga which is an accessory). This prapatti is open to all castes and can be practiced by men and women (Bhakti is open only to those who have vedādhikāra – the three upper castes, and only men). This Prapatti (lacking self effort) is suited to the nature of the Jīva that is“atyanta paratantra” (existing completely for the sake of) Shri Ranganatha (whereas bhakti which involves self effort is against the nature of the complete dependence of Atma). May this Prapatti become fruitful for me!

Thus, in one shloka, the differences between these two paths are mentioned. Several objections may arise as to how two diametrically opposed paths lead to the Lord, how lack of self effort is a means, etc. For the sake of brevity, the reader is advised to  consult “Nikshepa Raksha” of Shri Vedanta Desikan which discusses such things. For now, let us consider these 2 paths to moksha.

The Ramayana as Prapatti Sāstra and The Mahābhāratā as Bhakti Sāstra

Since there are two means to moksha, there are two ithihāsās as well – The Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhāratā. The Rāmāyaṇa is hailed as the “Saranāgati Sāstra” by all the wise Acharyas – for it expounds the nature of prapatti, details the activities of prapannas like Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Hanuman, Sugriva, Vibhishana, etc and shows that the Lord Rama is the one to be attained.

Some dullards like Appayya Dikshita tried to refute that this is a “Saranagati Shastra” in mediocre works like “Ananda Lahiri” – Likes of Appayya talking about the nectarine Rāmāyaṇa is the equivalent of a monkey handling a pearl necklace and can be safely ignored (in any case, we will address them sometime in the comments).

If Rāmāyaṇa is the prapatti shāstra, that means that the Mahābhāratā is the bhakti shāstra. Our Acharyas who were so involved in the prapatti mārga thus declared that out of the two, the Rāmāyaṇa is superlative – this is because prapatti is a superior path to bhakti.

Just as prapatti is a diametrically opposite path to bhakti, the two Ithihāsās are opposites. Here are some insights: the events in the Rāmāyaṇa read as a polar opposite to the Mahābhāratā

- Just as Prapatti is quicker and yields result in this lifetime itself, and is an easier means to bhakti which is ardous and takes several lifetimes to yield fruit, the Rāmāyaṇa is the shorter Ithihāsa as compared to the voluminous Mahābhāratā.
    
- Just as Prapatti focuses mainly on bhagavān, while bhakti involves meditations on other devatas as the sharIra of bhagavān, and some allied meditations on the self etc -- the Rāmāyaṇa is more focused on the history of Lord Rāmā, while the Mahābhāratā does not only talk about Lord Krishna, but the exploits of other devas, allied meditations to attain other fruits, etc.
    
- Just as Prapatti can also be performed as an Anga of Bhakti, the Mahābhāratā contains a condensed version of the events that happened in the Rāmāyaṇa, as narrated to the Pāndavas.
    

Besides these, the following characteristics of the two Ithihāsās show that they are polar opposites in nature, like bhakti and prapatti:

- In the Rāmāyaṇa, all effort to travel to the forest and to kill Rāvaṇa was undertaken by Lord Rāmā. In the Mahābhāratā, all the effort to travel to the forest and kill Duryodhana was undertaken by the Pāndavās, with Lord Krishna only as their indirect help, after vowing not to use weapons. This is similar to how the Lord is the direct means in Prapatti (which requires no effort from the Jīvā) and the indirect means in bhakti (which requires self-effort of the Jīvā).
    
- The Son of Sūrya, Sugrīva, was an ally to Rāmā. The Son of Sūrya, Karna, was on the opposite side of Krishna. Both signify desire (bhagavad kāmā vs loukika kāmā) as we shall see later.
    
- Lakshmana, the avatāra of Adi Sesha, was completely obedient to the Lord, which is the nature of a prapanna. Balarāma, the avatāra of the Lord with the amsha of Adi Sesha, was sometimes obedient to and sometimes disobedient. Lakshmana also was the younger brother to Rāmā while Balarāma was the older brother. Likewise, Prapatti is conducive to the svarūpa of the Jīva (to be below the Lord’s feet), as opposed to Bhakti which requires self-effort and hence causes ego.
    

(Note that Adi Sesha being a nitya-sūri in full knowledge, can never be disobedient, or become older to the Lord. Hence, the Lord himself appeared as BalarAma, carrying only the amsha of Adi Sesha!)

- The devas – Brahma, Rudra and Indra – are hailed as great jnānīs in the Rāmāyaṇa who praise the Lord Rāmā as the Supreme and at no point act against him. This illustrates that a Prapanna never acts against the Lord’s wishes, always in sync with the Lord’s thoughts. In contrast, all 3 devas rebelled against Krishna in the Mahābhāratā – Brahma by stealing the calves, Rudra by fighting Krishna during Bānāsura Yuddha and Indra by fighting Krishna during the Parijāta incident. This illustrates that a Bhakta could be clouded by rajas and tamas at times, to act against the Lord’s wishes.
    
- Lakshmi, whose mediatorship is more important in prapatti, is very much celebrated in the Rāmāyaṇa which is hailed as “Sītāyās Caritam Mahat”. Lakshmi, whose meditatorship is still required but of a diminished importance in comparison to one’s self-effort in bhakti, is not highly celebrated as Rukmini in the Mahābhārata
    

These few examples should suffice to prove that the Mahābhāratā is a bhakti shāstrā. No wonder Swami Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Nayanar called it “asat-keerthana” in the Acharya Hrudayam. Our acharyas had scant regard for bhakti as an upāya!

Udyoga Parva - Dialogue between Krishna and Karna - Description of the Mahābhāratā War as a Great Sacrifice

Let us thus, explore this in detail. In the Udyoga Parva of the Mahābhāratā, Karna converses with Krishna. Here, Karna expresses regret for his actions, and says that despite knowing he is the son of Pandu, he cannot leave Duryodhana.

During the course of this dialogue, Karna, in an effort to show Krishna that he understands the consequences fully, describes the impending war as a sacrifice. Here, “yajna” or “sacrifice” means worship – thus, Karna is describing the entire war as a desmonstration of Bhakti Yoga, the Rāja Vidya and Rāja Guhyam. By doing this, Karna is demonstrating that he is conversant of the fact that none can transgress Krishna and hope to win.

Here, a question may be asked – How does Karna, an asura, understand the tattvas of bhakti yoga? The answer is that Karna had pūrva janma puṇya – he was after all the son of the Sun-God, had a noble birth despite being raised by a sūta and so on. In fact, even Duryodhana describes the tattva of bhakti yoga via the narration of Tripura Samhara showing even he had some pūrva janma puṇya and jnāna. That they are asurās, is because of their disinclination to pursue the truth (Krishna) despite knowing it.

“Udyoga” means effort. It is thus apt that this parva contains the description of the effort of bhakti yoga.

With that, let us look at the relevant shlokas spoken by Karna to Krishna, starting below.

Krishna as the Means and End for Bhakti Yoga

dhārtarāṣṭrasya vārṣṇeya śastrayajño bhaviṣyati

asya yajñasya vettā tvaṃ bhaviṣyasi

janārdana ādhvaryavaṃ ca te kṛṣṇa kratāv asmin bhaviṣyati

Meaning: (Karna tells Krishna): O Scion of Vrishni! The son of Dhritarāshtra is going to conduct a sacrifice of arms. Of that sacrifice, know you, O Janārdana, to be the Adhvaryu. You, Krishna, are also the Object of Worship (Kratu) in the sacrifice.

Now, let us look at the inner meaning:

Inner Meaning: O Lord who comes from strength of bhakti-yoga (vārṣṇeya)!  The embodied self (Yudhishthira), associated with karmas that are the support of samsara (dhārtarāṣṭra), is going to conduct the worship of Bhakti Yoga (yajña) which is the instrument to destroy sins obstructing perception of Brahman (śastra).

O Lord who is destroyer of karmas (Janārdana)! Of that worship, know yourself as the “adhvaryu” -- who initiates or leads the uninterrupted meditation, ie, you are the means. You are also “kratu” -- the Object of Worship, ie, you are the end as well, O Lord who sports in the bliss of creation etc., (Kṛṣṇa).

Points for consideration:

- “dhārtarāṣṭrasya” means coming from dhrtarāshtra. The term “dhrtarāshtra” means those karmas which support (dhrta) samsārā which is “rāshtra”, Hence, “dhrtarāshtra” refers to karmas and “dhārtarāṣṭra” refers to  the body  associated with the karmas . Duryodhana refers to the body as we will see later. However, as the body is insentient, it is the self inside the body that is referred to by saying “body" due to inseparable association. Hence, “dhārtarāṣṭra” actually refers to the embodied self, closely associated with the body arising from karmas. That it is Yudhishthira is again something we will see later.
    
- “vārṣṇeya” means coming or arising from “Vrishni” which signifies “strength” that is a metaphor for “knowledge”. Direct perception of the Lord arises from Bhakti Yoga which is “jnāna-vishesha" and hence he is denoted by this name.
    
- “yajña” means worship which represents bhakti yoga. This yoga destroys all sins.
    
- The Lord is called “Adhvaryu” – “adhvara” means “uninterrupted” which refers to ceaseless meditation on Brahman which is the nature of bhakti yoga. As the Lord is the underlying means who enables this meditation by destroying sins obstructing such Yoga, he is called “Adhvaryu”.
    
- Note that “Janārdana” means destroyer of karmas – he protects the bhakti yogis by destroying sins that are obstacles to such yoga upon self-surrender to him and thus he is the means.
    
- As he is the object of worship (kratu) in this meditation, he alone is attained and hence is the end. That is signified by the name “Krishna” – One who is always blissful on account of indulging in sports like creation etc. It signifies that the Lord is the Jagatkāraṇa and he is “Anandamaya”, to be meditated upon, thus he is the end.
    

Some recensions have “upadrashta” instead of “kratu” – in that case, the meaning is “sākshi” or spectator – which signifies, according to Bhattar, that Krishna witnesses the muktas enjoying the bliss he confers on them when they reach him – so, again, we get the same meaning that the Lord is the end.

Thus, Karna establishes that Krishna alone - and not Brahma, Rudra or Indra - is the Supreme Brahman who is the means and end for Bhakti Yoga, to be undertaken by the Jīva. This fact is a death knell for Veerashaivas seeking to elevate Shiva or any other devata. Because bhakti yoga is described as the means to liberation and for meditation on Brahman by Bhagavad Bādarāyaṇa in the Brahma Sūtrās. Any devata that becomes the means and end for bhakti yoga is thus automatically the Supreme Being.

Hence, this proves that the mahābhāratā does not hail anyone other than Krishna as the Supreme Being. Having described this, the tools required for bhakti-yoga to be undertaken by the Jīva are described next.

The Role of Arjuna

hotā caivātra vībhatsuḥ saṃnaddhaḥ sa kapidhvajaḥ  
gāṇḍīvaṃ sruk tathājyaṃ ca vīryaṃ puṃsāṃ bhaviṣyati

Meaning: Arjuna, called Vibhatsu, having the banner of Hanuman, is the Hota. The bow Gandiva is the sacrificial ladle and the strength of the warriors shall be the clarified butter.

Inner Meaning: The pure mind called “Vibhatsu”, which is characterized by rapid movement (towards Brahman), is the Hota as it calls out or invites (self- surrender). The knowledge of the Upanishads, which is protected by the gods, is the sacrificial ladle. The strength of the senses constitutes the offering signified by butter.

Points for consideration:

- Arjuna signifies the mind. That is because “Vibhatsu” means “one who has never committed a detestable act on the battlefield” according to Arjuna as follows,
    

na kuryāṃ karma vībhatsaṃ yudhyamānaḥ kathaṃ cana

tena devamanuṣyeṣu vībhatsur iti māṃ viduḥ (~Goharana Parva, Mahabharata)

Meaning: I am known as Vibhatsu among gods and men, for my never having committed a detestable deed on the battle-field.

- The mind, which has never been swayed towards sense-objects while in the body (kshetra or battlefield), is pure and hence can be called “Vibhatsu”.
    
- Such a mind is said to have “kapi” as its’ banner – “kapi” signifying movement – and the mind always moves towards Brahman in devotion. It is called “Hota” as it calls out, ie, seeks the protection of Brahman.
    
- In the Bhagavad Yana Parva of Mahabharata, “Gandiva” is mentioned to be so named as it is protected by the gods. The Upanishads refer to knowledge as the “bow” as well, and Gandiva being of great strength, it signifies brahma-vidya which is protected by the gods, possessed by the mind (Vibhatsu).
    

Such a strong mind, bent towards Brahman, with knowledge of brahma-vidya, reins in the strength of the senses which sway one towards attachments – thus the strength of the senses are said to be sacrificed.

Special Notes on Arjuna:

- There are innumerable clues that Arjuna represents the mind in the Mahabharata.
    
- He is the son of Indra – “idi” means “paramaishvarye” – to own great wealth. Thus, the mind (Arjuna), as the channel for the intellect, is born from (ie, came into existence for the sake of) the self that owns wealth (Indra) in the form of enjoyments experienced through its’ intellect. It is the mind that facilites such enjoyment.
    
- Arjuna is also called “Nara” meaning “Imperishable”. The mind is often called that as it is difficult to conquer (when swayed towards senses), or is completely impervious to sense-objects (when detached and meditating on Brahman).
    

The killing of Jarāsandha also brings out this role of Arjuna. This has been attached as an appendix at the end of the article.

aindraṃ pāśupataṃ brāhmaṃ sthūṇākarṇaṃ ca mādhava  
mantrās tatra bhaviṣyanti prayuktāḥ savyasācinā

Meaning: Aindra, Pāśupata, Brahma, Sthunakarna will be the mantras (weapons denoted by mantrās) employed by Savyasācin (Arjuna) in that sacrifice, O Mādhava!

Inner Meaning: O Lord who bestows knowledge about himself (Mādhava)! Wealth such as jnāna and vairagya (Aindra), mastery over anger (Pāśupata), knowledge of the Vedas (Brahma) and the knowledge of the self that steers the body (sthūṇākarṇaṃ), are the protectors of the meditating Jīva, which will be employed by the ambidextrous mind (Savyasācin) capable of withdrawal from sense objects and meditation on Brahman, in that Bhakti Yoga!

Points for consideration:

- “Aindra” refers to wealth (idi- paramasihvarye according to Bhattar) and signifies knowledge of bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās and renounciation of different material objects.
    
- Mahānārāyaṇa Upanishad refers to “pasu” as anger and thus “pasupati” refers to one who has mastery over anger. “Brahma” refers to the knowledge of the Vedas.
    
- “sthuna” means pillar or support – it refers to the body which is the support of all activities done for sādhana  and “karna” means to steer – this refers to the knowledge of the self that leads to lack of desire, and thus steers the body in performing karmas without expectation of fruits.
    
- These are “mantrās” – mantāram trayate – that which protect the meditator.
    
- They are employed by the mind called “Savyasacin”. As Arjuna was able to use the Gandiva with both hands, similarly the mind uses the knowledge of the Upanishads ambidextrously – to withdraw the senses from sense objects, and to focus the senses on Brahman.
    
- Who is attained by such meditation of the mind? Is it Brahma, Rudra or Indra? Answer is no. It is the Lord Narayana, as conveyed by the name “Mādhava”, as per the following statement by Shiva to Krishna in the Harivamsha:
    

mā vidyā ca hareh proktā tasyā īso yato bhavān ।

tasmāt mā-dhava nāmāsi dhavah svāmīti ṣabditah ॥ (~Harivamsha 3.69.4)

Meaning: (Shiva tells Krishna:) The knowledge about of Hari is called mā. You are the Master of that knowledge. Therefore You are known as Mādhava. It has been stated (by wise acharyas) that “dhava” means “Svami” or Master.

The Role of Abhimanyu

anuyātaś ca pitaram adhiko vā parākrame

grāva stotraṃ sa saubhadraḥ samyak tatra kariṣyati

Meaning: Following his father, or even being greater in strength, the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu) shall be the foremost mantra to be chanted correctly.

Inner Meaning: Following the mind which is the agent of cause (pitaram), or that which is even more powerful than the mind, is the performance of desireless works  called “karma yoga”, the chief instrument or tool (Agrāva) for praise that is bhakti yoga (stotraṃ), that arises from knowledge of the self (saubhadraḥ) in the correct manner (as distinct from the body).

Points for Consideration:

- Arjuna is the mind. From the mind (Arjuna) which is detached, possessing knowledge of the Upanishads, arises the performance of works that do not seek any result (Abhimanyu). So Abhimanyu represents “karma yoga”.
    
- This karma yoga or desireless works (Abhimanyu) is also said to arise from a correct knowledge of the self as  distinct from the body denoted by “subhadra” – su meaning “subha” in the sense of right or correctness and “bhadra” meaning good which is in the sense of knowledge that causes good (understanding the self as distinct from the body).
    
- “agrāva  stotram” – “stotram” means instrument or tool of praise. “Praise” is nothing but bhakti yoga, wherein the yogi who experiences bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās will praise them, or it is a contemplation of the Lord who alone is fit to be praised for his bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās. This performance of desireless works (Abhimanyu), is the chief tool of praise, meaning, it is the major accessory to bhakti-yoga.
    
- Abhimanyu could be even stronger than his father (adhiko vā parākrame). Likewise, performance of desireless works by dedicating their fruits to paramātma could be even superior to merely meditating on the Lord or being detached, as it quickly results in the true knowledge of one’s nature as the sesha and the Lord as the seshi.
    

Special Notes on Abhimanyu:

- The chakravyūha represents samsārā. The kauravās represent the dangers of samsāra.
    
- Abhimanyu represents the performance of desireless works, which has arisen from a mind that is detached (Arjuna).  In the Isavasya Upanishad we come across a statement:
    

andham tamah pravisanti ye'vidyamupasate  
tato bhuya iva te tamo ya u vidyayam ratah  (~Isavasya Upanishad 9)

Meaning: Those who meditate on karma (avidya) alone, enter into a blinding darkness. But those who are devoted to knowledge (vidya) alone enter into a greater darkness than the former.

“Avidya” represents performance of duties according to varnāshrama dharma (avidyā karma samjnānyā – vishṇu purāṇa).”Vidya” represents meditation on Paramātman. The Upanishad goes on to teach that both are to be done together for moksha. The performance of duties without understanding they are to be considered part of the meditation on Brahman will lead to earthly enjoyments and further bondage to samsāra. The meditation on Brahman done without performing the rituals, thinking the latter serve no purpose, will lead to failure of meditation as the sins which obstruct meditation cannot be removed without performance of works. Hence, he will experience the fruits of bad karmas in hell and other places. Furthermore, it is even worse than the previous person as incomplete meditation will result in bad effects.

- Hence, Abhimanyu is “Avidya” – the performance of works – which alone could not escape the chakravyūha (samsāra), being separated from Arjuna who is “Vidya” - the mind that is meditating on Brahman (Krishna) -  and perished. Abhimanyu surrounded by Kauravas and dying is like the performer of works without knowledge being beset by kāmā, krodha etc and gaining attachment to samsāra through his works.
    
- Thus, Arjuna is “Vidya” – Detached mind associated with Krishna, meditating on Brahman. He too could not overcome the chakravyūha (samsara) without Abhimanyu (Avidya). Separated from Abhimanyu, he lost his composure, went mad with grief and nearly committed suicide.
    
- One can argue that Arjuna’s grief was even greater than Abhimanyu’s grief, as it is the worst form of torture for a father to see his son die. Hence, Vidya alone leads to a greater darkness than Avidya alone. Without performance of works that removes sins obstructing meditation on the self, the meditation fails and succumbs to the vices of despair, anger, attachment etc.
    
- Note that “Abhimanyu” means “towards or surrounding manyu (knowledge)” – “manyu” meaning knowledge (mana j~jāne) denotes bhakti yoga. Thus, the performance of desireless action (karma yoga) that foster a knowledge of the self is that which is conducive to bhakti yoga, or that which protects bhakti yoga (by facilitating its’ completion).
    

Special Notes on Krishna, Balarama and Subhadra:

A similar meaning is gleaned if we consider that Krishna, Balarāmā and Subhadra were related – Krishna is the Supreme Lord to be attained, Balarāmā is bhakti yoga (balarāmā  - delighting in strength or balam being a metaphor for knowledge) and Subhadra is jnāna yoga that is an accessory to bhakti, or in this context as their sister, she can even be termed the combination of jnāna yoga (knowledge of the Atman) that is itself a component of karma yoga (performing desireless works which require knowledge of the self).

The Role of Bhīma

udgātātra punar bhīmaḥ prastotā sumahābalaḥ

vinadan sa naravyāghro nāgānīkāntakṛd raṇe

Meaning: Bhīma, who is of great strength, that tiger among men who destroys the elephants, who roars in battle, is again the Udgātā and the Prastotā, the singers of the Vedic hymns.

Inner Meaning: Meditation on Brahman, which is formidable to samsārā (Bhīma), that which is pre-eminently strong among the “imperishables” which are means to liberation (naravyāghra), which destroys the numerous sins denoted by elephants, that frightens samsāra, is again that which rises above desire (udgātā) and the very form of praise or experience of bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās (Prastotā).

Points for Consideration:

- Bhīma signifies meditation on Brahman. “sumahābalaḥ” signifies great strength of yoga to destroy sins, as “balam” signifies knowledge which is the nature of Yoga.
    
- Bhīma’s roars make the enemies tremble. Likewise, meditation on Brahman metaphorically makes our karmas tremble, as they will be destroyed. Note that “Bhīma” means formidable for this reason.
    
- Such meditation is the destroyer of sins (elephants). The elephants signify sins obstructing perception of Brahman. “raṇa” signifies the individual self that is doing battle with samsārā.
    
- “vyāghra” means anything that is pre-eminent. The various means to various ends are denoted by “nara” as they are imperishable. Meditation on Brahman is superior to all other means to attain all other ends because of the superiority of the end (bhagavad-prāpti) as compared to aishvarya etc and also because such meditation is pleasurable in itself (unlike meditation on the self which is difficult).
    
- “udgātā” means rising above and signifies that such meditation enables one to rise above desire. “Prastotā” means it is of the form of praise, ie, it is the very svarūpa of bhakti yoga.
    

Special Notes on Bhīma:

- Bhīma is the son of Vāyu. Thus, “Vāyu” signifies movement of the self in devotion towards Brahman.
    
- Hence, meditation is born from such devotion, which is immensely strong as it can destroy all sins.
    
- Bhīma is also called “Vrkodara” – a wolf-bellied or a voracious eater. The meditation “eats” or experiences immense bliss of bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās. Alternatively, it “eats” or destroys all karmas.
    

Role of Yudhishthira

sa caiva tatra dharmātmā śaśvad rājā yudhiṣṭhiraḥ

japair homaiś ca saṃyukto brahmatvaṃ kārayiṣyati

Meaning: King Yudhishthira, of noble mind, who is ever engaged in Japa and Homa, is accorded the position of “Brahma” in the sacrifice.

Inner Meaning: The Jīva which is the sovereign of the body (raja), which is unperturbed by samsāra (Yudhiṣṭhiraḥ), of a mind bent towards dharma or the proper means (dharmātmā) is ever engaged in the chanting of OM (Japa) and the sacrifice of self-surrender (homa), is “brahma” in the worship of bhakti yoga, as its’ knowledge is vast.

Should be self-explanatory. “Yudhiṣṭhiraḥ” means steady or firm in the battlefield, and hence refers to not being disturbed by samsara. The individual self is “brahma" as its dharma-bhūta-jnāna is capable of extending to infinity (Sa anantāya kalpate – śvetāsvatāra).

Special Notes on Yudhishthira:

Yudhishthira is Dharmaputra. The self has a pita-putra sambandha with the Lord, whose names are “dharma” and “Dharmarāja”.

Role of the Pandava Army

śaṅkhaśabdāḥ samurajā bheryaś ca madhusūdana

utkṛṣṭasiṃhanādāś ca subrahmaṇyo bhaviṣyati

Meaning: O Slayer of Madhu! The sound of conches, drums and kettle drums, as well as the lion-like roars will be the “subrahmanya” of the sacrifice.

Inner Meaning: O Slayer of Rajo Guṇa or desire called “Madhu”! The various aids to meditation will be very beneficial to the individual self called “Brahman” in bhakti-yoga.

- The subrahmanya, along with the prastotr and pratihartr, assists the udgatr with the sacrifice. Here, we have to assume the sounds refer to the Pandava army and not the Kauravas for the meaning to make sense.
    
- Remember that Bhima who signifies meditation was the udgatr and prastotr. In such a case, these sounds signify the various aids that help in meditation on Brahman.
    
- These aids include purification of the body through Sattvic food and cleaniness (viveka), freedom from Kama and Krodha (vimoka), continuous rememberance of the indwelling Lord (abhyasa), Five-fold duties of the Vedas (Kriya), Practice of truth, integrity, daya and ahimsa (kalyana), freedom from despair arising from disappointment and being cheerful (Anavasada) and finally absence of exaltation, ie, avoiding extremes (Anuddharsa).
    
- “subrahmanya” means that which is beneficial to the Jīva designated as  Brahman.
    

Role of Nakula and Sahadeva

nakulaḥ sahadevaś ca mādrīputrau yaśasvinau  
śāmitraṃ tau mahāvīryau samyak tatra kariṣyataḥ

Meaning: The two sons of Mādrī, Nakula and Sahadeva, who are celebrated and with great valor, will be the subduers (of the sacrificial animal) in the sacrifice.

Inner Meaning: The qualities that arise from the Lord known as “Mādrī”, or possessor of Mādra– the kalyāṇa-guṇās of Brahman associated with bliss – namely, the quality of control over the mind (Nakula) and the quality of restraint of the senses from indulging in wordly actions (Sahadeva), which are highly glorious, and greatly eminent among the qualities of the Jivatma, will be the subduers of anger resulting from attachments.

- Meditation on Brahman results in several mental faculties (buddhir jñānam asammohaḥ ~ Gita 10.4-5). Of these, the guṇās of Sama and Dama are most important as per Shri Vachana Bhushanam of Shri Pillai Lokacharya (Atma gunangalil pradhaanam samamum damamum ~ Shri Vachana Bhushanam 96).
    
- “Mādrī” refers to the Supreme Brahman who is the possessor of “Mādra” – Here, “madra” means joy or bliss, and “Mādra” denotes the bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās that are associated with bliss. From this Lord, by meditating on him, the following qualities arise in the Jīva.
    
- “Nakula” – Not having a “kula” or abode – it means, not abiding in the mind which is the “abode” here. It refers to control of the mind (Sama).
    
- “Sahadeva” – with (saha), the mind which is called “Deva” on account of shining out external objects – the sense organs are checked from worldly activities and are thus said to abide with the mind in obedience. This is the quality of Dama.
    
- These qualities quieten or subdue “anger” arising from attachments which is the sacrificial animal. “śāmitraṃ” refers to those who slaughter the animal – “Sam” means to quieten or subdue.
    

Special Notes on Nakula and Sahadeva:

- Nakula and Sahadeva were sons of the Asvins. Nakula was the son of Nāsatya and Sahadeva was the son of Dasra.
    
- “Satya” refers to the Atman, “asatya” refers to all things other than it. “Nāsatya” thus refers to the mind that does not (na) dwell in sense objects (asatya). From such a mind (Nāsatya), Nakula (Sama) is born.
    
- “Dasra” means “Destroyer of enemies” – the mind which destroys the activities of the senses which are enemies as they sway one towards sense objects. From such a mind (Dasra), Sahadeva (Dama) is born.
    

Description of Accessories for Bhakti Yoga

1- Bodies needed for Sādhana

kalmāṣadaṇḍā govinda vimalā rathaśaktayaḥ

yūpāḥ samupakalpantām asmin yajñe janārdana

Meaning: The variegated chariots with bright standards, O Govinda, will be the sacrificial stakes made ready in this sacrifice, O protector of people from the wicked (Janārdana)!

Inner Meaning: The impure or dirty bodies called “chariots” with pure minds that supervise the bodies, O rescuer of the Earth (Govinda), will be the protectors (yūpāḥ) made ready (for meditation on Brahman) in this bhakti-yoga, O protector of the people by destroying the wicked (Janārdana).

Points for Consideration:

- The bodies of the transmigrating self in all its’ births are referred to as chariots. Bhakti Yoga is a process spanning many births and hence, many bodies. In each birth, the minds of these bodies are pure on account of yoga.
    
- The mind is called “danda” to signify authority – it has authority or control over the body and prevents it from enjoying sense-objects. This ties up or restrains anger arising from attachments.
    
- “yūpa” means “ayopaya” – that which effaces or blots out – the bodies and minds are used to remove anger or attachments. Since the mahānarāyaṇa Upanishad refers to anger as the animal to be sacrificed, these bodies and minds are referred to as sacrificial stakes.
    
- How can the impure bodies be called removers of anger? The bodies are impure by nature on account of having karmas. But the bodies are being used for performance of desireless works (karma yoga), while the pure mind is meditating on Brahman. Thus, they are both removing anger and being made ready for Yoga.
    
- Bhagavan is called Govinda – he protects “Go” signifying the embodied self as it is associated with a body made of Earth. He is called “Janārdana” as he destroys the wicked attachments for the yogi, thus protecting the latter.
    

2- Sons, Acharya, Good Qualities needed for Upāsaṇa

karṇinālīkanārācā vatsadantopabṛṃhaṇāḥ  
tomarāḥ somakalaśāḥ pavitrāṇi dhanūṃṣi ca

Meaning: Barbed arrows, the spear type of arrows, the iron arrows, as well as those shaped like the tooth of a calf, will be the nourishers of the sacrifice. The lances will be the vessels of Soma, and the bows will be the pavitrās.

Inner Meaning: The Acharya who steers the Jīva (karṇin), lack of falsehood, ie, Truth (nālīka), reflection of the Atman in the subtle and gross state signified by the sharp arrow (nārācā), the enjoyment of offspring (vatsadanta) are the nourishers of bhakti yoga. The senses that destroy pain (tomarāḥ) will be the vessels of nectar which are bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās (somakalaśāḥ). The knowledge of the Upanishads signified by “bows” are the purifiers.

Points for Consideration:

- “karṇin” means that which steers opr guides and refers to the Acharya. The Acharya’s compassionate teaching is required to commence upāsaṇa according to the Svetāsvatāra.
    
- Nālīka (Na+alika) is the non-utterance of falsehood. It is representative of all good qualities in general.
    
- The sharp arrow (nārācā) signifies reflection on the gross and subtle states of the jīvātman brought about by meditation on paramātma. These are all accessories for yoga.
    
- “danta” means teeth which refers to eating, ie, enjoyment. “vatsa” means offspring. Thus, having offspring in the form of sons, etc. is an accessory for bhakti-yoga.
    
- “tomarāḥ” – tohati maraḥ - the senses which destroy pain by withdrawing from sense-objects are the vessels of “soma” – nectar which is of the form of experience of Brahman. The knowledge of the Upanishads, which is of many kinds since there are innumerable bhagavad-kalyāṇa-guṇās, are the purifiers.
    

3- Performance of Duties, Knowledge of the Upanishads and Love of Bhagavān

asayo 'tra kapālāni puroḍāśāḥ śirāṃsi ca

havis tu rudhiraṃ kṛṣṇa asmin yajñe bhaviṣyati

Meaning: The swords will be the troughs called “Kapalas” (used to cook rice-cakes), the heads of those who are killed will be the rice-cakes. Their blood, O Krishna, will be the havis in this sacrifice.

Inner Meaning: The Niṣkāma Karmas that cut away attachments are like swords which are the protectors of the self that is blissful by nature (kapālāni). The Upanishads (śirāṃsi) are the bestowers of the knowledge that precedes direct perception of Brahman (puroḍāśāḥ). Affection or love of Bhagavān signified by “red” will be the offering in this worship, O Lord who has a dark-blue complexion (Krishna)!

Points for Consideration:

- Performance of prescribed duties is likened to swords as they cleave away attachments.
    
- “Kapālāni” – The actions done without desire for fruits are protectors (pālakās) of the self which is blissful (kah) by nature.
    
- The Upanishads which are the heads of the Vedas (śirāṃsi), provide apara-vidya or knowledge of Brahman. They are “Puroḍāśāḥ” -  meaning those that bestow in front – they bestow the knowledge that preceds upāsaṇa and brahma-sākshātkāra.
    
- “rudhiraṃ” means red. In the shāstrās, desire is signified by red color. This desire is the affection or love of bhagavān offered (havis) by the Jīva to  bhagavān .
    
- Love of bhagavān is directed to the beautiful Lord, whose dark-blue complexion (Krishna) indeed causes such love in the Jīva! Did not the gopīs love his bewitching form? Even Duryodhana called him lotus-eyed!
    

4- Other miscellaneous aids to cultivate love of bhagavān

idhmāḥ paridhayaś caiva śaktyo 'tha vimalā gadāḥ

sadasyā droṇaśiṣyāś ca kṛpasya ca śaradvataḥ

Meaning: The kindlings and enclosures are indeed the spears and bright maces. The assisting priests (sadasyās) will be the disciples of Drona and Kripa, the son of Saradvata.

Inner Meaning: The aids or ancillaries such as living near temples, etc (śaktyā) will be the kindlings or lighters which create love of Brahman needed for Yoga (idhmāḥ). The perceptions of many kinds of bhagavad-kalyāna-guṇās which are pure  (vimalā gadāḥ) are the enclosures or protectors (paridhayaś) of that love of Brahman. The assessors of the success of Yoga (sadasyā) shall be the qualities guided (śiṣyāś) by indifference to everything else (droṇa) and a longing or lament (for a vision of Brahman) which in turn arises from Time (kṛpasya ca śaradvataḥ).

Points for Consideration:

- The previous shloka said love for bhagavān is offered by the Jīva. This shloka describes the aids that foster such love, for it is not easy to obtain such an extreme love of bhagavān immediately.
    
- “Śakti” means aid. The various aids or ancillaries to Yoga include living near temples, performing services such as lighting lamps, chanting bhagavad-nāmās, knowledge and understanding of his avatārās, making flower garlands, Purushottama Vidya, etc as mentioned by Pillai Lokacharya in Mumukkshupadi.
    
- idhma –“indh” means to kindle or light up. These aids inculcate the extreme love of Brahman required for undertaking upāsaṇa. Alternatively, it means they burn away sins obstructing such love of Brahman and for undertaking Yoga.
    
- vimalā gadāḥ -  The varied perceptions of innumerable bhagavad-kalyāna-guṇās during Yoga sustain this love, protecting it from being lost and hence are the enclosures. In the Vishṇu Purāna, the mace of the Lord signifies intellect, and hence the meaning “perception” as in “understanding by meditation” is taken here. It is “vimalā” as bhagavad-kalyāna-guṇās are aprākrta.
    

Special Notes on Drona and Kripa:

- “sadasyā” refers to those priests who assess the sacrifice to see if it is being properly conducted. Similarly, the assessment of the success of bhakti yoga is gauged by the manifestation of qualities that express indifference to everything other than Brahman and an earnest longing for Brahman.
    
- “droṇa” – “drumamayam” – wooden – this signifies indifference like wood to everything other than Brahman. Note that Bharata was called “Jada Bharata” because he had an indifference to everything like an insentient object.
    
- “kṛpa” – to long for, or lament – a jnāni is always crying or lamenting separation from Bhagavān.
    
- “krpa” or lament arises from “śaradvataḥ” – full of years, signifying Time of separation from Bhagavān till moksha.
    
- “śiṣyā” – the qualities like crying, anger, extreme happiness, dancing, laughing suddenly etc manifested by the jnāni in his experience of Brahman which are guided by the above two characteristics of Drona and Krpa. “śiṣyā” means to be taught, as in guided.
    

Meditation on Brahman – The Process of Bhakti Yoga

After describing the aids to bhakti yoga, the following shloka describes how bhakti-yoga, together with its’ accessories, is undertaken.

iṣavo 'tra paristomā muktā gāṇḍīvadhanvanā  
mahārathaprayuktāś ca droṇa drauṇipracoditāḥ

Meaning: The arrows shot by wielder of the Bow Gandiva and by other great chariot-warriors, Drona and Drona’s son, will be the “paristomā” or cushion/seat (of the sacrifice).

Inner Meaning: The concentrated reflections on various auspicious attributes of Brahman (iṣavo) resulting from (prayukta) the brahma-vidya that is the knowledge of the Upanishads (gāṇḍīvadhanvanā), the bodies that are great on account of their suitability for yoga (mahāratha), directed or impelled (pracodita) by karma-yoga comprising of indifference to material objects arising from desireless action (droṇa) and jnāna-yoga which is the vision of the self that arises from such karma-yoga (drauṇi) is said to be away from or opposed to the collection of punya and pāpa karmas that obstruct liberation.

Points for Consideration:

- This describes the process of bhakti yoga, ie, how to undertake it together with all the accessories mentioned earlier.
    
- Arrows refer to concentrated meditation and are in plural as there are many auspicious attributes of bhagavān.
    
- As mentioned earlier, “Gandiva” refers to brahma-vidya, the bow is the knowledge of the Upanishads.
    
- “mahāratha” refers to the body or bodies in successive births of the bhakti-yogi, that are great (mahat) on account of their suitability for yoga (belonging to topmost castes, possessing strength to carry out yoga etc).
    
- “Droṇa” as mentioned earlier signifies indifference like wood to the fruits of actions. It is karma-yoga.
    
- “Drauṇir” is the vision of the self or jnāna-yoga that arises from such karma-yoga (Drona). Just as Drona and Ashvattama his son guided the pandavās in his studies, similarly, the karma and jnāna yogās guide the jīva (yudhishthira), mind (arjuna), meditation (bhīma) etc in attaining the state of bhakti yoga.
    
- This is “paristomā” – that which is away from (pari) multitudes or collection (stomā). In other words, this meditation is opposed to the multitudes or collections of punya and pāpa karmas as it is of a purifying nature. This signifies the end to be attained, ie, liberation in the form of direct perception of Brahman.
    

The Condition of the Bhakti Yogi

Now, how must the jīva who has successfully commenced bhakti yoga behave and what is he like? That is described in these shlokas.

prātiprasthānikaṃ karma sātyakiḥ sa kariṣyati

dīkṣito dhārtarāṣṭro 'tra patnī cāsya mahācamūḥ

Meaning: The duties of the position of prātiprasthāta, the assistant of the Adhvaryu, will be performed by Sātyaki. The son of Dhrtarāshtra, will be the one who has undergone consecration for the sacrifice (dīkṣita) and his wife (who aids in the sacrifice) shall be the large army (mahācamūḥ).

Inner Meaning: The various acts of service to Bhagavān will be performed by the realization of, “I am the sesha and the Lord is the seshi” (Sātyaki) while being in the condition of being opposed (prati) to abiding in ahamkāra and mamakāra (prasthā).  The jīva associated with karmas that are the support of the body (dhārtarāṣṭra) is ready, ie, eligible for moksha (dīkṣita) and the entire Universe with objects of enjoyment (mahācamūḥ) is subject to him (patnī).

Points for Consideration:

- The individual self undertaking yoga must do all that is mentioned in this shloka.
    
- “sātyakiḥ” – The individual self is called “satyaka” as it is established in the truth of its’ nature as the servant of the Lord. The realization of this comes from meditating on the self, and thus this realization is called “sātyaki” or coming from satyaka.
    
- It is with this realization that the Lord is the seshi and the individual self is the sesha that the prescribed duties are performed. Swami Pillai Lokacharya says “karmamum kainkaryathile pugum” (all the duties that one has to perform become a service to the Lord, as opposed to aiming for petty fruits). This is “svayam-prayojana bhakti” (bhakti that is an end in itself).
    
- “prātiprasthānikaṃ” – opposed to abiding in possessiveness and ego. “Isavasya Idam Sarvam” – everything, including me, belongs to Bhagavān Vāsudeva. This must be the thinking of the meditating jīva.
    
- Such a Jīva is ready for moksha (dīkṣita) – a mumukkshu -- as he is a krita-kritya, one who has done what needs to be done.
    
- The only thing still keeping this mumukkshu in samsāra are the remaining karmas, thus Karna refers to him as “Dhrtarāshtra” or associated with karmas that support the body.
    
- “patnī” is a general term for subjugation. “camū” refers to a vessel that one drinks from which signifies the Universe containing the objects of experience. It is called “mahācamū” as there are many such objects of enjoyment. All these become subject to the Jīva and no longer bind him in samsāra. To a jnāni, everything is at his disposal. The Vedas, wealth, varnāshrama – nothing binds him, though he will continue to keep up the pretense of being bound to their dictates for loka-kshema and setting an example to others.
    

This shloka reminds one of Ghora Angirasa’s declaration in the Chandogya Upanishad:

taddhaitadghor āṅgirasaḥ kṛṣṇāya devakīputrāyoktvovācāpipāsa eva sa babhūva so'ntavelāyāmetattrayaṃ pratipadyetākṣitamasyacyutamasi prāṇasam̐śitamasīti tatraite dve ṛcau bhavataḥ ॥ (~Chandogya Upanishad)

Meaning: The Rishi Ghora Angirasa practiced this Purusha Yajna with the dedication as "This is sub-servient to Krishna, the Son of Devaki". That Ghora Angirasa had not thirst, as he came upon Brahmavidyā through this. At the last moment of his life, he said to Brahman, "you are eternal, you are full of auspicious qualities, you are the subtle truth enlivening this universe".

Kṛṣṇāya means "Kṛṣṇaseṣabhūta" - for the sake of Krishna (the essential nature of the jīvātmān is seshatva or servitude to Devaki Putra Krishna).  ityuktvā means anusandhāna. One can see the same thoughts echoed by Karna in this shloka to the self-same Son of Devaki.

Note that post the war (bhakti yoga), only the 5 Pāndavas, Sātyaki and Krishna remained. Thus, only the self (Yudhishthira), the mind (Arjuna), meditation on Brahman (Bhīma), the qualities of the mind – Sama and Dama (Nakula and Sahadeva) along with the realization of one’s seshatvam to the Lord (Sātyaki) and the Lord himself (Krishna) remain. All other aids are not required and thus perished.

Disturbance in Bhakti Yoga and Its’ Remedy

The path of bhakti yoga is like a razor’s edge. Even after successfully establishing oneself in Yoga, there are many pitfalls which may happen. This shloka describes the potential disturbance in Yoga.

ghaṭotkaco 'tra śāmitraṃ kariṣyati mahābalaḥ  
atirātre mahābāho vitate yajñakarmaṇi

Meaning: O Lord who has mighty arms! When the activities of the sacrifice during the extremely dark night commence, then Ghatotkacha of immense strength will perform the (duty of) the subduing (the animal) in the sacrifice.

Inner Meaning: O Lord who has mighty arms capable of protecting his devotees (mahābāho)! When the activities of bhakti yoga (yajñakarmaṇi) are covered by the dense darkness of sins caused by rajo and tamo guṇās (atiratre), then the act of making the effort in the form of worshipping the Lord without motive to rise above sins (ghaṭotkaca), which is greatly powerful (mahābalaḥ), will perform the subduing (śāmitraṃ) of rajo and tamo guṇās responsible for those sins.

Points for Consideration:

- At some point, the Yogi will undergo a disturbance in bhakti yoga. Unlike prapatti which relies on the Lord’s effort as the direct means for moksha, bhakti yoga relies on one’s own effort with the Lord as the underlying means and so is not perfect.
    
- This shloka is an explanation of Gita 9.29 and 9.30. In these Gita shlokas, Sri Krishna states that even if his devotee is sinful, he must be regarded as on the path of virtue. Here, sins refer to transgressing the rules of his caste, or failure to avoid things that are forbidden in the Vedas.
    
- Such sins can happen even if one is a bhakti yogi on the path of virtue. Bhagavan explains that such a flawed person is still exalted as he is a devotee.
    
- However, it is a fact that shāstras claim that if such transgressions happen, they will obstruct the flow of meditation and lead to failure of bhakti yoga. Bhagavān addresses that in Gita 9.30 and says that even such a person will be purified very quickly as follows.
    
- How will this person be purified quickly? This person, being devoted to the Lord, worships him without any ulterior motive. This worship purifies the devotee, ridding him of rajo and tamo guṇās which are responsible for his lapses and being free from all behavior and sins which impede progress in Yoga, he attains the Lord.
    
- Thus, while the Yogi is interrupted by sins arising from his rajo and tamo guṇās during Yoga, he is able to overcome them by worshipping the Lord selflessly with no motive, which purifies him and allows him to commence Yoga.
    
- “atirātre vitate yajñakarmaṇi” refers to bhakti yoga being impeded by the darkness of transgressions.
    
- Then, “ghaṭotkaca” means the rising up above the sins that cause such transgressions (utkaca) by making the effort in the form of selfless worship of the Lord (ghatate). This would subdue the rajo and tamo guṇās, uprooting them by their roots and allow progress in Yoga.
    
- Note that Ghaṭotkaca is the son of Bhīma. As we know, Bhīma signifies the meditation on Brahman that is upāsaṇa. Then, Ghatotkacha is the selfless worship of the Lord that arises from such meditation (Bhīma)  which leads to a love of Brahman.
    
- Karna calls the Lord as one who has mighty arms to show that bhagavān has the strength in his arms to shoulder the burden of those who surrender to him. He also uses his arms to remove the evil-doers of the world, like the karmas. The names “subhuja” and “visvabāhu” in the sahasranāma explain these qualities.
    

The Examples of Two Great Bhakti Yogis - Bhishma and Rudra

- Bhishma was an exalted bhakti yogi – a madhu-vidyā upāsaka. But he incurred a curse which made him be born as a human, got him involved in worldly affairs which disturbed his Yoga. Eating food at Duryodhana’s place contaminated with vāsaṇās rajas and tamas. Thus, Bhishma became clouded in mind and sided with the Kauravas despite knowing Krishna was against them. But he still worshipped Krishna selflessly. Hence, Bhishma was drained of his blood which contained rajo and tamo guṇās from eating tāmasic food, by the arrows of Arjuna. He mentions later that he has been purified, no longer feels attached to either the Kauravas and Pandavas and recited the sahasranāma . Krishna then grants him the status of Vasu, from where he can commence his madhu-vidya upāsaṇa to attain moksha.
    
- Rudra is the greatest of all bhakti yogis. But on a few occasions, he became clouded by rajo and tamo guṇās, and fought the Lord (at Badarikashramam, during bānāsura yuddha etc). The Lord himself came to meet Rudra on these occasions, defeated him, and after Rudra sought pardon from him, put him on the right path.
    
- When great personalities like Bhishma and Rudra faced obstacles in their Yoga, lesser Yogis are undoubtedly going to face them. Even Prahlada fought with Vishnu when he grew up due to this.
    

  

The Fruit of Bhakti Yoga

Having described how interruptions in Yoga are eliminated by the grace of bhagavān, this shloka describes the fruit of such Yoga which has commenced successfully to completion.

dakṣiṇā tv asya yajñasya dhṛṣṭadyumnaḥ pratāpavān  
vaitāne karmaṇi tate jāto yaḥ kṛṣṇa pāvakāt

Meaning: The fee (dakṣiṇā) of this sacrifice is the powerful Dhrshtadhymna, who was born from the black colored fires after performance of sacrificial activities.

Inner Meaning: The reward or end (dakṣiṇā) of this bhakti yoga (yajña) is the perception of wealth that Brahman (dhṛṣṭadyumnaḥ), which is powerful as it burns away all remaining sins (pratāpavān), which is produced from the clear (understanding of) the individual self that is the ground of bliss (kṛṣṇa) after the activities (karmaṇi) that constitute selfless worship of the Lord (vaitāna).

Points for Consideration:

- The direct perception of Brahman is brought about by the completion of bhakti yoga, after understanding the nature of the self (as sesha to bhagavān) by jnāna yoga, which in turn occurred after the performance of activities to worship the Lord without desire for fruits (karma yoga).
    
- This direct perception results in destruction of sins, leading to death and liberation immediately.
    
- “dhṛṣṭadyumnaḥ” – “visible/perception (dhṛṣṭa) of wealth (dyumnaḥ)”. Bhagavān is the sole wealth of his devotees as evidenced by names like “lakshmih” in the sahasranāma. Alternatively, it refers to his divine auspicious body which is his wealth, and which is perceived in the manner of supporting the tattvas described in astra-bhūshaṇa adhyāya of vishṇu purāṇa.
    
- “pratāpavān” – This perception burns away all remaining sins leading to liberation.
    
- “kṛṣṇa pāvakāt” – This perception is born from the clarity of the nature of the individual self. “pāvakā” means clear in terms of clear vision or understanding. “kṛṣṇa” – According to Bhattar, “krishi” means “bhū” in the sense of container or receptacle or ground. “ṇa” means nivritti or bliss. The jīvātma is the ground of bliss (kṛṣṇa) as it has ananda as its attribute and nature. Hence “kṛṣṇa pāvakāt” refers to understanding the nature of the self as subservient to bhagavān with clarity.
    
- “vaitāne karmaṇi” refers to karma yoga which involved selfless worship of the lord that led to the understanding of the individual self.
    

Role of Karna and Remorse over Bhāgavata-Apachāra arising from Desire

yad abruvam ahaṃ kṛṣṇa kaṭukāni sma pāṇḍavān  
priyārthaṃ dhārtarāṣṭrasya tena tapye 'dya karmaṇā

Meaning: O Krishna! For those words of mine, which were harsh, that I spoke to the Pandavas for the sake of gratifying Duryodhana, for those actions, I repent.

Inner Meaning: O Lord, who has a dark blue complexion (kṛṣṇa )! For those words of mine (self associated with desire or lust), which were harsh, that I spoke to the sāttvikās who are devotees of the Lord (pāṇḍavān), for the sake of gratifying attachments against the nature of the self, arising from karmas that support the body (dhārtarāṣṭrasya), for those actions of mine in the past which have wounded the bhāgavatas, I repent.

Points of Consideration:

- An anga of bhakti yoga is to avoid bhāgavata-apachāra and seek prayascitta for prior transgressions.
    
- Hence, a yogi in the final stage of Yoga and prior to casting away his body would repent any transgressions to devotees he had knowingly or unknowingly committed.
    
- “Karna” is the eldest of the pāndavās. His name means “steer” or “helm”. He signifies desire or lust that is even higher than the mind (Arjuna) or the meditation (Bhīma) or the self (Yudhishthira) as it is difficult to control. It is this lust that causes bhāgavata-apachāra.
    
- Desire (Karna) allies with the body that is against the nature of the self – that is signified by the name of “Duryodhana” – “One who fights in an evil or wicked manner” – it signifies the body that “fights” against the true nature of the self by pulling us towards attachments.
    
- Note that Karna (desire) and Arjuna (mind) were sworn enemies. Likewise, desire and the mind fight a perpetual battle for control.
    
- The same desire is corrected and trained to focus on bhagavān – as bhagavad kāma leads to moksha. Thus, Krishna tried to convince Karna to join the Pandavas and Karna, the personified desire, is saying these words.
    
- When Karna speaks these words, it must be understood as the words of the self associated with such desire.
    
- Note that Karna refers to the dark-blue complexion of the Lord by addressing him as “Krishna”. The best remedy for lust towards material objects is to redirect that lust towards bhagavān’s beautiful body.
    

Special Notes on Karna:

- There is ample proof to show that Karna signifies the desire or lust of the individual self.
    
- Karna was the Son of Surya. The root “sR-“ signifies movement and refers to transmigration. Thus, “Surya” refers to the karmas that cause transmigration and Karna is the lust of material objects born of these karmas.
    
- Karna was encased in golden armor and gold earrings. “Gold” signifies desire or rajo guṇa in the Upanishads as per “hiranmayena pātrena” ityādi.
    
- Karna is the oldest of the Pāndavas. Similarly, desire is higher than everything and is intrinsic to the self on account of being due to pūrva-janma vāsanās. That is evidenced by the following Gita shloka:
    

indriyāṇi parāṇyāhurindriyebhyaḥ paraṃ manaḥ।

manasastu parā buddhiryo buddheḥ paratastu saḥ। (Gīta 3.42)

Meaning:  The senses are higher than the sense-objects they are drawn towards. The mind is higher than the senses; for even if the senses are withdrawn from sense objects, the mind could continue to be immersed in sense objects. The intellect is higher than the mind, because even if the mind has been controlled, if the intellect is bent on pursuing sense objects, the mind will too. Desire is even higher than the intellect, because desire can disturb even the trained intellect.

Just as desire is higher to intellect, mind and senses, Karna was the oldest of the Pāndavas.

- Karna (desire) allied with Duryodhana (body) to fight against Yudhishthira (the self), Arjuna (mind) and Bhīma.
    
- Karna gave everything away in charity. Likewise, lust produces many objects of desire.
    
- Karna (lust) and Arjuna (meditating mind) were sworn enemies. This is clearly mentioned in the Gīta as well:
    

evaṃ buddheḥ paraṃ buddhvā saṃstabhyātmānamātmanā।

jahi śatruṃ mahābāho kāmarūpaṃ durāsadam।। (~Gita 3.43)।।

Meaning: O Mighty Armed! In this manner, knowing that desire which is higher than even the intellect and hence is capable of corrupting the intellect, and controlling the mind by focusing on karma yoga, destroy this enemy in the form of desire which is difficult to conquer!

- Here, Karna is indeed that “śatruṃ kāmarūpaṃ” who was difficult to conquer. Karna was described as a great warrior who was difficult to defeat even for the Gods. He managed to defeat Yudhishthira (self), Bhīma (meditation), Arjuna (mind), Nakula and Sahadeva (sama-dama guṇas) during the battle.
    
- Even Krishna was aware of Karna’s formidable strength and kept warning Arjuna. Thus, even bhagavān acknowledges lust as a great adversary and warns the mind to be cautious.
    
- When Karna employed his Sakti weapon on Ghatotkacha, Krishna was overjoyed, as he felt that the weapon would have killed Arjuna and now was expended on Ghatotkacha. As we saw earlier, Ghatotkacha represents selfless worship of the Lord that removes rajo and tamo guṇas which interrupt bhakti yoga. Such selfless worship (Ghatotkacha) takes away the power or effectiveness (sakti) of lust (Karna) which would otherwise have killed the mind (Arjuna). Thus, bhagavān was overjoyed.
    
- Thus, this enemy called desire is very powerful and difficult to defeat. Karna was defeated only after being weakened slowly by curses, by the removal of his golden armor and by the nullification of his Shakti Astra used in killing Ghatotkacha. In the same manner, the benedictions of Acharyas, the removal of the perception of pleasure in sense-objects (signified by removal of Karna’s golden armor) and selfless worship of the Lord will weaken desire for material objects.
    
- Meditating on Krishna, the mind (Arjuna) eventually overcame lust (Kama).
    

Final Summary of Bhakti Yoga

Having described bhakti yoga in its’ entirety, Karna now summarizes the whole process succinctly in the following shlokas.

1- Summary - Karma and Jnāna Yogas leading to Bhakti Yoga

yadā drakṣyasi māṃ kṛṣṇa nihataṃ savyasācinā

punaś citis tadā cāsya yajñasyātha bhaviṣyati

Meaning: O Krishna! When you see me killed by Arjuna, then will the piling up (punaściti) of this sacrifice take place.

Inner Meaning: O Lord who has a dark-blue complexion! When you see me (desire or lust), killed by the ambidextrous mind (savyasācin), then will the purifying contemplation on Brahman that is part of this bhakti yoga take place.

Points for Consideration:  

- This is the shloka summarizing the transition from karma and jnāna yogas to bhakti yoga proper.
    
- “Karna” refers to lust or desire.
    
- “savyasācin” – the mind which is ambidextrous in using the knowledge of the Upanishads to both withdraw the senses from sense objects (by karma yoga), and to focus the senses on meditation of the true nature of the self (jnāna yoga).
    
- The mind which is engaged in desireless action (karma yoga) and has a knowledge of the self being distinct from the body (jnāna yoga) destroys desire (Karna).
    
- “punaściti” – The meditation on Brahman, which is of a purifying nature as it destroys sins, will take place only when lust is eradicated.
    
- “Krishna” – Meditation on the bewitching dark-blue body of the Lord will destroy desire for other things. He is so attractive, after all.
    

2- Summary - Bhakti Yoga leading to Union with Brahman (by Meditation)

duḥśāsanasya rudhiraṃ yadā pāsyati pāṇḍavaḥ

ānardaṃ nardataḥ samyak tadā sutyaṃ bhaviṣyati

Meaning: When you see the son of Pandu (Bhīma) (drink the) blood of Duhshasana roaring (in anger) and shrieking (in agony) at the same time, then will the day of the extraction of Soma commence (in this sacrifice).

Inner Meaning: When you see the jīva (pāṇḍavaḥ) associated with sattva (experience) Brahman, the object of desire (rudhiraṃ) of the Vedas whose instructions are difficult to comprehend (duḥśāsana), that move in devotion towards Brahman (ānardaṃ), praising his auspicious attributes (nardataḥ), then will the union of the worshipper (with Brahman), take place.

Points for Consideration:

- This is the shloka summarizing the transition in various stages of bhakti yoga proper (para bhakti, para jnāna, parama bhakti).
    
- “rudhiraṃ” meaning “red” refers to passion or desire. It in turn implies Brahman who is the object of attainment and hence desired in the Vedas.
    
- “duḥśāsana” – the instructions (śāsana) that are difficult to comprehend or implement – they refer to the Vedas. The drinking is the experience of Brahman from these Vedas.
    
- “ānardaṃ” – The Vedas which move in devotion to Brahman, “nardataḥ” – The Vedas which praise his auspicious qualities upon experiencing them.
    
- “sutyaṃ” – “sut” means “stotr” – to praise. It refers to the worshipper. “yam” refers to joining. Thus, bhakti yoga or meditation leads to a union with Brahman in the sense of completely being absorbed in his auspicious qualities, to the exclusion of everything else.
    
- It should not be doubted that Duḥśāsana cannot refer to the Vedas because he was evil. The idea is, the Vedas are difficult to understand, and thus even they pose a hurdle. Furthermore, Duḥśāsana was originally named “Suḥśāsana” – auspicious instruction. Thus, the Vedas are actually auspicious instructions which appear difficult due to our own karmas at not being able to comprehend them.
    

3- Summary - Bhakti Yoga Interrupted by Prior Sins

As mentioned earlier, bhakti yoga, even when successfully established, undergoes a break due to transgressions arising from rajo and tamo guṇās.

yadā droṇaṃ ca bhīṣmaṃ ca pāñcālyau pātayiṣyataḥ

tadā yajñāvasānaṃ tad bhaviṣyati janārdana

Meaning:  When the two Pancālas take down Drona and Bhishma, then will be sacrifice reach a cessation, O Janārdana!

Inner Meaning: O Lord who protects people from the wicked (Janārdana)! When the two (rajo and tamo guṇās) that are associated with the embodied self that has doership (pāñcālyau), overthrow indifference to sense-objects (droṇaṃ) and meditation on the self that is death to sins obstructing bhakti yoga (bhīṣmaṃ), then the bhakti yoga shall reach a cessation or a break.

Points for Consideration:

- Yoga can be interrupted. “avasānaṃ” signifies a cessation in the form of a pause.
    
- “droṇaṃ” – “drumamayam” – wood like indifference to sense-objects due to desireless action (karma-yoga) stemming from understanding the nature of the self (jnāna-yoga).
    
- “bhīṣmaṃ” – “Death” – it signifies meditation on Brahman (bhakti-yoga) that destroys sins or samsāra – thus it is “death” to these sins.
    
- Both are interrupted by the effects of rajo and tamo guṇās still persisting which are called “pāñcālyau” as they are associated with the self called “pañcāla”  - pancha-alam – the competent self (as it has doership) associated with the body made of pancha-bhūtās is denoted by this.
    
- When such a break in Yoga happens, the Lord who protects the sādhus from the wicked is there to destroy the wicked guṇās that causes this pause. That is signified by “Janārdana”.
    

4- Summary – Successful Completion of Bhakti Yoga

duryodhanaṃ yadā hantā bhīmaseno mahābalaḥ  
tadā samāpsyate yajño dhārtarāṣṭrasya mādhava

Meaning: When the mighty Bhīmasena kills Duryodhana, then will sacrifice of Dhrtarashtra’s son be concluded, O Mādhava!

Inner Meaning: O Lord who is cognized by Mouna, Dhyāna and Yoga (Mādhava)! When the meditation on Brahman (Bhīmasena), powerful enough to destroy all sins (mahābalaḥ), kills or destroys the body (Duryodhana), then will this bhakti yoga of the jīva who is associated with the karmas that support the body (yajño dhārtarāṣṭrasya) be concluded.

Points for Consideration:

- As mentioned earlier, “Duryodhana” is one who fights in an evil manner” – the body which causes ahamkāra and mamakāra fights against the true nature of the self which is seshatva.
    
- Bhīma signifies meditation on Brahman which destroys all sins obstructing liberation, and hence destroys the body.
    
- “Dhārtarāṣṭrasya” - The self, which is associated with the karmas that support (dhrta) the body (rāṣṭra).
    
- And who is that Brahman who is directly perceived by such meditation? Is it Brahma, Rudra or Indra? No. It is the Lord Narayana denoted by “Mādhava” which means that he alone is seen through Mouna, Dhyāna  and Yoga. As per the following,
    

madhu vidyā avabodhatvāt dhāvatvāt-vā ṣriyo’niṣam ।

maunād-dhyānācca yogācca viddhi bhārata mādhavam || (Mahābhāratā 3.69.4)

5- Summary – Relinquishment of the Final Body by the Yogi (Death)

snuṣāś ca prasnuṣāś caiva dhṛtarāṣṭrasya saṃgatāḥ

hateśvarā hatasutā hatanāthāś ca keśava

gāndhāryā saha rodantyaḥ śvagṛdhrakurarākule

sa yajñe 'sminn avabhṛtho bhaviṣyati janārdana

Meaning: O Keśava! When the wives of the sons and grandsons of Dhrtarāshtra, assembled together, deprived of their husbands, and sons, devoid of their protectors, will lament along with Gandhari, amidst dogs, vultures and species of carnivorous birds, then the part of the sacrifice known as “avabhṛtha” (carrying off the utensils and casting them into the river, followed by the participants taking a bath) take place, O Janārdana!

Because this is a big shloka, we shall break this up sequentially and see its’ inner meaning as follows,

snuṣāś ca prasnuṣāś caiva dhṛtarāṣṭrasya saṃgatāḥ

hateśvarā hatasutā hatanāthāś ca keśava

Inner Meaning: O Master of Brahma and Rudra (Keśava)! When the sense organs like eye, ear etc etc (snuṣāś) and the senses that are prior to them such as the mind, buddhi etc (prasnuṣāś) of the self that supports the body (dhṛtarāṣṭrasya), are assembled together (at the time of death), deprived of their powers or abilities such as seeing, hearing, etc (hateśvarā), deprived of the effects or experiences they have such as color etc (hatasutā), deprived of the attachments that protect their continued functioning (hatanāthāś)

Points for Consideration:

- This describes the removal of the self from the body. Death is the final stage to attaining mukti via bhakti yoga. That it attains the Lord is indicated by the name “Keśava” which shows he is the master of Brahma and Rudra, and hence is to be attained.
    
- “dhṛtarāṣṭra” – refers to the self which is the support (dhṛta) of the body (rāṣṭra).
    
- “snuṣāś” – root is “snu” – to flow – the senses organs like eye which flow or proceed out to external objects. “prasnuṣāś”  refer to mind, buddhi etc that exist in front or prior to organs like the eye etc.
    
- “Iśvarā” – “Iśte iti Iśvarā” – It refers to power or capability of the senses like seeing etc.
    
- “sutā” – That which is begotten – the effects such as color, sound etc revealed by eye, ear etc.
    
- “nāthā” – Only attachments cause continued functioning of the senses.
    

gāndhāryā saha rodantyaḥ śvagṛdhrakurarākule

Inner Meaning:…(They) will weep along with the Mukhyaprāṇa (gāndhāryā saha), amidst the dogs, covetous ones (gṛdhra) and the grieving relatives (kurarākule)

Points for Consideration:

- “gāndhāryā” – gāna-dhārī – the vital breath that controls the other organs that support sound. Here “gāna” meaning sound denotes all the senses like sight, smell, sound etc.
    
- When it said that the organs weep, it is meant that they make the person dying weep, for insentient organs cannot weep.
    
- The dead body is left among dogs who crave for the bones, those people who covet the wealth of the dying (grdhra) and the clan of those who grieve (kurarākule)
    
- Here, “kurarākule” refers to those who grieve, as the texts often compare the cries of the Kurara bird to the tortured wails of women. “kula” signifies they are relatives or well-wishers as opposed to the other two types.
    

sa yajñe 'sminn avabhṛtho bhaviṣyati janārdana

Meaning:…Then will the removal (of the self from the final body upon death) in this sacrifice take place, O Lord who is the destroyer of births (Janārdana)!

Points for Consideration:

- “avabhṛtha” means removal of the self bound for moksha from the final body upon death.
    
- “Janārdana” is the Lord who destroys births for the bound selves, upon which the self attains liberation. Again, this name indicates he is the means, while the name of Keśava used in the beginning indicates that he is the end to be attained.
    

Thus, the Mahābhāratā is a historical war, and by the sankalpa of Bhagavān, also manifests in the form of a grand metaphor for bhakti yoga.

APPENDIX 1 – THE KILLING OF JARASANDHA AND THE ISAVASYA UPANISHAD

The episode of Bhīma killing Jarāsandha in the Mahābhāratā is a wonderful upabrahmaṇa of the Isavasya Upanishad mantra regarding Vidya and Avidya. Let us first see the relevant mantra in the Upanishad:

vidyam cavidyam ca yastadvedobhayam saha |

avidyaya mrtyum tirtva vidyaya'mrtamasnute  (~ Isa.Up 11)

Let us take a look at the three commentaries on this from dvaita, advaita and vishishtadvaita:

Dvaita Meaning: One who knows the correct knowledge (Vidya), and also criticizes false knowledge (Avidya), for him, by criticism of false knowledge which causes suffering (Avidya), he overcomes suffering (mrtyum tirtva), and by practice of correct knowledge which causes enjoyment (Vidya), he obtains mukti (Amrtam).

Advaita Meaning: He who knows the knowledge of the devas (Vidya) and the karmas such as agnihotra etc (Avidya), crosses over death which is the effect of prakrti (mrityum tirtva) by the karmas (Avidya) and becomes one with the devas (amrtam) by the knowledge of the devas (Vidya).

Vishishtadvaita Meaning: He who knows both Vidya (Meditation on Brahman) and avidya (the performance of duties which are accessory to meditation) together (as the angi, the main and the anga, the accessory), attains Brahman (amrta) through meditation (Vidya) by crossing over the beginningless karmas that obstruct such meditation called “death” (mrtyum tirtva) through the performance of dutiEs (Avidya).

According to the dvaitins, correct knowledge of Vishnu is Vidya and incorrect knowledge of Vishnu is Avidya. “Amrtam” refers to Moksha, “mrtyu” refers to suffering in samsāra.

According to the advaitins, the knowledge of the gods is Vidya and the karmas such as agnihotra are Avidya. This is as per the pramAṇa – “karmaṇa avidya” and “karma pitrloka vidya devaloka”. The fruit known as “amrta” here refers to attainment of the positions of these lesser gods like Hiranyagarbha and not the attainment of Paramatman. “mrtyum” refers to the activities of prakrti.

According to Vishishtadvaitins, the meditation (upāsaṇa) on Brahman is Vidya, and the karma yoga, performance of duties is Avidya. Amrta is liberation in the form of attainment of Bhagavan. “mrtyum” refers to the beginningless karmas that are obstacles to such meditation.

Who is right? One can get the right meaning by analyzing the incident of Jarasandha vadham. As Krishna says, “janma karma ca me divyam” – by understanding the leelas of the Lord, the meanings of the shāstra reveal themselves. As follows.

Firstly, Krishna approaches Yudhishthira, who was about to conduct the Rajasuya sacrifice and tells him the following:

natu śakyaṃ mahārāja jarāsaṃdhe mahābale |

rājasūyaṃ tvayā prāptuṃ tasmin jīvati pārthive || Adi — Mantraparva — 16–5 ||

Meaning: “O King (mahārāja)! It is not possible for you to perform the Rajasuya yajna when the powerful Jarasandha is still alive”

However, this shloka has a powerful inner meaning. Note that Yudhishthira is called “mahārāja”. The embodied Jīva is called “mahārāja” as it is the sovereign of the body, and is great as it is capable of doership. Hence, this is a name of the Jīva.

“Rājasūyaṃ” – Literally means “Birth of the Rāja”. But “sūyate” refers to the act of production, or in this context, making manifest. “Rāja” refers to the Supreme Lord who is the sovereign of all. Thus, it means “making the Supreme Lord manifest”, ie, perceiving him directly, which is the goal of Bhakti Yoga.

When one perceives the Lord at the culmination of Yoga, he dies immediately as he is sinless at that stage. Thus, this brahma-sākshātkāra, which leads to mukti the very next second, is not possible without getting rid of the karmas that bind one to the body.

Thus, we have “Jarāsaṃdha” – “That which unites Jarā (with the Jīvā)” – The beginningless karmas that unite the Self with the body which is called “Jarā” on account of being associated with old age, death etc (Note that by “Jarā”, even “marana” and other changes of the body is implied).

The true meaning of this shloka is as follows,

natu śakyaṃ mahārāja jarāsaṃdhe mahābale |

rājasūyaṃ tvayā prāptuṃ tasmin jīvati pārthive || Adi — Mantraparva — 16–5 ||

Meaning: “O Jīva, you who are the great sovereign of the body (mahārāja)! It is not possible for you to directly perceive the Supreme Brahman who is the Sovereign of all (the culmination of Bhakti Yoga) when the powerful karmas that unite the self with the body is still alive or existing in the embodied self (pārthive)”.

“jīvati pārthive” means the karmas still exist in the embodied self, which is associated with the body made of earthly elements. Note that Jarāsandha is mentioned to be harassing everyone. Similarly, these karmas cause himsa not only to the jīva, but to everyone else as the jīva tries to fulfill its’ attachments arising from the karmas.

Now, Krishna discusses the means to kill Jarāsandha. Having settled on the plan, Bhima tells everyone present the following,

kṛṣṇe nayo mayi balaṃ jayaḥ pārthe dhanañjaye |

māgadhaṃ sādhayiṣyāmo vayaṃ traya ivāgnayaḥ || Adi — Mantraparva — 17–10 ||

Meaning: “Krishna has the right tactics or policies (Naya). I have strength (Balam). Arjuna has victory (Jaya). The three of us — the three fires — can definitely win against the King of Magadha”

Note that Bhīma says Krishna has “Naya”. At this point, remember what the Isavasya Upanishad says:

agne naya supatha raye asman (Isa Up. 20)

Meaning: O Supreme Brahman who has Agni as his body! Lead us (naya) to the attainment of wealth (in the form of bhagavad jnāna and prāpti).

The Mahabharata is thus implying that Krishna is the Supreme Brahman with the quality of “Naya” or leading ability, who is referred to as “Agni” by the Isavasya. This unmistakeably proves that Krishna is the God of the Upanishad, and no other devata.

Then, Bhīma says he has “balam”. Strength is a metaphor for knowledge. Thus, “balam” corresponds with the term “Vidya” used by the Isavasya mantras. It is the meditation on Brahman, that leads to attainment of Brahman.

Regarding Arjuna, note a curious thing here. Bhima is the one who would fight and kill Jarāsandha. Then why is he saying Arjuna has “jaya” or victory? As below:

Arjuna is called “Dhananjaya” here – the gatherer or conqueror of wealth. What is this wealth? It is nothing but Jnāna and Vairagya, which are different kinds of wealth for Upāsakas. There are lots of things to develop Vairagya about, and various kinds of knowledge for different bhagavad-kalyāna-gunās.

This means that Arjuna signifies the performance of nitya-naimittika karmas with a desireless mind (Vairagya) and dedicating it to the Lord with clear knowledge of oneself as a sesha and the Lord as a seshi (Jnāna). And the performance of these duties attains “Jaya” or victory over the karmas that obstruct the commencement of Bhakti Yoga (Bhīma).

Note that Jarāsandha wanted to fight only Bhīma out of the three. This is because it is meditation (Bhīma) that directly burns away the karmas causing association with the body (Jarāsandha). However, to begin such meditation, we first have to destroy certain karmas that obstruct even that meditation.

Thus, in this particular context, Arjuna signifies “Avidya” or desireless performance of duties as mentioned in the Isavasya, which conquers the karmas obstructing meditation on Brahman, and allows meditation (Bhīma) to commence and succeed in destroying the karmas obstructing liberation (Jarāsandha). Thus, Bhīma said that Arjuna was the one with the victory.

Thus, the true meaning of the shloka is as follows:

kṛṣṇe nayo mayi balaṃ jayaḥ pārthe dhanañjaye |

māgadhaṃ sādhayiṣyāmo vayaṃ traya ivāgnayaḥ || Adi — Mantraparva — 17–10 ||

Meaning: “Krishṇa is the Supreme Brahman who has the ability to lead the Jīva (Yudhishthira) to success in Upāsana (Naya). I (Bhīma), the meditation undertaken in Bhakti Yoga by the Jīvā (Yudhishthira), have strength which is the capability to burn away karmas obstructing liberation (Jarāsandha). Arjuna is the performance of nitya-naimittika karmas devoid of desire for the fruits that has victory over the karmas obstructing meditation (Bhīma). The three of us — like three fires — can definitely win against the karmas that are associated with movement in samsara (māgadhaṃ)”

“māgadhaṃ” – The karmas which support the body. The body is called “Magadha” as it is “ma-gata-dhāra” – that which which sustains the movement of the Jivā signified by “ma” in samsāra. Thus, “māgadhaṃ” is that which is associated with this body and refers to the karmas only. It is another name for Jarāsandha.

“traya ivāgnayaḥ” can be interpreted as “We – the Supreme Brahman who leads or guides the Yogi, the meditation on Brahman’s auspicious attributes and the performance of karmas as accessory to meditation – are like the three fires as we burn away the karmas”.

And now, let us look at the Isavasya Upanishad again and interpret that mantra in the light of this incident:

vidyam cavidyam ca yastadvedobhayam saha |

avidyaya mrtyum tirtva vidyaya'mrtamasnute  (~ Isa.Up 11)

Meaning: He who knows both Vidya (Bhīma/Meditation on Brahman) and avidya (Arjuna/the karmas which are accessory to meditation) together (as the angi, the main and the anga, the accessory), attains Brahman known as “amrta” (Krishṇa) through meditation (Bhīma/Vidya) by crossing over the beginningless karmas that obstruct such meditation, called “death” (mrtyum tirtva) through the performance of desireless action (Arjuna/Avidya).

In this manner, deep meanings of bhakti yoga are embedded everywhere in the Mahābhārata.

APPENDIX 2 – THE 18 PARVAS OF THE MAHABHARATA

If we look at the names of the 18 parvas in the Mahābhārata, we can easily discern the undercurrent of bhakti yoga.

- Adi Parva – The beginning, or the birth of the self when it acquires a body based on karmas. The key event is the birth of the Pandavas.
    
- Sabha Parva – The experiences of the embodied self in “sabha” or samsara which is an assembly of elements. The self suffers from dangers like kāma, krodha etc. This parva has the incident of Draupadi (the self) suffering in the hall (samsara) due to Kauravas (dangers of samsara) when her 5 husbands (panchendriyas) forsake her.
    
- Vana Parva – The desire of the self for moksha. “vana” means desire. As the Pandavas wandered the forest seeking the advice of wise rishis, so does the suffering self wander the Vedas seeking a remedy for samsara, desirous of moksha. “Vana” can also refer to the Vedas and thus, the seeker of moksha studies the Vedas, seeks advice from Acharyas, etc to understand their true nature.
    
- Virata Parva – “Virata” means to desist from something. The renunciation of material attachments and desires by the self upon understanding the ephemeral nature of samsara. As the Pandavas hid from the Kauravas in the final year of their exile, so does the self, in the final births prior to moksha, hide from the dangers of samsara by being devoid of attachments.
    
- Udyoga Parva – “Udyoga” means effort. The effort undertaken by Bhagavān to set the sAttvic seeker on the right path, as evidenced by Bhagavān going to the Kauravas, Karna etc as a messenger. When the yogi is desirous of moksha and resorts to the Vedas and Acharyas, then Bhagavān bestows his favor on him (jnāna dīpena bhāsvata – Gīta).
    
- Bhishma Parva – “Bhishma” means death. The performance of karma yoga, desireless action by dedicating fruits of nitya-naimittika karmas, results in “death” of the sins that obstruct meditation on the self. Thus, it refers to successful completion of karma yoga. As Bhishma was the central focus of the parva, this period of Yoga is characterized by a focus to destroy the karmas obstructing jnAna yoga.
    
- Drona Parva – “Drona” means wood (drumamayam) and refers to indifference to material objects, to pain and pleasure etc just as a lump of wood feels nothing. It refers to the successful completion of jnana-yoga, and understanding the true nature of the imperishable self in comparison to perishable material objects. This destroys sins obstructing bhakti yoga. As Drona was the central focus of the parva, this period of Yoga is characterized by a focus to understand the true nature of the self and destroy karmas obstructing bhakti yoga.
    
- Karna Parva – “Karna” means “that which steers” or “that which is at the helm” – it refers to the meditation on Brahman or bhakti yoga proper, which is the principal as compared to karma and jnana yoga which are accessories. Such meditation steers the Jiva towards destruction of sins obstructing liberation. As Karna was the central focus of the parva, this period of Yoga is characterized by a meditation on the auspicious attributes of Brahman upon understanding one’s nature to develop a love for bhagavAn.
    
- Shalya Parva – The period of lapse in Yoga. “Shalya” means “fault” and refers to the Yogi temporarily lapsing back into samsāric attachments due to his vAsaNAs being strong, with rajo and tamo gunas predominating him. As Shalya was the central focus of the parva, this period of Yoga is characterized by an interruption in Yoga.
    
- Sauptika Parva – The period of Yoga pertaining to inactivity of the rajo and tamo guṇās. By virtue of selfless worship of the Lord, the Yogi has conquered his rajo and tamo guṇās which caused a lapse in the yoga. “Sauptika” means related to inactivity or a numbing – it refers to the rajo and tamo guṇās becoming dormant again.
    
- Stri Parva – The period of Yoga when the realization of the Sesha-Seshi bhāva is at its’ mature stage. The bhakti yogi now has developed a love for Bhagavan and recognizes the Lord as his master and himself as the servant, and considers himself to be as dependent as a wife (strI) on her husband. Bhartru- Bhārya sambandha also exists between the Lord and the Jīvās, as one can see with the gopīs and Krishna. Here it must be noted how this exposes the ignorance Veerashaivas who being filled with dvesha and completely incapable of understanding this lofty tattva, cast aspersions on the Lord and claim rAsa leela was adhArmic.
    
- Shanti Parva – Self-explanatory. The Yogi now has peace from the vicissitudes of samsara as he is now engaged in joyous meditation on bhagavān, such contemplation being of the form of love.
    
- Anushasana Parva – The period in which the Yogi, having realized his true nature of seshatvam and experiencing immense love for bhagavān, now lives solely for the sake of bhagavān, always acting in accordance to the wishes of bhagavān. “anu” means “following or agreeable to” and “Shasana”  means “command” – thus, being agreeable to or following the Vedas which are the command of the Lord.
    
- Ashvamedhika Parva – The offering of horses (Ashwamedha) – where horses signify the senses. The Yogi, now having his devotion increased manifold by Yoga, now performs services for bhagavān, engaging all his indrīyās in kāiyika, vācaka and mānasīka kainkaryas (services by body, speech and mind).
    
- Ashramavasika Parva – In the Gita, Shri Krishna declares “bahunām janmanam ante jnānavan mam prapadyate” – “After many auspicious births of bhakti yoga, the jnAni performs sharanAgati to me”. The Vishnu Sahasranama contains the name “Ashrama” and refers to the ability of Sriman Narayana to provide a place of rest (Ashrama) – This resting place is nothing but birth in a noble, devoted Sri Vaishnava family where true knowledge can be obtained and Yogis whose Yoga have been interrupted, will feel refreshed. Thus, “Ashramavasika” refers to the Yogi being born into a noble family  conducive for him to foster exclusive devotion to and perform śaranāgati to the Lord, with his Yoga now proceeding to completion. It is the final auspicious birth that leads to moksha.
    
- Mausala Parva – Pertaining to maces. “Musala” means “mace” signifying strength or intellect. “Mausala” refers to fighting with mace --- destroying the remaining karmas impeding moksha with intellect that is the Chaitanya krt prapatti. The Lord burns away the karmas for such a person, as Shri Krishna himself oversaw the destruction of the Yadus.
    
- Mahaprasthānika Parva – The great departure of the self from the body, ie, death of the final body.
    
- Svargarohana Parva – The ascent to Paramapada or Sri Vaikunta denoted by “Svarga” upon death via the archirādi gati, also called devāyana.
    

In this manner, the Mahābhārata is wholly dedicated to expounding the rāja vidyā  of bhakti yoga.

In the next part of this series, we will take a look at Shiva’s praise of Krishna in the Harivamsha and the worship of Shiva by Ashvattama in the Sauptika Parva.



#### Undersetanding the Mahabharata - Part 2

INTRODUCTION

In the second part of the Mahabharata series, we will take up 3 sections which elaborate the nature of the Supreme Being (Vishnu), the nature of the realized, subservient self (Shiva) and the nature of the means (PancarAtra). 

The section describing the nature of the supreme being is the praise of Krishna by Shiva in the Harivamsha. When Shiva arrives at the spot where Krishna is performing penances for progeny, he immediately extols Krishna as the Supreme Being. We have provided a translation of this section, as the first part of the article.

The section describing the nature of the subservient self is provided in Ashwattama’s praise of Shiva enshrined in the Sauptika Parva. Ashwattama invokes Shiva to accomplish his end (the destruction of the Pandavas) and for this purpose, he embarks on a magnificent stuti of Shiva that clearly illustrates his true nature. Out of all the Shiva stutis present in the texts, this one composed by Ashwattama can be considered to be the most precise one in describing the nature of Shiva in a clear manner.

The final section is taken from the Santi Parva and describes the greatness of the pAncarAtra Agama which is the means to attain the Lord. In the course of this description, the section also compares and contrasts the Shaiva Agamas and elaborates the true nature of the tattvas associated with such veda-bAhya darshanas.

We will begin with the first section described previously above and proceed in that order.

HARIVAMSHA - SHIVA’S RECOGNITION OF SRI KRISHNA AS THE SUPREME BEING

tato vR^iShadhvajo devaH shUlI sAkShAdumApatiH |  
karaM kareNa saMspR^ishya viShNoshchakradharasya ha ||3-88-1

Meaning: Thence, the bearer of the flag with the emblem of a bull, the resplendent wielder of trident, none other than the consort of Uma himself, touched the hand of Vishnu the bearer of sudarshana chakra with his own hand.

The bull signifies Dharma. The shUla signifies he is the destroyer of triguNAs that are like asurAs. He is the Lord of Uma, who is renowned for her knowledge. 

Krishna possesses the Sudarshana Chakra which flies faster than wind and unfailingly arrives very swiftly to rescue his devotees. The point is that, Krishna fulfills the desires of his devotees very quickly, thus he quickly fulfilled Shiva’s desire that he worship the latter and give him the status of boon-giver. Like the unfailing Chakra, the Lord’s fulfilment of his promise to Shiva is also unfailing.

provAcha bhagavAnrudraH keshavaM garuDadhvajam |  
shR^iNvatAM sarvadevAnAM munInAM bhAvitAtmanAm ||3-88-2

Meaning: Rudra who possesses knowledge related to the universe, beings, and wisdom (bhagavAn) told Keshava, who bears the Garuda insignia on his flag, having discerned the question in the minds of the all devas, sages, and the devotees who were listening there.

The gods, rishis and others who had gathered there had harbored doubts about the supremacy of Vishnu on seeing him propitiate Shiva. Thus, the omniscient Mahadeva, whose role is to guide the lesser beings towards Brahman, knew of their doubts and sought to resolve them quickly.

Shiva’s request to Krishna that he be worshipped by the latter need not to be construed as an act of ego. Shiva knew that the lesser devas and even the Asuras like Banasura needed his guidance for protection and gaining knowledge of Hari. To be in a position to impart such guidance, he needed recognition as a competent boon-giver. Thus, he sought Hari to worship him, thereby giving him this status.

shR^iNu tatrApi bhagavankAraNaM kAraNAtmaka ||3-88-5

Meaning: “What is this, Oh Lord of Brahma who is the lord of all devas, Oh bearer of Sudarshana chakra, Oh protector of people from the asurAs/karmas (janArdana)? Why do you perform these austerities? What is it that you seek from me? Indeed, you are Vishnu the Eternal, the austerity of all austerities, Oh Hari! If your prayer is for begetting a son O Janardana, I have already given a son to you long back. Oh One who has the nature of being the means (kAraNAtmaka) , Oh possessor of six auspicious attributes (bhagavAn), listen to what caused that particular incident.

“ChakrapAne” signifies he destroys the wicked. “janArdana” means he protects his devotees from the wicked karmas by showing his presence. This is “sAdhu paritrANAm” and “vinAsAya ca duskrtAm”.

“kAraNam” signifies “instrument” as in “means”. His nature is to be the means to all ends, hence he is “kAraNAtmaka”. Thence Shiva is saying in awe, “You who are the means to everything, are considering me as a means to attain something? Your sousIlya (lowering his status to mingle with lesser people) has no limits!”.

Meaning: “During the krtayuga, for some particular reason, I was engaged in a difficult penance for a ten thousand years. At that time, bhavAnI came to offer services to me. This umA of beautiful splendor was sent there by her father.

Meaning: “Indra, who was frightened due to my penance at that time, sent the god of love (mAra = manmatha) to me (in order to disturb my penances). He then shot an arrow aimed at me. She (umA) was propitiating me with offerings of flowers, Oh Lord Hari!

Meaning: “At that time, I became angry, seeing the god of love in that manner. Because of that, fire emanated from my (third) eye and fell. Oh Hari! That fire burned manmatha and turned him into ashes. Then, I thought about this act of Indra, Oh Vishnu!

Meaning: “From then on, I started having compassion towards him (the god of love). I am also directed by brahmA, having become pleased. Oh Janardana! He is now appointed to be your son, Oh resplendent one! Oh Lord of the Universe! He is your elder son, widely celebrated as Pradyumna. Know that he is indeed the god of love, Oh Lord of the Devas, there is no doubt in it.”

Note that “isam kamalAsanasthaM” in the gIta is explained clearly here by “brahmaNA cha niyukto.asmi” - Shiva, who abides (sthaM) by the directions of Brahma (kamalAsana).

Meaning: Having spoken thus so far, venerable (sattamaH) Rudra spoke again as follows, showing the essential truth to the sages who were desirous of listening. Rudra held his palms together to propitiate Vishnu in anjali mudra, with Parvati occupying one half of his body, desirous of explaining the real essence. When Hara acted thus, the sages, devas, gandharvas, siddhas, and kinnaras joined him with palms together propitiating Lord Vishnu - Hari - the Lord of the best of the devas.

In the gIta, Sri Krishna explains that one follows what jnAnIs and mahAtmas do. Thus, the rishis, devas etc followed Rudra’s lead in propitiating Vishnu.

Meaning: Maheshvara spoke as follows: “That which the sAMkhyas speak of as the Cause is known as Prakriti. From it, the principle called Mahan, whose cause is the Prakriti, is born. The Pradhana that is the (material) cause is of threefold nature, and is the source of the universe. Oh Vishnu! Its three qualities are sattva, rajas, and tamas. It forms the cosmic egg, from which the universe is born. It is verily you, Janardana! 

sharIrAtma bhAva is used here to equate the Universe with Vishnu. This is so for succeeding verses as well.

Meaning: Indeed, from that (the pradhAna or mUlaprakR^iti) which is great and frightful (ghora), the principle called “mahAn” was born. That mahAn which was formed at the beginning of creation is indeed You, Jagannatha!  From its modification, the great causes known as the “tanmAtras” (five in number) and the panchabhUtas were born.

Meaning: You indeed, the Lord, are those gross elements (and the tanmAtras), Lord of the Universe! The bhUtas are enumerated as: Earth, Wind, Sky, Water, and Fire. The tanmAtras are: sight, smell, touch, taste, and sound. The sixth, which is the mind, is you as well Oh Radiant Lord! It is the stimulator leading to various experiences.

Meaning: You, the self-controlled one alone, Oh Janardana, create the other karmendriyas such as speech. Likewise Oh Lord of the Universe, you have given fitness (to be the objects of enjoyment), which are the path leading the indriyas into, in the respective objects of enjoyment.

Meaning: When you are endowed with the quality of rajas, you are creating beings. When you are endowed with the quality of sattva, you become the protector of the three worlds. When you are endowed with the quality of tamas, you annihilate the universe. You are endowed with the three gunas for the purpose of creation, preservation, and annihilation.

Meaning: Bringing along the three types of wealth, you are present (inside the bodies of living beings) engaging the sense-organs in their respective objects. In order that living beings can enjoy (ie, experience), you exist inside them, Oh Preceptor of all as you are the source of all knowledge  (Jagadguru). Hence, you exist inside all beings and are the enjoyer of all objects.

Meaning: You are Brahma during the time of creation. You are Vishnu during the time of protection. You possess the name of Rudra during annihilation. You are shining in the three regions, Oh Lord.

Meaning: The five elements (earth, water, fire, air, sky) as well as the mind and intellect are your various natures present everywhere.

In the next few shlokas, Rudra himself shows that the Purusha Sukta sings the glory of Sriman Narayana, who is standing before his eyes.

tvamevedaM jagatsarvaM yadbhUtaM yadbhaviShyati |  
tvatto virATprAdurabhUtsamrATchaiva janArdana ||3-88-35

Meaning: The Purusha is of thousand heads, eyes, and feet. He is of thousand streams (of knowledge), possesses a thousand (rays in the form of sun, moon etc), has a thousand bodies, and is the Lord of the effulgent Paramapada. (This Purusha is none but you, hence I say the following). You  indeed are this universe in its entirety, whatever existed, and whatever will exist. From you alone, Virat (Aniruddha) was born and thus was Samrat (four-faced Brahma, who was born from Anirudddha), Oh Janardana!

“Thousand” refers to infinite or too numerous to count here. Knowledge is like a stream that proceeds forward from him. He reveals the Veda and other shAstrAs by his knowledge. He has a thousand bodies, meaning, everything is his body, including the unique forms assumed by him which are endless.

Meaning: From your face, Oh Ancient One, the Brahmana who is the protector of the worlds and ever satisfied with six duties (learning the Vedas, teaching them, performing Yajnas, assisting in the performance of Yajnas, giving dAna and receiving it), was born. From the two shoulders, the Kshatriya fond of protecting and defending was born. From the chest, the Vaishya was born. From the feet of you, who is Vishnu, was the Sudra born. Hence, Oh Janardana, the four Varnas were born from your body.

Meaning: Oh Lord of the Devas, the moon was born from your mind. The moon gives comfort to all living beings, possessing cool rays and abundant illumination. From your eyes, the sun was born. This sun oversees all living beings, the whole world is illuminated by him, and is luminous. Indra and Agni were born from your mouth. From your breath, Vayu was born. Space was born from your abdomen, oh Janardana! Oh Lord of Speech (i.e., Vedas) the celestial realm that is terrible (by its’ effulgence and unapproachability to the asuras) was born from your head.

Meaning: From your feet, the earth was born. The directions were born of your ears, Oh Lord of the Universe! Having created the entire universe thus, you entered everything, entered all the worlds, and exist everywhere, Oh Keshava! Hence, you are known by the name “Vishnu” as well as due to the visibility of your pervasiveness in all substances.

Having described Sriman Narayana as the pratipAdya devatA of Purusha Sukta, Maheshvara next explains the meanings of some of his names:

nArA ApaH samAkhyAtAstAsAmayanamAditaH |  
yatastvaM bhUtabhavyesha tannArAyaNashabditaH ||3-88-44

Meaning: The waters are called “nAras”. Since from the beginning you are their refuge, you are known as “Narayana” Oh Lord of the past and the future!

harasi prANino deva tato haririti smR^itaH |  
sha~Nkaro.asi sadA deva tataH sha~NkaratAM gataH ||3-88-45

Meaning: You annihilate all beings, and hence you are remembered as “Hari”. You are ever “Shankara” (one who generates ‘shaM’ or auspiciousness) and hence you possess that nature.

hR^iShIkANIndriyANyAhusteShAmIsho yato bhavAn |  
hR^iShIkeshastato viShNo khyAto deveShu keshava ||3-88-47

Meaning: Because you are great, and you make anything connected to you great, you are known as “Brahma”. The sense organs are known as “madhu” and hence you are known as “madhunishudana” (one who subdues the senses). The sense organs are also known as “Hrishikas”. Since you are their Lord, Oh Keshava, Oh Vishnu, you are known as “Hrishikesha” among the devas.

ka iti brahmaNo nAma Isho.ahaM sarvadehinAm |  
AvAm tavA~NgasaMbhUtau tasmAtkeshavanAmavAn ||3-88-48

Meaning: “Ka” is the name of Brahma. I am the “Isha” or the controller of all those who are embodied. The two of us (Brahma and I, Maheshvara) are born from your limbs and hence you are known as “Keshava”.

gaureShA tu yato vANI tAM cha veda yato bhavAn |  
govindastu tato deva munibhiH kathyate bhavAn ||3-88-50

Meaning: The word “mA” means knowledge, Oh Hari! Since you are the lord of knowledge, you are known as “mAdhava”. There, the meaning of the term “dhava” is “svAmI” or Lord. The name “go” refers to speech. Since you are the knower of speech, you are known as “Govinda” by the seers.

trirityeva trayo devAH kIrtitA munisattamaiH  |  
kramate tAMstathA sarvAstrivikrama iti shrutaH ||3-88-51

Meaning: The three devas are known as “tri” by the most excellent of Munis. Since you surpass all of them, you are known as “trivikrama”.

This is a name unique to Krishna-avatAra. In this avatAra, the Lord subdued Indra in his acquisition of the pArijata, Brahma when the latter stole his calves and Shiva during the fight against bAnasura. He thus asserted his supremacy over all three devas who acknowledged it.

aNurvAmananAmAsi yatastvaM vAmanAkhyayA |  
mananAnmunirevAsi yamanAdyatiruchyase ||3-88-52

Meaning: You are known as “vAmana” since you are subtle (pervading even the subtle self). You are known as “muni” since you are engaged in contemplation (ever focused on how to deliver all living beings).

tapashcharasi yasmAttvaM tapasvIti cha shabditaH |  
vasanti tvayi bhUtani bhUtAvAsastato hare ||3-88-53

IshastvaM sarvabhUtAnAmIshvaro.asi tato hare |

Meaning: You perform austerities (i.e., display the qualities of saulabhyam and saushilyam for the welfare of your devotees) hence you are known as “tapasvI”. The beings dwell in you, hence you are known as “bhUtAvAsas”.

Next, Shiva reiterates the contents of the Vibhuti Yoga chapter of the Gita, describing Krishna as the possessor of all the vibhUtis:

Meaning: (1) Among the Vedas, you are the praNavAkAra. (2) Among the metres, you are the Gayatri metre. (3) Among the letters, you are the “akAra”. (4) Among the Rudras, you are my very own self. (5) Among the Vasus, you are Agni. (6) Among the trees, you are “ashvattha”. (7) You are the Brahma the Guru to the universe. (8) Among the mountains, you are Meru. (9) Among the devarshis, you are Narada. (10) Among the Danavas, you are the daitya prahlAda. You show mercy to your devotees. (11) Among the snakes, you are the one known as “vAsuki”. (12) Among the guhyakas (hidden beings such as Yakshas), you are the giver of wealth i.e. Kubera. (13) Among the marine beings, I am Varuna. (14) You are the river Ganga, one that partakes in the three paths.

You are the origin of all beings, their middle and their end. From you, the universe originates and everything dissolves into you.

tvadupAsA jagannAtha saivAstu mama gopate |  
yashcha tvAM dveShTi devesha sa mAM dveShTi na saMshayaH ||3-88-62

Meaning: I am yourself, who exist everywhere, oh effulgent one. I am indeed you, oh Janardana. Between the two of us, there is no difference by word or meaning (which extend to my antaryAmin by virtue of body-soul relationship), oh Lord who possesses the universe as his body (jagatpate). Oh Govinda, your great names that are well-known in this world alone are my names. There is no doubt in this. May worship that is directed to you be mine, Oh Lord of speech! There is no doubt that one who hates you hates me as well.

Having mentioned that everything including himself is a vibhUti of krishna, Shiva proceeds to elaborate the reason why he and everything else is a vibhUti (property) of the Lord. It is because everything is his body. 

Thus, this shloka, a logical conclusion of the previous, is not a declaration of identity. Note that Shiva says “I am you who exist everywhere” -- thus the precondition of the lord existing everywhere (pervading everything just as the Atma pervades the body) is added prior to a declaration of oneness “I am You”. Similarly, Arjuna says in the gIta, “As you pervade everything, you ARE everything!”. The self pervades a body, by virtue of that, whatever name denotes the body, denotes the self. Similarly, the Lord pervades everything, thus the entity “Shiva” who is pervaded by the Lord, refers to the Lord.

Indeed, even Shiva says here that there is no difference \*by word or meaning\* -- implying that everything in its’ ultimate connotation denotes the Lord who has everything as his body and inheres as the Self. Shiva does not say there is no difference at all between the 2 entities.

On account of this body-self relationship, Shiva beseeches the Lord, “Let your worship be mine”. “Mine” here denotes the indwelling Lord. Thus, Shiva wants Krishna to ensure everyone prays to Krishna through Shiva, ie, worships the indweller of Shiva. This way, Shiva becomes the devata for granting boons, which was the initial purpose of Krishna worshipping him.

Note that Shiva says, “whoever hates you, hates me”. This is because “me” here denotes the innerself of Shiva. The idea is that, those who worship Shiva and hate Hari, it makes their worship of Shiva futile as well, since that worship only reaches the indweller of Shiva who is Hari himself. By this, Shiva is clarifying that his indweller is the same as Krishna and it is not possible to worship him independently, while hating Krishna.

Finally, note that Shiva does not say “Those who hate me, hate you”. This is because it is quite possible to hate Shiva, and yet be inclined to worship Vishnu. Of course, hating Shiva is a dosha which will eventually be corrected by the Lord, but it does not harm the worship of the Supreme Lord Vishnu which is unaffected by anything and independent of Shiva. In contrast, it is not possible to hate Vishnu and progress in worship of Shiva, since Shiva is dependent on his indweller to whom all worship goes. This alone shows that identity is not the intent of Shiva’s words here!

yadAsIdvartate yachcha yachcha bhAvi jagatpate |  
sarvaM tvameva devesha vinA kiMchittvayA na hi ||3-88-64

Meaning: Your (attribute of) spreading out in all objects (pervading them), is the reason why I am the Lord of the embodied beings (bhUtAs). Nothing that is separated from you can exist. That which was, which is, and which will be, Oh Lord of the universe, are all indeed you. Without you, there is nothing.

Shiva acknowledges that the Lord pervades everything, and that is the reason for Shiva’s exalted status (ie, he is an Avesha avatAra empowered by his indweller).

Here, Shiva clarifies very clearly that nothing can exist \*separate\* from the Lord. Meaning, everything is dependent on him as the body is dependent on the self. Thus, any lingering notion of identity is dispelled.

The past, present and future are all him as he is “sarvabhUtAntarAtma”. Again, only the antaryAmi principle is alluded to by this, since it is not otherwise possible for the Lord to be things which will arise in the future.

Meaning: What is there to be said by me, Oh effulgent one! Everything is you, creator of beings! I salute you entirely, Oh Vishnu, Oh Madhava, Oh Keshava. I salute you, the universal soul, and may all salutations be unto you, Oh Hari! Salutations, one with a lotus in the navel. I worship you, Oh Lord!

Meaning: Having spoken as above to the Lord of the deva of the devas, Shiva said thus to the sages: “Oh learned ones, who are devoted, and have come here to spectate, know thus--”

Meaning: This Lord Krishna is the highest object of attainment. There is no higher (object to be attained) than that. Understand it (the highest entity) as your highest austerity (or knowledge). Oh learned ones, this entity is the one to be meditated by meditators. This entity is your highest welfare, and is your highest wealth.

Meaning: This entity is also the duty of your birth, ie, your birth attains fruition only after gaining knowledge of him. It is the fruit of any austerity, ie, he grants the fruits of all austerities, or he himself is the highest fruit. This Lord is the abode of auspicious attributes called “puNyaH” as they purify (punAti iti puNyaH). He is the supreme means to liberation, eternally associated with a divine form (which is the means as it is meditated on). This nArAyaNa is the giver of moksha, and he is indeed said to be the one sought after by the wise (mArgyatE iti mArgaH).  This nArAyaNa is the one who bestows “puNya” or purity as he purifies even the asurAs and makes them worthy of worship. He is verily the fruit of all karmas.

Meaning: Understand this lord thus. There is no room for any further enquiry. Hari alone is to be meditated upon by you all, who are established in sattva. There is no other deva in the universe higher than Vishnu - Narayana. By the praNava mantra (“Om”) you must always recite and meditate Keshava.

 By using the phrase “ no other deva”, Shiva makes it very clear that he himself is not higher than the Supreme Lord Narayana.

Meaning: From this upAsana of Hari, arises welfare. There is no doubt in it. Upon being worshipped by you, Lord Hari will be pleased with you. This Lord Hari will firmly destroy the cycle of births. Oh learned ones, if you wish to attain your desires, always meditate on Hari who is Achyuta.

Meaning: This lord destroys the vastness of the Samsara. Always remember Vishnu, and recite the possessor of three bodies. Oh learned ones, with great effort you must always control your mind. When the mind is purified, Vishnu the wealth of all austerities, becomes benevolent.

Meaning: Having meditated upon me using all efforts, you must then know Keshava. I am forever to be worshipped, wise ones. I am proclaimed to be worshipped in (as in, one of the vibhUtis of) Lord Hari. I have also declared that there is no doubt that this is the means. He (Lord Vishnu) is the possessor of prakrti known as mAyA, oh wise ones. May you strive for the destruction of sins (in the aforementioned way).

Note: In the second line above, the version favoured by our AchArya \[shrutaprakAshika bhaTTar in the Tatparya Dipika commentary to Sri Ramanuja’s Vedartha Samgraha\] is different, and goes as: “upAsyo.ahaM sadA viprA upAyo.asmi hareH smR^itau” meaning, “Oh wise ones, I am always to be worshipped, (since) I am the means for Hari in the utterances of sages”. Pramanas like “Jnanam icchet maheshvarAt” are discussed in the same context (see [here](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A0%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D:%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%99%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%83.pdf/%E0%A5%A9%E0%A5%A8%E0%A5%AF)). 

These lines do not attribute supremacy to Shiva, but either ordains his worship for Bhakti Yogis as a means to know about Hari, or as a limb of Hari’s upAsana in seeing Shiva as a vibhUti of Vishnu.

Meaning: Just as your intellect becomes complete and pure by effort, oh foremost of the wise, may you endeavour in the same manner. By this, the effulgent one (Hari) becomes merciful (to you all).

Meaning: (Vaishampayana continues to narrate the incident). Have been spoken thus, the sages who are endowed with good deeds understood the real nature (of Brahman Sriman Narayana) and got cleared of their doubts. With palms held together, they agreed with Hara. They said: “All our doubts are dispelled, and we have grasped the meanings as they are.”

It is not that the sages, being great jnAnIs themselves, ever had a doubt in the first place. This is enacted for our sake. Also, it can also be said that despite knowing everything themselves, the rishis realize that such knowledge is useless unless they formally hear it from a guru, and thus they wanted Mahadeva as their guru to explain everything.

Meaning: (The sages continued speaking to Shiva): “For this purpose, we had assembled here on your premises. By the meeting of the two of you (Shiva and Vishnu), our great delusion stands destroyed. Whatever you say, oh Lord of the devas, that is indeed the highest for our welfare. Just as Bhagavan Rudra said, we will constantly strive for devotion to Hari.” Thus the sages, who were pleased, saluted Hari, who is Keshava.

Meaning: On account of that (the words of the rishis), Bhagavan Rudra to everyone’s admiration, started eulogising Vishnu, the Lord of the universe, Hari. During that time, (the Lord was praised) in the same manner by the words of the sages who were listening.

“sarvAnvismApayanniva” implies that the listeners admired the lucidity of speech, knowledge and devotion of Rudra which are the hallmarks of one well-versed in the Vedas and quite rare.

Meaning: Maheshvara said: “Salutations to you, oh Bhagavan! Unto you who are Vasudeva the wise. Salutations always unto you, oh Achyuta, who are the in-dweller of the Sun that illuminates the entire world with its light. Salutations to you, who are Bhagavan, who is effulgent. Salutations always unto Vishnu the effulgent who is the in-dweller of the moon that cools the world with its cooling rays.”

These set of verses praise the Lord as the indweller of all. Note that this is strikingly similar to the set of mantras in the Atharvasiras beginning with “yo vai rudraH sa bhagavAnyashcha brahmA tasmai vai namonamaH…” which praise the indweller of each deva and identify it with the indweller of Rudra. This again shows that Vishnu alone is the referrant of the Atharvasiras.

They felt the greatest awe and were satisfied that they had succeeded. The devatas who had assembled there, saluted Vishnu/Hari joyfully and then attained their respective abodes along with their attendants.

SAUPTIKA PARVA – ASHVATTAMA’S PRAYERS TO RUDRA

In the Sauptika Parva of the Mahābhārata, it is described that Ashvattama prayed to Rudra for the destruction of the Pandavas. His eulogy of Rudra is probably the most comprehensive of all Shiva-Stutis in clarifying the nature of Rudra, hence we decided to comment on it here. 

Though Ashvattama was consumed by tamo-guṇa, he was born a brāhmaṇa and hence retained some knowledge. He was well aware of the supremacy of Krishna, and the status of Rudra, but compelled by his karma, he proceeded to act against the wishes of Krishna. For this, he sought the assistance of Rudra as below.

so 'ham adya mahādevaṃ prapadye śaraṇaṃ prabhum

Meaning: I shall therefore, now, seek the protection of Mahādeva, who is most powerful as he can bestow desirable boons (prabhum)

daivadaṇḍam imaṃ ghoraṃ sa hi me nāśayiṣyati

Meaning: He will destroy this terrible rod of punishment belonging to the Supreme God, Krishna which is intended for me. 

“daivadaṇḍam” – “deva” here refers to the Supreme Being who is Krishna. It is the Lord’s protection of the Pandavas which is like a rod of chastisement for Ashvattama, as it prevents him from taking revenge. 

Ashvattama believes that Mahadeva can ward off even the Supreme Being’s punishment. How is this so? He explains below.

kapardinaṃ prapadyātha devadevam umāpatim

Meaning: I surrender to Kapardin, who has matted locks as he is an upāsaka meditating on Brahman, who is the God of Gods having performed the “Sarvamedha Yaga” (or) who is the chief of Sāttvikas signified by “deva” (devadevam), who is the consort of Umā who herself is a brahma-jnāni (or)  who is the possessor of “umā” meaning tranquility as he has no friend or foe, seeing Vāsudeva in all.

Ashvattama believes Rudra can even overcome the punishment administered by Krishna, the Supreme Lord, because Rudra is a bhakta and the Lord is known to favor his bhaktas. His matted locks signify that he is meditating on Brahman always. His devadevatvam is by virtue of his jnāna – or alternatively, “deva” means “sāttvika/jnāni” and he is the best of jnānis. 

Umā Haimavati is a great knower of Brahman herself, and he is her consort indicating she gets knowledge from him. Alternatively, he possesses “Umā” which means “tranquility” – lack of rāga, dvesha, etc and seeing all beings as pervaded by Vāsudeva.

The Lord, by his own will, is duty bound to grant the desires of those who follow the Vedas. Rudra has performed sufficient austerities in accordance with the Vedas and has worshipped Krishna to be elevated to his position. Thus, Krishna will have no choice but to grant Rudra the fulfillment of his boons. This is the thinking of Ashvattama. 

kapālamālinaṃ rudraṃ bhaga netraharaṃ haram

Meaning: One who is garlanded by skulls (or) whose ornament is the Self that is the keeper of bliss (kapālamālinaṃ), who cried on being born as he was a jnāni (rudraṃ), who destroyed the eyes of Bhaga signifying pain and pleasure of attachments (bhaga netraharaṃ), who is the destroyer of desire or lust (haram).

Not only is Shiva a bhakti-yogi, but he has knowledge of the self (jnāna-yoga) which makes him dear to Krishna.

“kapāla” refers to the individual self that is the keeper (pālaka) of bliss (kah iti sukham). Rudra’s ornament is the self, meaning he is involved in the experience of the self via meditation. He had this self-knowledge even during his birth, which is why he cried, realizing the undesirable nature of being born in samsara on account of his karmas. And thus, he tore the eyes of Bhaga, meaning the pain and pleasure of attachments (bhaga). In this way, he destroyed desire or lust for material objects and hence is “Hara”.

Such qualities mean that he is a great devotee and if he intercedes on behalf of Ashvattama, his wishes will be granted by Krishna.

sa hi devo 'tyagād devāṃs tapasā vikrameṇa ca

Meaning: That God indeed surpasses all other gods in austerities or knowledge of Brahman.

“tapasā” can signify his austerities, or it can mean knowledge of Brahman. Mundakopanishad says, “yasya jnānamayam tapah”. Rudra is superior to all devas in this aspect. Here, it can be taken to mean he is superior to all devas till Indra, as Brahma is superior to him. That Rudra is inferior to Brahma is mentioned by Rudra himself as follows during the preparation for war with the Tripuras:

tān abravīt punar devo mattaḥ śreṣṭhataro hi yaḥ

taṃ sārathiṃ kurudhvaṃ me svayaṃ saṃcintya māciram (~ Mahabharata, Karna Parva)

Meaning: Mahadeva then said again to the devas, “Deliberating amongst yourselves, make the one (Brahma) as my chariot driver who is superior to me in terms of being the Lord and creator of all the devas, in terms of learning, prowess etc”.

Alternatively, Rudra exceeding other gods can also mean he has exceeded even his father Brahma in knowledge, much like Suka exceeded his father Vyasa. It does not of course mean that Rudra is superior to Brahma, just as Suka is not superior to Vyasa in status.

tasmāc charaṇam abhyeṣye giriśaṃ śūlapāṇinam

Meaning: On account of that, I shall seek the protection of the Lord of Kailasa or the Ruler of the Veda (giriśaṃ), who is the holder of the Trident or Death to Samsāra (śūlapāṇinam)

“giri” refers to speech which is the Veda. He is their “iśa” as he has realized their conclusions. Thus, on account of such knowledge, he possesses the “śūla” which signifies upāsaṇa that is death to Samsāra. It is well-known that Rudra’s triśūla has 3 prongs – they pierce the triguṇās of prakrti.

And now, Ashvattama, having given sufficient reason to propitiate Rudra, embarks on a stuti to appease the god and gain his boon. 

The names in the stuti are not random. Each group of names are connected and describe attributes of Rudra in relevance to a particular topic. The topics are summarized in the subheadings.

Here begins the Stuti.

Rudra as the well-wisher for the Universe

ugraṃ sthāṇuṃ śivaṃ rudraṃ śarvam īśānam īśvaram 

Meaning: I bow to the one who is formidable to the asuras (ugraṃ), because he is the one fixated in Yoga which constitutes his activities to do good for the devas (sthāṇuṃ), because he is the auspicious one who can confer good (śivaṃ), because he is the Jnāni who cried upon his birth (rudraṃ), because he is the destroyer of his vices like kāma etc (śarvam), because he is the controller of his senses (īśānam), because he is the Lord of his mind on account of that (īśvaram).

For instance the connectivity in the names is as follows – he is formidable to asuras because he desires to do good for the devas. This is due to his agreeable nature (śivaṃ) which is on account of him being situated in knowledge right from birth. He was a Jnāni from birth, as he had destroyed lust, desire etc previously (in prior births even) by virtue of mastery over mind and senses.

Thus, there is a continuity about the names given here in this manner. Let us look at the rest of the stuti understanding this concept.

Rudra as the Possessor of Brahma-Vidya

giriśaṃ varadaṃ devaṃ bhavaṃ bhāvanam avyayam

 Meaning: He is the Lord of Kailasa, or the Ruler of the Vedas called “Speech” as he has realized their conclusions (giriśaṃ), the god who is the bestower of boons to his devotees due to his ascetic merit on knowing the Vedas (varadaṃ devaṃ), the One who exists in Brahman (bhavaṃ), thus the One who produces knowledge of Brahman (bhāvanam) and thus the One who is not covered by ignorance (avyayam – na vīyate).

“bhavaṃ” means to exist. Rudra exists…in what? He exists in Brahman, ie, he is always meditating on Brahman.

śitikaṇṭham ajaṃ śakraṃ krathaṃ kratuharaṃ haraṃ 

Meaning: Whose speech (kaṇṭha) is white or sattvic/pure (śiti) as he imparts  knowledge (śitikaṇṭham), because he moves towards Brahman in devotion (ajaṃ), and this is because he is mighty, ie, extremely intelligent (śakraṃ), as he  destroys ignorance (krathaṃ), who removed the (actions of the) mind associated with desire symbolized by destruction of daksha’s sacrifice (kratuharaṃ), thus the remover of desire as he burnt Kāma (haraṃ).

The destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice has an elaborate inner meaning enumerated in [this article](https://narayanastra.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_57.html). In short, the inner meaning is that Shiva is the bhakti yogi, Veerabhadra is the meditation on Brahman, Daksha is the mind and the sacrifice represents the actions of the senses. Meditation (Veerabhadra) corrects the mind (Daksha) and destroys the wayward actions of the senses (sacrifice). 

Rudra as the Jnāni par excellence

viśvarūpaṃ virūpākṣaṃ bahurūpam umāpatim

Meaning: Thus he is the one who is a pratīka or symbol for meditation on Vishnu (viśvarūpaṃ), thus one who has dissimilar eyes (or) has different or altered sight than others as he is indifferent to material enjoyments and perceives the self (virūpākṣaṃ), thus he has many forms, ie, he sees all beings as himself on account of seeing the similarity of the individual selves (bahurūpam) and who is the consort of Umā, or the possessor of Umā or tranquility, having no friends or foes (umāpatim).

“viśvarūpaṃ” – “viśva” refers to Vishnu. “rūpaṃ” means pratīka of Vishnu -  a pure form that can be meditated upon as Brahman by superimposing the attributes of Brahman. Since Shiva has purified himself by austerities, he becomes a pratīka in this manner.  

“virūpākṣaṃ” – This has a double meaning. Shiva has dissimilar eyes (3 eyes in total). But he also has a different sight than others in that he sees the Atma in all and does not dwell on differences in body such as man, deva etc. He also does not see material objects as pleasurable, but views them as painful.

“bahurūpam” – One who has many forms. In conjunction with the previous name, this speaks of Shiva as one who has attained the vision of the individual self, and sees himself in all and all in himself. Ie, he sees that all individual selves are identical in nature, thus he sees his own nature everywhere in all forms and considers the bodies as his.

“umāpatim” – “umā” means “tranquility”. On account of sama-darshana, he is not perturbed by enmity and other such characteristics. Alternatively, he who has all these noble qualities is the worthy consort of Umā, a great brahma-jnāni herself.

śmaśānavāsinaṃ dṛptaṃ mahāgaṇapatiṃ prabhum

Meaning: Who is a Jīva who resides in Samsārā, which is a graveyard as it is a place of death (śmaśānavāsinaṃ), who appears mad to other (ignorant) samsārīs by his peculiar manner of smearing ashes, laughing etc which are part of his upāsaṇa on Brahman (dṛptaṃ), Who is the possessor of the great multitudes of the innumerable auspicious attributes of Brahman (mahāgaṇapatiṃ), who is most powerful as he can bestow such knowledge to others (prabhum).

He resides in graveyards. Samsārā is itself a graveyard as it is a place of deaths. Hence this proves he is a Jīva. But despite such residence, he is not like others here in that he is always immersed in Brahman.

When it is said he is the possessor of Brahman’s auspicious attributes, it means he has knowledge of them all and is constantly experiencing the nectar of those attributes.

khaṭvāṅgadhāriṇaṃ muṇḍaṃ jaṭilaṃ brahmacāriṇam

Meaning: Who bears the “khaṭvāṅga” or the rod of authority to bewilder the asuras by giving them false knowledge such as pāshupata (khaṭvāṅgadhāriṇaṃ),  who is shaven-headed, ie, who himself is without ego despite being worshipped by such people as Supreme (muṇḍaṃ), who has the matted locks signifying his upāsaṇa on Sriman Narayana which is the reason why he doesn’t have ego or considers himself as Supreme (jaṭilaṃ), who always moves (carati) about in the Vedas (brahma), ie, always immersed in the true meaning of the Vedas, or following the dictates of the Vedas that reveal Narayana as Brahman (brahmacāriṇam).

This shloka summarizes Rudra’s role in propagating tāmasa shāstrās and yet clarifying that Rudra himself remains in perfect knowledge. A shaven head is indicative of ego being removed. So Shiva, despite being worshipped as Supreme by some groups of people, himself has no such illusions or ego.

Ashwattama’s Rationale for Worshipping Rudra

manasāpy asucintyena duṣkareṇālpa cetasā so 'ham ātmopahāreṇa yakṣye tripuraghātinam

Meaning: Purifying my mind which is so difficult to purify (as I possess great ego), being one who is of little intelligence, I offer myself (as the sacrifice) to the one who has purified his own mind by destroying the influence of the triguṇās signified by the three cities (tripuraghātinam). 

Ashwattama here declares the reason why he is invoking Rudra to remove Krishna’s protection of the Pandavas.

Bhagavan can only be conquered by bhakti and lack of ego. Rudra is a bhakta with no ego, who has destroyed the triguṇās (Tripura). Thus, he can make Bhagavan do anything he wants by his bhakti.

Ashwattama says that his mind is difficult to purify meaning, he has so much ego, that it is even difficult for him to bow to another person like Rudra. But he is doing that with great difficulty to achieve his objective. Ashwattama has no bhakti, but Rudra has bhakti towards Krishna which can gain him the desired object.

Reason for Rudra’s exalted position

The previous shlokas in the stuti served to highlight the true position of Rudra. In the succeeding shlokas, Ashwattama proceeds to praise the great attributes of Rudra as they are, for attainment of his desire.

stutaṃ stutyaṃ stūyamānam amoghaṃ carma vāsasam

Meaning: One who is praised (by Krishna) on account of always meditating on Brahman (stutaṃ), who, on account of that (status granted by Krishna), is to be praised by everyone for attaining  their desires (stutyaṃ), who is thus being praised by me, Ashvattama, for the attainment of my desire (stūyamānam), one who thus always gives fruits to those desirous people who worship him (amoghaṃ), who wears animal-skins (attire of a renunciate) signifying that he himself is detached from such desires despite fulfilling the desires of others (carma vāsasam)

Krishna worshipped Rudra on the pretext of obtaining a son to elevate Rudra to be competent in giving boons. Thus, Ashvattama declares that if he seeks a boon from Rudra against the Pandavas, Krishna would be duty-bound to oblige and not obstruct Rudra’s boon. Hence, Ashvattama worships Rudra for accomplishing his aims. 

How can Rudra fulfill boons and yet be detached from desire himself? Answered below.

Rudra as both Boon-Giver and Renunciate

vilohitaṃ nīlakaṇṭham apṛkthaṃ durnivāraṇam

Meaning: Who is reddish in complexion signifying him presiding over the mind which is full of desire (vilohitaṃ), who is blue-throated signifying him presiding over the mind full of anger (nīlakaṇṭham), who is nonetheless himself unmingled with material objects of prakrti, ie, indifferent (apṛkthaṃ), who cannot be disturbed by desire or anger on account of this (durnivāraṇam).

Regarding “Vilohita”, the name means “reddish”. It refers to Shiva being associated with the mind that is red or full of rajo-guna (desire), as the presiding deity. 

On account of that, he is “nīlakaṇṭham” – the blue/black-throated. “nīla” means black and “kaṇṭham” can signify any passage or means. The mind is the passage or instrument for the intellect. Thus, the inner meaning of the name is “black mind” – mind full of tamas born of rajas.  

The poison, hāla-hāla refers to the attachments to sense objects. This is because "viśam" also means "water" which can connote the subtle elements that constitute objects of enjoyment causing attachments.  This attachment is due to the mind being red (desire/rajo guna) and after such enjoyment, the mind becomes black on account of anger when such enjoyment is stopped (tamas).

Shiva is the presiding deity for the mind associated with such desire and anger. Hence, he can bestow boons for material objects. But the next two names “apṛkthaṃ” and “durnivāraṇam” clarify that he himself is not associated with those qualities and hence is detached.

Why is he detached? Answered below.

śukraṃ viśvasṛjaṃ brahma brahmacāriṇam eva ca 

Meaning: Who is pure on account of his austerities to cleanse his karmas (śukraṃ), who bestows purity in the form of bhagavad-jnāna to others (viśvasṛjaṃ), who is vast in knowledge, ie, his dharma-bhūta-jnāna (brahma) and who pervades (carati) by his dharma-bhūta-jnāna (brahmacāriṇam) alone.

A jnāni’s dharma-bhūta-jnāna expands greatly since his karmas are cleansed, so that his knowledge pervades and he knows everything by his knowledge, and can move about anywhere, experience everything simultaneously. Even Saubhari Muni could assume multiple bodies on account of this, so what to speak of a great personality like Rudra. Note that “eva” signifies that the movement and experience is only by his knowledge; unlike the Supreme Brahman who moves or pervades by both svarūpa and svabhāva (knowledge), Rudra’s svarūpa is still anu.

How did his dharma-bhūta-jnāna expand? Answered below.

Rudra as the Performer of Karma, Jnāna and Bhakti Yogas

vratavantaṃ taponityam anantaṃ tapatāṃ gatim

Meaning: Who is also a performer of duties pertaining to karma yoga (vratavantaṃ), who is ever engaged in knowledge (tapas) of the form of meditation on Brahman that is bhakti yoga (taponityam), who is opposed to the perishable body as he has knowledge of the self which is jnāna yoga  (anantaṃ), who is the refuge of the wise for knowledge of Brahman (tapatāṃ).

 “vratavantaṃ” – This signifies he is a karma-yogi, “taponityam” signifies he is a bhakti yogi. 

“anantaṃ” \- The body is called “anta” as it is associated with an end or destruction. Shiva is “ananta” as he is opposed to this body, as he has knowledge of the self as distinct from the body. Thus, this name “ananta” signifies he is a jnāna-yogi.

These three yogas are described in detail below. Karma and jnāna yogas can be clubbed since knowledge of the self as distinct from the body is a component of the karmas being performed. Hence, below, we have a description of Rudra’s status as a knower of the self which arises from karma-jnāna yogas.

bahurūpaṃ gaṇādhyakṣaṃ tryakṣaṃ pāriṣada priyam 

Meaning: Who assumes numerous forms by his dharma-bhūta-jnāna (bahurūpaṃ), who is the master of the multitudes of knowledge and renounciation (gaṇādhyakṣaṃ), who has 3 eyes or perceives the import of the three Vedas on account of this (tryakṣaṃ), who is fond of the self which is associated with the assembly that is the body (pāriṣada priyam).

The things to renounce are many and the knowledge to acquire is also many due to innumerable auspicious attributes. Thus, renunciation and knowledge are seen in multitudes.

“pariṣad” means assembly or the body which is an assembly of elements. “pāriṣada” refers to the self associated with this body. Rudra is fond of meditating on the self.

How does Rudra meditate on the self? Answered below.

gaṇādhyakṣekṣita mukhaṃ gaurī hṛdayavallabham

Meaning: Whose mind (mukha) sees that self which is the master of the body that is a cluster of elements (gaṇādhyakṣekṣita mukhaṃ), who is dear to Gauri’s heart (gaurī hṛdayavallabham).

The things to develop renunciation (vairagya) about are many. The things to develop knowledge (jnāna) about are also many. So, both are referred to as “gaṇās” – groups of knowledge and renunciation in “gaṇādhyakṣaṃ”

He is dear to Gaurī which indicates he is a great jnāni, as Gaurī herself is one. The name “Gaurī” also means possessor of “whiteness” or purity (gaura) which indicates sāttvic knowledge. Hence, “gaurī hṛdayavallabham” means he is dear to pArvati who herself possesses purity of knowledge. When someone is dear to a brahma-jnāni (pārvati), it is a reflection of his greatness.

kumāra pitaraṃ piṅgaṃ govṛṣottama vāhanam 

Meaning: Father of Kumara (or) cause of actions that destroys sins (kumāra pitaraṃ), the reddish brown in color (or) as he is associated with the mind that has rajas and tamas, by virtue of presiding over it (piṅgaṃ), who has the bull as his vehicle (or) who bears veda-dharma signified by the bull (govṛṣottama vāhanam).

These names have dual meanings – the superficial form and the inner meaning. The (or) indicates both have been provided.

This shloka describes Karma Yoga. “pitaraṃ” means cause and hence refers to him being the cause of karmas or action. It is the performance of desireless action while being associated with a mind of rajas and tamas (to curb it). The reference to the Bull implies that he adheres to the dharma of the Vedas which is part of karma yoga.

tanu vāsasam atyugram umā bhūṣaṇa tatparam

Meaning: Who abides in (meditates on) the self which is minute or subtle (tanu vāsasam), thus who is extremely formidable or fierce to triguṇās (atyugram), who is thus adorned by Umādevi or tranquility (Umā) from samsārā (umā bhūṣaṇa), who has the Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Brahman designated as “Tat”, as his Highest (tatparam).

One meditates on Nārāyaṇa as the means to gain freedom from the distress of the triguṇās and be situated in tranquility, and eventually to gain a vision of the self by meditation. This is jnāna yoga described here.

“tatparam” – Having that Supreme Brahman (tat) as his highest (param), meaning, he takes joy in being completely subservient to the Lord Nārāyaṇa, by virtue of recognition of the sharīrātma-bhāva. It also means, he meditates on Nārāyaṇa as the means to attain a vision of the self.

paraṃ parebhyaḥ paramaṃ paraṃ yasmān na vidyate

Meaning: Who is higher than the body which is distinct from the self, ie, indifferent to it (paraṃ parebhyaḥ), who is immersed in the blissful contemplation of the self (paramaṃ), on account of which there exists nothing different or other to him (paraṃ yasmān na vidyate) 

 “parebhyaḥ” in “paraṃ parebhyaḥ” refers to the body which is other(para) than the self. Rudra is higher (paraṃ) than the body, meaning he has risen above looking at differences in all. He is a knower of the self which is the same in all.

“paramaṃ” refers to the bliss of the self which is the highest object of enjoyment under the dominion of the Supreme Brahman. As Shiva is constantly immersed in the bliss of the self, he is closely associated with it and by aprthak siddhi, he is called “paramaṃ”.

On account of meditating on the self, he does not see himself as different from others, understanding everyone is identical in their essential natures, hence there is nothing different to him.

iṣvastrottamabhartāraṃ dig antaṃ caiva dakṣiṇam

Meaning: You are the bearer of weapons (or) you possess the strength and skills for upāsaṇa which is meditation on Brahman (iṣvastrottamabhartāraṃ), you are the very abode of directions, ie, you protect the worlds with your weapons (or) you are “death” (antam) to samsara signified by “dik” by virtue of your upāsaṇa (dig antaṃ) and you are well-disposed to the sāttvikās (or) you are submissive to paramātma, having recognized your seshatvam by virtue of your upāsaṇa (dakṣiṇam).

From here onwards, Shiva’s prowess in bhakti yoga is described.

“dig antaṃ” – Superficial meaning is that he is the abode of the Universe which is signified by “dik” in that he is a protector. Inner meaning is that he brings about an end (antam) to samsārā (dik) by his bhakti yoga.

“dakṣiṇam” means “paratantronuvartanam” – submissiveness or compliance which is the essential nature of the Jivātmā realized through yoga.

hiraṇyakavacaṃ devaṃ candra maulivibhūṣitam

Meaning: The god with a golden armor (or) the sāttvikā (devaṃ) who is protected by the armor of Brahmānubhava that is “gold” (hiraṇyakavacaṃ devaṃ), who is adorned by the moon on his head (or) who meditates on the auspicious attributes of bhagavān that are cool like the moon, as opposed to the heat of samsara (candra maulivibhūṣitam).    

“Gold”is a metaphor for anything enjoyable in the shāstra. The auspicious attributes of Brahman are enjoyable and also constitute a kavacha against the distress of samsārā.

Ashwattama’s Self-Surrender to Rudra

Having concluded his stuti, Ashwattama surrenders to Rudra for obtaining his boon.

prapadye śaraṇaṃ devaṃ parameṇa samādhinā

Meaning: With a mind concentrated (on my objective), I surrender to you, O Deva! 

imāṃ cāpy āpadaṃ ghorāṃ tarāmy adya sudustarām

sarvabhūtopahāreṇa yakṣye 'haṃ śucinā śucim

Meaning:  For crossing over this terrible calamity of being unable to get revenge on the Pandavas, which is difficult to cross over as the Pandavas are invincible with Krishna by their side, I sacrifice my body made of the five elements to you, who are the purest of the pure on account of you possessing the favor of Krishna, (and thus can fulfill my wish).

“sarvabhūtopahāreṇa”  \- My mind, body, senses all are meant for you. I am yours to command so long as you give me the boon I seek. This is the meaning.

imam ātmānam adyāhaṃ jātam āṅgirase kule  
agnau juhomi bhagavan pratigṛhṇīṣva māṃ balim

Meaning: O Bhagavān! I who am born of the lineage of Angirasa, will sacrifice my mind (ātmānam), as libation on this fire! 

 bhavadbhaktyā mahādeva parameṇa samādhinā  
 asyām āpadi viśvātman upākurmi tavāgrataḥ

Meaning: With devotion to you, Mahādeva, and with a mind concentrated (in achieving my objective), I offer myself to you as the sacrificial victim in this time of calamity, O one whose intellect pervades everywhere (viśvātman)!

“Atma” in “Viśvātman” refers to the intellect or dharma-bhūta-jnāna of Mahādeva that pervades everywhere. 

“mahādeva” – The great god who performed austerities like sarvamedha, etc. This signifies he is a karma yogi par excellence due to which his dharma-bhūta-jnāna has been expanded.

tvayi sarvāṇi bhūtāni sarvabhūteṣu cāsi vai

Meaning: All beings are in you and you are in all beings, ie, you who have realized the similarity of all individual selves with yourself as you are a jnāna-yogi par excellence! 

This clarifies that Rudra is also a great jnāna-yogi.

guṇānāṃ hi pradhcnānām ekatvaṃ tvayi tiṣṭhati

Meaning: The attributes of Brahman (guṇānāṃ) that are the principal objects of contemplation in various brahma-vidyās abide in you, ie, you are ever immersed in their contemplation and are a bhakti-yogi par excellence!

This further clarifies that Rudra is also a great bhakti-yogi.

sarvabhūtāśayavibho havir bhūtam upasthitam  
pratigṛhāṇa māṃ devayady aśakyāḥ pare mayā

Meaning: You are the asylum of all beings, O one who becomes full with Atma-guṇās by virtue of his upāsaṇa! I, being unable to vanquish my foes, wait as an offering for you. Accept me, O Deva!

This concludes the stuti. 

Following this, Rudra grants Ashvattama’s boon. We have also explained the meanings of the incidents that happen after this stuti in the Sauptika Parva in this article here – [https://narayanastra.blogspot.com/2017/11/analysis-of-sauptika-parva.html](https://narayanastra.blogspot.com/2017/11/analysis-of-sauptika-parva.html)

THE GREATNESS OF THE PĀNCHARĀTRA

It has been seen that some Veerashaivas, in their desperation to hide the truths and promote half-baked views, hide behind Shankara’s superficial denouncement of Pāncharātra in his Brahma-Sutra Bhāshya to avoid any acceptance of the Pāncharātra as a valid text. What they ignore (deliberately of course), is that Shankara never rejected the Pāncharātra in it’s entirety. He merely rejected one or two concepts that he felt were against the Veda (and this has been successfully rebutted by Acharya Ramanuja). But quoting his famous statement:

"tatra yattāvaducyatE yo 'sau nārāyaṇaḥ paro 'vyaktāt prasiddhaḥ paramātmā sarvātmā॥। yadyapi tasya bhagavato 'bhigamanādilakṣaṇam ārādhanam ajasram-ananya-cittayā'bhiprey- ate, tadāpi na pratisidhyate, śrutismtyorīśvarapraṇidhāna- sya prasiddhatvāt"

\[We do not intend to oppose the doctrine that nArAyaNa, who is superior the material universe, who is the supreme soul (paramAtmA), and the soul for all (sarvAtmA)... Nor do we mean to object to the inculcation of unceasing single-minded devotion on the Supreme Lord which appears in the Pancharatra doctrine under the forms of abhigamana (visiting Vishnu temples with utmost devotion in mind, with senses subdued) etc., for that we are to meditate on the Lord we know full well from shruti and smRti. - Brahma Sutra Bhashya, 2.2.42\] 

And advaitins who followed him went a step further in accepting the Pāncharātra in it’s entirety, even disagreeing with Shankara’s minor objections. As Amalananda writes:

jīvābhinnabrahmaṇo jagatsargaṃ vadataḥ samanvayasya jīvotpattipratipādakapāñcarātrasmṛtivirodhasaṃdehe, adhiṣṭhātaiveśvara iti mate niraste, prakṛtirapi sa iti matasya vedasaṃmatatvājjīvotpattāvapi pramāṇatvam — evaṃbhūtāvāntarasaṃgatilobhena smṛtpādasaṃgatamapyadhikaraṇamiha likhitam । tatra —

Meaning: The adhikaraNa is begun as follows — there is a doubt as to whether the the origination of the individual soul (jIvotpatti) must be accepted literally from statements in the pAncarAtra Agama. This tantra was composed by the Omniscient Lord, and are in agreement with the Veda in terms of the oneness of material and efficient causes. It cannot be said that these statements are made in error, since they were uttered by the Lord Himself, compared to other darshanas like sAMkhya, yoga, etc. that were composed by jIvas like Kapila, Patanjali, etc. Moreover, we do not see anywhere in the Puranas that the pAncarAtra tantra was propagated by the Lord Himself for the sake of delusion not unlike the doctrine of the Bauddhas propagated again by Himself to delude the wicked. Such a doubt is raised here.

The correct position, on the other hand , is as follows: “Since the Lord’s voluntary composition is the pAncarAtra tantra, and His involuntary breath is the shruti, statements of origination of the soul are secondary and figurative, not primary and literal”. The omnscience, benevolent nature, and infalliability of the Lord are all understood to be true only from the self-evident shruti. Hence, the pAncarAtra Agamas are dependent on the Veda for their authority. Hence, it cannot be said that they propagate the theory of origin of the individual soul literally, since it would contradict the shruti that says the individual soul is eternal. Therefore, such statements in the pAncarAtra are to be understood as secondary and conveying something else, and are not erroneous due to the reasons given in the prima facie position.

Note also that Amalānanda agrees with the pūrvapakṣa’s reasons to believe in the infalliability of Pāncharātras, which we have highlighted above. This guru notes that no purāṇa condemns Pāncharātra as un-vedic.

And we also have Sridhara who evinces an admiration for the adherents of the Pāncharātra Agama as follows in his Vishnu Purāṇa and bhagavata vyākhyāna:

Sridhara under VP 1.2.12:

“paramātmaiva ca sāttvatatantravidbhirvāsudeva ityucyate ityāha”: The Supreme Atman alone indeed is called Vasudeva by the knowers of the (pāñcarātra) tantras such as sāttvata.

Sridhara under VP 1.2.15:

“tathaiva nāradīyatantre ‘viṣṇostu trīṇi rūpāṇi puruṣākhyānyatho viduḥ । prathamaṃ mahataḥ sraṣṭṛ dvitīyantvaṇḍasaṃsthitam । tṛtīyaṃ sarvabhūtasthaṃ tāni jñātvā vimucyate”: Thus says the nāradīya tantra: ‘...therefore, the wise know the three forms of Vishnu called Purushas. The first is the creator of mahān, the second is the one situated in the cosmic egg. The third is the one inside all beings. Knowing these three, one is liberated’

Sridhara under Bhagavatam 11.10.1: 

“mayoditeṣv avahitaḥ sva-dharmeṣu mad-āśrayaḥ varṇāśrama-kulācāram akāmātmā samācaret ” mayā - pañcarātrādyuktavaiṣṇavadharmeṣu, avahito apramattaḥ।: Taking full shelter in me, with the mind carefully fixed in the devotional service of the Lord as spoken by me, one should live without personal desire and practice the social and occupational system called varṇāśrama.” Here, ‘devotional service spoken by me’ refers to the Vaishnava dharma explained in the pāncarātra texts. ‘Fixed in such devotional service’ means to be attentive/careful.

Sridhara under Bhagavatam 3.29.15: 

“kriyā-yogena śastena nātihiṁsreṇa nityaśaḥ ” kriyāyogena - pāñcarātrādyuktaprakāreṇa”: Without excessive violence, one should regularly perform one’s devotional activities.” Here, kriyā yoga means “by the method of worship enjoined in the pāncarātra etc.

Sridhara Swamin also says that the Vishvaksena the commander of Lord’s army in Shri Vaikuntha, is the personification of the pāncarātra tantra, just as Shri Garuda the Lord’s mount is the personification of the Vedas, in Srimad Bhagavatam 12.11.19-20.

A reading of the pāncharātra samhitās will show that it is a beautiful shāstra, full of crystal clear descriptions about the para-attva. Some portions are even more beautiful than the rāmāyaṇa, while others like Lakshmi Tantra contain unique concepts about the nature of Devi (Lakshmi) in relation to her Lord. 

When advaitins have clearly accepted these texts, why do two-bit Vishnu Dveshis like Veerashaiva continue to shy away from it and seek to speak of it derisively? The question contains an oxymoron actually. Because they know that their acceptance of the Agama will totally break their already flimsy stand on shiva-paratva.

Now, let us explore some quotations from the Mahābhārata on the pāncharātra. First, we will show some general statements on the Agama to highlight it’s authenticity:

idaṃ mahopaniṣadaṃ caturvedasamanvitam। sāṃkhyayogakṛtaṃ tena pañcarātrānuśabditam॥ nārāyaṃṇamukhodītaṃ nārado'śrāvayatpunaḥ। (~12-348-62 Mahābhārata, Sānti  Parva)

Meaning: This great doctrine, that takes one close to Brahman (Upanishad), explains the purport of the four Vedas harmoniously. It is based on the knowledge of the individual self or jnāna yoga called “sāṃkhya” and the performance of desireless action that is called “yoga” and called “pancarātra”. It has been expounded by Narayana, and Narada explained it once more.

As Acharya Ramanuja explains, “sāṃkhya” refers to concentrated meditation on the self which is of the nature of knowledge. This is jnāna yoga. The term “yoga” refers to “skilled action” which is karma yoga here. This shāstra advocating bhakti yoga and sharanāgati to the Lord is the culmination or fruit of jnāna and karma yogas.

 “brāhmaṇaiḥ kṣatriyairvaiśyaiḥ śūdraiśca kṛtalakṣaṇaiḥ ।sevyate'bhyarcyate caiva nityayuktaiḥ svakarmabhiḥ ॥ dvāparasya yugasyānte ādau kaliyugasya ca। sātvataṃ vidhimāsthāya gītaḥ saṃkarṣaṇena vai” ॥ (~6-66-39-40 Mahābhārata, Bhishma Parva)

Meaning: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, worship Him (Vāsudeva) in their daily rituals and activities. They are to worship Him in the dvāpara and in the beginning of kali yuga, using the sātvata rules expounded by Sankarshana (in the Pāncharātra texts).

tairekamatibhirbhūtvā yatproktaṃ śāstramuttamam॥ vedaiścaturbhiḥ samitaṃ kṛtaṃ merau mahāgirau।” (~12-343-28 Mahābhārata, Sānti  Parva)

Meaning: This lofty Pāncharātra shāstra that has been expounded unanimously (in agreement with all the Vedas and ancillary texts), has been declared equal to the four Vedas on the great mountain Meru.

evam ekaṃ sāṃkya yogaṃ vedāraṇyakam eva ca  
parasparāṅgāny etāni pañcarātraṃ ca kathyate  
eṣa ekāntināṃ dharmo nārāyaṇa parātmakaḥ (~Mahābhārata, Sānti Parva)

Meaning: Thus the Sānkhya-Yoga and the Veda which is like a forest (difficult to understand), being divisions of one another, are also called Pāncharātra. This is the means for those with one-pointed devotion to Nārāyaṇa, who comprises entities distinct to him (as their innerself).

The idea is that Sānkhya describes the 25 principles, Yoga describes methods of meditation, the Vedas show that everything other than Brahman is dependent on Brahman and has Brahman as their innerself, as well as the fact that meditation is directed towards Brahman. Thus, they are mentioned as divisions of one whole as they are one in terms of aiming towards one Reality.  And all these divisions are explained in the Pāncharātra by Nārāyaṇa himself.

A tight slap on the faces of Vishnu-Dveshis. Even Shankara did not ignore this and that is why he conceded partial validity for Pāncharātra.

- Bhagavat-Shāstra vs Other Systems in Mahābhārata  (Sānti  Parva)
    

The only possible challenge to this is, there is a section in the Sānti Parva of Mahābhārata that appears to give superficial validity to Sankhya, Yoga and Pāsupata systems as well. Let us examine that section. It will be shown that in that particular section, not only is the greatness of  Pāncharātra established, but Pasupati, the propagator of the Pāsupata shāstra, is declared to be a non-eternal jīva as well.

janamejaya

sāṃkhyaṃ yogaṃ pañcarātraṃ vedāraṇyakam eva ca jñānāny etāni brahmarṣe lokeṣu pracaranti ha kim etāny ekaniṣṭhāni pṛthaṅ niṣṭhāni vā mune prabrūhi vai mayā pṛṣṭaḥ pravṛttiṃ ca yathākramam

Meaning: Janamejaya: O Brahmarishi! Sankhya, Yoga, Pāncharātra  and Veda which is a forest (difficult to understand), are known to exist currently in the world. Do they have their ground or basis as one, or are they different? In response to my question, explain the manifestation (of these systems) in due order.

The crux of Janamejaya’s question is to understand this, as explained by Shri Ramanuja – Do all these systems of thought expound the same Reality, or different ones? If they are all the same, what is the nature of that Reality? If different, then only one of them can be accepted as authoritative, and that being the case, which one is authorititative?

After some description of the birth of Vyāsa, the answer is provided by Vaishampayana as follows:

sāṃkhyaṃ yogaṃ pañcarātraṃ vedāḥ pāśupataṃ tathā  
jñānāny etāni rājarṣe viddhi nānā matāni vai

Meaning: Sankhya, Yoga, Pancharatra, Veda and Pasupata – understand all these different systems (on the basis of their propagators).

The idea is, the validity of these systems is to be understood by the nature of their propagators which is mentioned below.

sāṃkhyasya vaktā kapilaḥ paramarṣiḥ sa ucyate  
hiraṇyagarbho yogasya vettā nānyaḥ purātanaḥ

Meaning: The propounder of Sankhya is that great rishi, Kapila. The propounder of Yoga is none other than Brahma. 

This shloka establishes that the founders of these two darshanas are baddha-jīvās, namely, Kapila and Brahma, and thus cannot be considered as perfectly error-free. 

To this, the pūrvapakśin may question, the rishi Kapila is highly celebrated in the Svetasvatara. The status of Brahma is also well-known. Can we then, reject these systems as non-vedic? The answer is provided in the first pada of the second adhyāya of brahma- sutras. The views of Kapila conflict with smritis authored by others like Manu who is considered an authority on all knowledge. Hence, there is no ground to consider Kapila’s views as valid despite his relative competency. Similarly, Brahma is susceptible to influences of rajas and tamas, and as in the case of the tāmasa-purāṇās which were narrated by him, is prone to error as well.

Thus, the ignorant view-point that “One should accept tāmasa-purāṇās as truth because of the nature of the author” is itself refuted by the Brahma Sutras and Mahābhārata.

Now, the authoritativeness of the Veda is revealed by the nature of it’s teacher:

apāntaratamāś caiva vedācāryaḥ sa ucyate 

prācīna garbhaṃ tam ṛṣiṃ pravadantīha ke cana

Meaning: The Rishi Apāntaratamās is the preceptor of the Vedas, who is called by some rishis as “prācīna garbhaṃ”  (abode of the Vedas which are called “prācīna”)

The Vedas do not have an author, as Apāntaratamās is indicated as the teacher of the Vedas and not as its’ author. Hence, they are flawless as opposed to the other systems mentioned so far on account of their unauthoredness.

Pāsupata system is now dismissed by Vaishampayana:

umāpatir bhūtapatiḥ śrīkantho brahmaṇaḥ sutaḥ

uktavān idam avyagro jñānaṃ pāśupataṃ śiva

Meaning: The Pāsupata system was propagated by Shiva who is the Lord of Uma, the ruler of embodied beings, the one who holds poison in his throat, who is the son of Brahma and whose knowledge of Reality is unperturbed (despite the teachings). 

As in the case of Brahma and Kapila, the Pāsupata system is dismissed on the grounds that it is authored by Shiva, a baddha-jīva. Here, the reason for calling Shiva by all these names is to be understood. 

Unlike the Sankhya and Yoga systems where Kapila and Brahma are the propagators but not the ones worshipped by the adherents, the Pāsupata system is propagated by Shiva who is himself worshipped as Supreme by the adherents of such a system. Thus, a doubt may arise as to whether Shiva himself is to be rejected as a competent authority on account of his acceptance of such improper worship, unlike Kapila and Brahma who are celebrated for their knowledge despite the propagation of erroneous systems.

To clarify that Shiva is not influenced by the opinions of the Pāsupata system, these adjectives are provided for him. The following provides the meaning for these names:

- “Umāpati” – Lord of Umā who is a Brahma-Jnāni herself. This means Shiva is also a jnāni and not an outcaste despite being worshipped in the pāsupata system.
    

  

- “bhūtapatiḥ” –  As he declares in the Harivamsha, “Isoham sarvadehinām”  – he is the Ruler of embodied beings associated with rajo and tamo guṇās and thus propagates shāstrās contrary to the Veda but which have relative value in providing direction to people of those inclinations.
    

  

- “Śrīkantha” – There are many meanings for this. The first is “poison-throated” – Just as Shiva holds the poison in his throat without being affected by it, he propagates the “poison” which is veda-bāhya Pāsupata without himself being affected by their adherents worshipping him as Supreme. The second is “poison-speech” (“kantha”  also refers to speech) – and this again means his teachings (speech) of the Pāsupata system are like spewing poison. Also, the hala-hala visha indicates attachments and Shiva signifies the mind – thus the Pāsupata system is for those whose minds are possessed by rajas and tamas. This name indicates clearly the avaidika nature of the Pāsupata system.
    

  

- “brahmaṇaḥ sutaḥ” – The son of Brahma, who abides by the directions of Brahma (brahmānam kamalāsanastham) – since Brahma in turn abides by the directions of Narayana, the implication is Shiva abides by the dictates of the Lord. Thus, he spread the Pāsupata system glorifying his own worship with improper tattvas on Nārāyaṇa’s orders and not because he himself is veda-virodha.
    

  

- “avyagro jñānaṃ” – Despite the adherents of the Saiva religion worshipping him as supreme, he himself is crystal clear in his knowledge of his own position and Nārāyaṇa as the Supreme Reality. 
    

  

- “Śiva” – He is cleansed of karmas due to his austerities and bhakti for Narayana, and hence, is unaffected by the doshas associated with the Pāsupata system.
    

The need for all these adjectives is simply because Shiva is worshipped as supreme in the system he propagated, whereas Brahma and Kapila  do not have that status in their respective systems. Hence, these names are clarificatory in nature.

The above interpretation is also validated by the Brahma Sutras’ rejection of Pāsupata as well as Shiva’s own words in Rudra Gita of Varaha Purana:

ye rudramupajīvanti kalau vaiḍālikā narāḥ ।laulyārthinaḥ svaśāstrāṇi kariṣyanti kalau narāḥ ।ucchuṣmarudrāste jñeyā nāhaṃ teṣu vyavasthitaḥ ॥ (~ Varaha Purana, Rudra Gita 71.55)॥

Meaning: (Rudra said): Those people who sustain themselves on desire which causes weeping or attachment (Rudram) in kali are enemies of the path of the Veda. These people create their own shāstras (derived from the nihshvāsa) for the purpose of rajas or passion in Kali. They of manifest passion (rajas), abide in Rudra (myself), but it should be known that I am not situated with them (in that path).

This includes even those Saivas like the Nayanmars whose bhakti to Shiva was for the purpose of moksha as opposed to artha, kama etc, because any attachment other than to the Supreme Reality (Nārāyaṇa), is of the nature of Samsāra and falls under the umbrella of desire --- here, it is desire to attain a particular deva (Rudra) who isn’t liberated himself or the Supreme.

Thus, the Pāsupata system is rejected. It is to be noted that these proofs establish that the rejection of this system in the Brahma Sutras is not only for it’s denial of material causality, but also for the elevation of a jīva (Shiva) as supreme and denigration of the Supreme (Nārāyaṇa) to a lesser reality.

Now, we come to the Pāncharātra.

Paṅcarātrasya kṛtsnasya vaktā nārāyaṇaḥ svayam । jñāneṣveteṣu rājendra sarveṣvetadviśiṣyate

Meaning: The propagator of the Pāncharātra in its’ entirety is Nārāyaṇa  himself. Out of all these (systems), the (best) knowledge is to be obtained from these.

The subject of the Veda, which was previously established as the supreme authority on account of its’ unauthoredness, is Nārāyaṇa. This is indicated by “svayam” – as opposed to the likes of Kapila, Brahma, Pasupati, etc who are jIvās endowed with Aveshās of the Lord, the Lord Nārāyaṇa is verily the Supreme Brahman himself. Other recensions have “svayam bhagavān” instead of “Narayana” which conveys the same meaning (that Kapila, Brahma, Pasupati are not Bhagavān), as it denotes Vishnu only. Thus, it follows that the bhagavat-shāstra authored by Narayana himself, is flawless and offers the best knowledge.

Here, a question may be asked – if the succeeding verse says that out of all the previously mentioned systems, the Pāncharātra offers the best knowledge, does it undermine the Vedas which were previously hailed as flawless and also included here among other systems? 

The answer is, the Pāncharātra is better than the systems of Kapila, Brahma and Pasupati as it faithfully adheres to the Vedas. It is also considered better than the Vedas, because it explains the meaning of the Vedas with clarity – whereas the Vedas are confusing like a forest (Aranyakam), accessible only to select castes and highly knowledgeable people. The infinite compassion of the Lord in disseminating an easily understandable shāstra is implied by this. 

This also refutes Shankara’s objections in his brahma-sūtra-bhāśya that the Pāncharātra undermines the superiority of the Vedas by claiming to be better than the latter. Even the Mahabhārata has such a laudatory statement about the Agama being superior to the Veda due to its’ clarity. 

yathāgamaṃ yathā jñānaṃ niṣṭhā nārāyaṇaḥ prabhuḥ na cainam evaṃ jānanti tamo bhūtā viśāṃ pate

Meaning: (In all the above-mentioned systems) in accordance to the tradition and aids to knowledge like logic, the ground or basis (for these systems) is the Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa. Those who are deluded by the darkness of ignorance brought on by beginningless karmas do not understand him.

The meaning of this shloka, as given by Acharya Ramanuja is this – the Veda says Nārāyaṇa is sarvabhūtāntarātma. Thus, the tattvas described in the Sankhya, Yoga and Pāsupata systems have Nārāyaṇa as their self. 

The idea is that, the Sankhya system is rejected, but it’s teaching of the 25 tattvas is accepted and the rejection is simply because they do not accept that these tattvas have Nārāyaṇa as their innerself.  The Yoga system is rejected, but the methods of meditation are accepted and the rejection is only because that system does not accept Yoga as a method of meditation on Nārāyaṇa. The Pāsupata system is rejected for it’s lack of acceptance of material causality, for the elevation of a jīva (Pasupati) as Brahman and certain erroneous practices like wearing ashes etc, but the descriptions of Pasu and Pasha as well as the existence of Pasupati is also accepted and these also have Nārāyaṇa as their self. 

Thus, Nārāyaṇa alone is the basis of all these systems. And since this Nārāyaṇa, who is revealed by the Veda, is himself the propagator of the Pāncharātra, the system describes his nature and the methods to attain him, and acknowledges he is the self of all including the tattvas delineated by the other systems. For this reason, this Pāncharātra is held as valid and containing all other systems within itself.

tam eva śāstrakartāraṃ pravadanti manīṣiṇaḥ  
niṣṭhāṃ nārāyaṇam ṛṣiṃ nānyo 'stīti ca vādinaḥ

Meaning:  That indeed is proclaimed by those qualified to meditate on Brahman, who are authors of smritis (like Manu, Vyāsa), that Nārāyaṇa, who is Omniscient (ṛṣiṃ) alone is the basis or ground (of all these systems) and none other.

Vaishampayana is saying, “The idea of Nārāyaṇa being the ground of all these systems is not something I am saying out of my own imagination; it is the considered opinion of authorities like Manu, Vyāsa, etc. Also, the Lord being omniscient implies that the knowledge he himself disseminates is flawless.

Note that by this, Nārāyaṇa being the ground or innerself of Pasupati (Shiva) is well-established, considering the Pāsupata system advocates Pasupati as the object of worship.

 niḥsaṃśayeṣu sarveṣu nityaṃ vasati vai hariḥ  
 sasaṃśayān hetubalān nādhyāvasati mādhavaḥ

Meaning: Hari, who destroys karmas (harati pāpāni), resides ever in (the hearts of) those who have dispelled all doubts. Madhava, the Master of Knowledge about himself (mā = knowledge of Hari, dhava = swami), never resides in those who are plagued by doubt due to the force of false argumentation.

The condemnation of the likes of Veerashaiva who indulge in jalpa is in the shāstra itself, or so it would seem! 

paṅcarātravidō yē tu yathākramaparā nṛpa । 

ēkāntabhāvōpagatāstē hariṃ praviśanti vai ॥ (Mahabharata, 12.337.67)

Meaning: O King! He who understands the Pāṅcarātra, who adheres to its’ injunctions attaining single-minded devotion, reaches Hari.

The validation of the Pāṅcarātra is thus complete.

sāṃkhyaṃ ca yogaṃ ca sanātane dve; vedāś ca sarve nikhilena rājan

sarvaiḥ samastair ṛṣibhir nirukto; nārāyaṇo viśvam idaṃ purāṇam

Meaning: The two, Sānkhya and Yoga, are eternal as are the Vedas in their entirety, O King! All the rishis in unison proclaim that Nārāyaṇa  is this ancient Universe.

By “Sānkhya” and “Yoga”, it is meant that the entities described in these systems – namely the pradhāna and the individual self – are eternal. Similarly, the Vedas are also eternal. And these eternal entities have Nārāyaṇa as their self, which is declared  by saying “nārāyaṇo viśvam idaṃ” – By virtue of sāmānādhikaraṇya, it means that Nārāyaṇa is the innerself of the Universe.

Note that the Pāsupata system is not mentioned to be eternal here. The reason is this – Sānkhya describes the 25 tattvas and Yoga describes modes of meditation and the individual self which are all real and eternal. However, the Pāsupata system describes Pasupati who is not an eternal entity. He is a jīva occupying a specific perishable body which is subject to death and hence he cannot be considered eternal even if he has Nārāyaṇa as his self. Of course, tattvas of prakrti and the individual self are eternal in the sense that they never cease to exist, but the particular person of “Pasupati” is just a jīva in a specific birth and hence is non-eternal as he disappears during pralaya. 

In this manner, this section establishes the jīvatva and abrahmatva of Shiva, glorifying the Pāṅcarātra Sāstra.
