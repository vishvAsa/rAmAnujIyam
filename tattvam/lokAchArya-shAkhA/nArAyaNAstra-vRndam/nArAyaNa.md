#### On the name "Narayana" used to denote Supreme Brahman in the Vedas

This is an article regarding the word _"**nArAyaNa**"_. It is well known that _vaiShNavas_ prove _viShNu paratva_ (Supremacy of Lord Vishnu) using the name _nArAyaNa_. One can look into the [introduction of the SrI Rudram vyAkhyAna](http://narayanastra.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_7196.html) on this blog to understand how _viShNu paratva_ is arrived at.

The shaivas pose the following argument:

- _nArAyaNa_, even if it means a proper noun according to panini can still denote Shiva as he can be equated to this deity.
    
- _nArAyaNa_ is not a proper noun since there is no rule that the veda needs to follow panini grammar.
    

Argument 2) arises because shaivas are defeated by 1) and hence resort to this. But we will explain both. I am not going to go into details as to how _viShNu paratva_ is proven because that has already been summarised in the _shrI rudram_ intro section of the blog. But this article will simply clarify some truths with respect to the name “**_nArAyaNa_**”.

EXPLANATION OF THE NAME “NARAYANA”

**_nArAyaNa_** as a proper noun since all _vaidikas_ have accepted this. And it is very easy to show that _nArAyaNa_ does not denote Shiva.

Panini grammar states this name is a proper noun because of the **_Na_**-kAra. This has been discussed already and needs no more explanation.

Since _nArAyaNa_ is a proper noun, the following explanation is arrived at. A word can have a _yaugika_  or _rUDhi_ artha. _Yaugika artha_ is a meaning obtained by joining words while _rUDhi_ points to the commonly known meaning for the word. But when the word is accepted to be a proper noun as per panini grammar due to the _**Na**_-kaara, the yaugika  meanings of the word _nArAyaNa_ also point to the one who is denoted commonly by this name (rudi). Names like Shiva, Indra, Brahma, etc which are common nouns and hence can denote anyone besides the popular deities.

As an example, _"shUrpanakha"_ can mean anyone with large nails like a winnow if _yaugika_ is used. But when it becomes _shUrpa**Na**kha_, a proper noun as per paninian grammar, it denotes the sister of _rAvaNa_ who has large winnow-like nails. In other words, if it is a proper noun, all meanings of the word denote the commonly known person referred by the name – in this case, the sister of _rAvaNa_.

So, similarly the proper noun makes the meanings of the word _nArAyaNa_ denote only the person who is commonly referred to by the name. And the only one who is commonly referred to by the _yaugika_ and _rUDhi_ usage of the name is _shrI mahA-vishNu_.

In other words, the name “**_nArAyaNa_**” has several meanings – “One in whom all things inhere”, “One who is the resorted to by all”, “One whose abode is in the waters”, etc. Because of the “**_Na_**_kAra_”, ALL these meanings denote the person commonly known by this name, which is of course, _shrI vishNu_.

Some ignorant of Sanskrit grammar and _vaiShNava_ traditions mistakenly think we use only the meaning “He who lies in the waters” to identify _vishNu_ with _nArAyaNa_. This is nothing but stupidity. Due to paninian grammar, even the _yaugika_ artha of “He in whom all things inhere” denote only _mahA vishNu_ and not any other deity.

But then, shaivas try another argument: It is not necessary to take Paninian grammar since the veda itself does not need to follow such rules.

To that we say: The very context where the _nArAyaNa nAma_ occurs itself establishes it as a proper noun. What other _sUkta_ has the words “_param brahma, para tattva, paro jyotiH_, etc” so explicitly stated? All _sUktas_ glorify _vishNu_ only. But the choicest and most clarifying epithets are used with this _nAma_. The reason is because while other _sUktas_ are also _bhagavad stuti_s, the vedas expect us to begin with the most appropriate name for Parabrahman – _nArAyaNa_. So, all proofs must proceed from this name. Secondly, _shrI rAmAnuja_ establishes in his _vedArtha saMgraha_ the reason why the _nArAyaNa sUkta_ holds precedence over others like _indra sUkta_, _agni sUkta_, etc.: Those other _sUktas_ have come about because of a specific reason – take the example of the _rudram_. The _prashnam_ came about because of a desire to quell the wayward _indrIyas_ and recommends propitiating _narasiMha_. So, the underlying motive is _indrIya nigraha_. Therefore, it directly embarks on praising the _bhagavad guNas_ (like beauty of his arms, etc) without dwelling much on giving a definition of Brahman.

But the _nArAyaNa sUkta_ has no such underlying motive. It is solely devoted to ascertaining the true nature of Brahman and hence takes precedence over other _sUktas_. Please keep in mind that this does not belittle other _sUktas_ – they all glorify _bhagavAn_ only.

Common sense itself shows this paninian grammar holds.

However, let us humor our opponents. Without even using Paninian grammar, it is easy to prove that nArAyaNa is not _shiva_ or anybody other than _vishNu_. Firstly, _nArAyaNa_ occurs in the same context as the terms “_sath,_ _Atma, brahman_”, etc. And the reference to “_para tattvam_”, etc in the _nArAyaNa sUkta_ shows that _nArAyaNa_ is unambiguously the highest term for the supreme reality.

Secondly, because Shiva has been declared as different from _nArAyaNa_ by various _shruti vAkya_s, he is not _nArAyaNa_. These shruti _vAkya_s include such as the following:

- _**"eko ha vai nArAyaNa AsIt, na brahmA, neshAnaH"**_
    
- _**"nArAyaNAt brahmA jAyate, nArAyaNat rudro jAyate"**_
    

And so on.

Thirdly, the _vishNu gAyatri_ equates this _nArAyaNa_ directly with _vishNu:_

"_**Om nArAyaNAya vidmahe, vAsudevAya dhImahi, tanno viShNuH pracodayAt**_".

Whereas, the _rudra gAyatri_ uses the format,

_**tatpurushhaaya**_ _vidmahe mahaadevaaya dhiimahi | tanno rudraH  prachodayaat.h ||_

As interpreted elsewhere on this blog, the usage of “**_tatpuruSha_**” is to show the following meanings: “Rudra, who belongs (as _vibhUti_) to Brahman designated as _tat_ (_tasya paramAtmanaH puruShAya_). Or, one can take _nArAyaNa_ as “**_tatpuruSha_**” \- ‘_sa cAsau puruShashcha_’ – and say “we meditate on Rudra to attain that _puruSha_ known as _nArAyaNa_” which means that the usage of “_tatpuruSha_” is to show that Rudra is different and distinct from this _puruSha_ and only leads the seeker to him.

But in the case of the _vishNu gAyatrI_, the usage of the “_nArAyaNa_” _nAma_ directly shows the identity (as opposed to merely acting as a mediator in the case of rudra) of _nArAyaNa_ with _vishNu_.

Other pramAnAs like “hrIshca te lakShmIshca patnyau” as referring to the consorts of vishNu have already been explained.

Fourthly, names such as “_shiva_”, “_shambhu_” etc are addressed to _nArAyaNa_ in the _nArAyaNa sUkta_ itself as well as _viShNu sahasranAma_ showing all these names denote _viShNu_ only.

Thus, _**nArAyaNa**_ is a proper noun  because:

- Panini says so.
    
- All ancient _vedAntins_ have accepted this. _**shrI yAmunAchArya**_ explicitly states in _**stotra ratna**_ – “what _vaidika_ would deny **_nArAyaNa_** is the parabrahman_?_” showing that no _vaidika_ – advaitin, vishishtadvaitin or dvaitin – ever contested this during his time.
    
- The context of the name in the veda itself indicates this.
    

This _**nArAyaNa**_ is _viShNu_ and all meanings of the name denote only _lakshmIpathi viShNu_ and no other deity because:

- Other deities have been declared as distinct from _nArAyaNa_.
    
- Only _viShNu_ is identified with _nArAyaNa_ along with distinctive characteristics. This is proven both by using the “_**Na**_-_kAra_” rule (_“pUrvapadAt saMj~nAyAm agaH”, aShTAdhyAyi_ 8.4.3) and even without using it.
    
- It also rules out bizarre claims that _nArAyaNa_ is _nirguNa_ brahman, etc. Adi Shankara himself has only used the “_nArAyaNa_” with the “_**Na**-kAra_” showing that it denotes a specific entity, ie, saguNa brahman. Besides the fact that _nirguNa brahman_ is devoid of names, the “_**Na**-kAra_” makes it impossible to attribute this to any entity besides _lakShmIpati viShNu_. And as seen earlier, even without “_**Na**-kAra_”, it denotes _saguNa_ brahman, ie, _viShNu._ Even according to shaivas like Appayya Dikshita, who had to accept this fact after much debate.
