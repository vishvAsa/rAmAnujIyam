#### Tamasatva of certain Puranas: Texts with little Vedantic authority

_Note: This page is a contribution of the Srivaishnava sampradAya follower who represented the side of Vaishnavism with me against the author of the mahapashupatastra blog page. My own comments are added in italics like this, preceded by three % signs._   
  
This is a short article regarding the status of the tAmasa purAnAs in vedAntA.  
  
As is well known, the 18 purAnAs are classified into three groups – sattva, rajas and tamas. This classification comes from the purAnAs itself and is accepted by all advaitins, vishishtadvaitins and dvaitins. Yet, some people, frustrated at the fact that all the purAnAs classified as sattva praise Vishnu-nArAyaNa only, have attempted to dismiss this classification using much abused arguments like ‘interpolations’ and ‘vaishnava conspiracy’.   
  
One must note that the classification is accepted by vaidika acharyas not only based on the slokas that suggest such a classification, but also only on the strength of pramAnAs. Here are some justifications that pretty much seal the classification:  
  
  
**1) The** **tAmasa purAnAs contradict Shruti**  

  
A simple rule of vedAntA is that whatever contradicts shruti is rejected and whatever conforms to shruti is accepted. The knowledgeable rishis have stated that the first authority is apAurushEya shruti, followed by the pAurushEya granthas like IthihAsA and purAnA. Among these two, ithihAsA enjoys a greater authority since it is a documented history at the very time of its occurrence, as opposed to purAnAs which speak of histories that happened long time ago.  
  
The shruti identifies the parabrahman as nArAyaNa only by using the chAga paShu nyAyA and the logic of the word ‘nArAyaNa’ being a proper noun. The mahOpanishad statement‘Eko ha vai nArAyaNa asIt, na brahma, nEshana’ differentiates nArAyaNa from Brahma and Rudra (Eeshana), who are mentioned to be absent during pralaya. The nArAyaNopanishad declares that Brahma and Rudra are born of nArAyaNa vide ‘nArAyaNa brahma jAyatE, nArAyaNa rudrO jAyatE’. The satapatha brahmaNa declares that Rudra is born of karma as he refers to himself as ‘anapahatapApmA’. Again, the nArAyaNa suktam declares Brahma and Rudra as vibhUtIs of nArAyaNa vide ‘sa brahma sa siva sEndra’.  
  
The same nArAyaNa suktam also calls nArAyaNa as ‘Shambhu’ (vishwashambhuvam), ‘Siva’ (sivamachyutam), etc. This shows that terms like Shambhu, Siva, Rudra, etc are common nouns that denote nArAyaNa only. Hence, statements like ‘PurushO vai RudrO’ or ‘Siva eva kevalam’ denote nArAyaNa. The husband of pArvati is not denoted by these statements as his birth owing to karma is conclusively establuished by the vedA.  
  
For a detailed proof, refer the section on Shri Rudram in this website.  
  
The tAmasa purAnAs contradict the shruti completely. The story of Brahma and Vishnu unable to find the beginning or end of a flaming Linga as seen in the shiva purAnA and others is not only illogical, but finds no mention in shruti. On the other hand, the sAttvika purAnAs uphold that Brahma was born of nArAyaNa and Rudra was born to Brahma (and hence, born of nArAyaNa, the antaryAmin of Brahma) as well.   
  
To this, shaivas like Appayya Dikshitar have a unique argument which has now come to be known as the sadA shiva brahma vAdA. They state that the shruti vAkyAs ascribing a birth to Rudra are actually denoting the Rudra who is the samhAra karta, ie, the destroyer. There is a being known as ‘sadA shivA’ or ‘Rudra’ or ‘ParamEshwara’ who is above this Rudra, and also above Brahma and Vishnu. Hence, Brahma, Vishnu and the ‘samhAra rudra’ are born of this sadA shivA.  
  
The above theory has zero basis in shAstrA. There is nothing indicating the existence of two different rudrAs in shruti and smriti. In shruti, nArAyaNa is identified as parabrahman and since this is a proper noun, it is impossible to postulate a ‘sadA shivA/ParamEshwara’ (which is a common noun) and ascribe the name of nArAyaNa to this being. Secondly, the smritis identify only one rudra, who is the husband of pArvati, who is blue necked and the dweller of kailAsA, and who was born of Brahma and who bears the Ganga flowing from the lotus feet of sriman nArAyaNa. There is no pramAnA for existence of two blue necked, pArvati patIs or two kailAsAs, one being born and the other being unborn.  
  
Also, this division of ‘sadA shiva’ and ‘samhAra rudra’ involves 1) assuming the existence of two such rudrAs in the first place without any basis, 2) randomly ascribing vAkyas describing a birth to ‘samhAra rudra’ and statements glorifying parabrahman by the name of ‘rudra’ to ‘turIya shiva’, 3) Being unable to equate ‘sadA shivA’ to nArAyaNa, an assumption is made that nArAyaNa is lower to ‘sadA shivA’, which is quite baseless and contradicts shruti, 4) Failure to acknowledge shAstra attributing names like ‘rudra’, ‘shiva’, etc to nArAyaNa only. Thus, this theory is discarded.  
  
Hence, it is established that the tAmasa purAnAs contradict shruti. **Since wrong knowledge is a form of tAmas, these purAnAs are classified as ‘tAmasa purAnAs’.**    
  
  
**2) The tAmasa purAnAs contradict smriti**  
  
We restrict ourselves to Gita, rAmAyaNa and mahAbhAratA by the name of ‘smriti’.  
  
The gita clearly has vAsudeva krishNa declaring himself to be parabrahman. And we can also see that terms like ‘MahEshwara’ and ‘ParamEshwara’ are addressed to KrishNa only in the Gita. The tAmasa purAnAs which refer to Vishnu as a servant of Rudra, which belittle Vishnu’s sarvaj~natvam, sarvasaktitvam, etc contradict the Gita in many ways.  
  
Next comes rAmAyaNa. The shiva purAnA has various stories of rAmA worshipping shiva to cure himself of a brahmahatya dosham he incurred by killing rAvana. **The vAlmiki rAmAyaNa does not contain a single instance of rAmA worshipping shiva.** Rather, the following two pramAnAs are found:  
  
HanumAn tells rAvana thus:  
  
**brahmaa vaa svayambhuuH chaturaananaH rudraa vaa triNetraH tripuraantakaHmahendraH vaa indraH suranaayakah na shaktaaH traatum raamavadhyamyudhi (~sundara khAnda – 51.45)**  
  
_Neither Brahma the self-existing god with four faces or Rudra with three eyes and the destroyer of Tripura or Mahendra the god of atmosphere and sky as also the lord of celestials would not be able to protect the one to be killed by Rama in battle."_  
  
When neither Brahma, Rudra nor Indra can defeat rAmA, why should rAmA worship any of them?  
  
When the dharma sAstras say that the killing of a brahmaNa is not a sin in battle, why would rAmA incur brahma hatya dosha by killing rAvana? We see that KrishNa himself ordered the killing of DronAchAryA. But neither the pAndavas, who lied that Ashwattama was dead, nor Drshtadyumna, who killed DronAchAryA, nor KrishNa paramAtmA, who ordered the killing, incurred brahma hatya dosha even though DronAchAryA was a brahmaNa. So, why would such a dosha occur in the case of rAvana?  
  
Thus, the shiva purAnA and other tAmasa purAnAs claiming rAmA to have incurred brahma hatya dosha and worshipping Shiva contradicts vAlmiki rAmAyaNa.  
  
The story of rAmA worshipping shiva is also found in some works like tulasidas rAmacharitmanas. However, vAlmiki rAmAyaNa is utmost pramAnA. No other rAmAyaNa is considered authentic if it deviates from vAlmiki maharishi’s observations. These other rAmAyaNas merely followed the tAmasa purAnAs in their storytelling.  
  
The mahAbhArata also supports that Brahma and Rudra were born of nArAyaNa, vide shanti parva (12.328.5 onwards; refer section on shri rudram). pArvati pati is nowhere declared to be parabrahman. Epithets like Mahadeva, Devadeva etc are applied to pArvati pati on account of his greatness among the devas only.  
  
An example of the deviation that the tAmasa purAnAs show from mahAbhArata can be seen in the instance of Tripura samhArA. We have already seen the inner meaning of Tripura samhArA in the section on shri rudram in this website.   
  
The shiva purAnA while describing the destruction of tripurA, states that Vishnu became the arrow, misled the asurAs and positioned the earth in the form of an ox because of his subservience to Rudra. However, this theory is completely contradicted by the mahAbhAratA, which states the following while describing the destruction of Tripura:  
  
**The universe is similarly said to consist of Vishnu. Vishnu is, again, the Soul of the holy Bhava (Rudra) of immeasurable energy. For this the touch of that bow-string became unbearable to the Asuras.**  
** ….**  
**In consequence, however, of the pressure caused by the weight of Soma, Agni, and Vishnu that were in that shaft, as also of the pressure caused by the weight of Brahman and Rudra and the latter's bow, that car seemed to sink. Then Narayana, issuing out of the point of that shaft, assumed the form of a bull and raised that large car.**  
**(MahAbHArata, Karna Parva, Chapter 34)**

  
The relevant verses are given below:  
  
**_viṣṇuś cātmā bhagavato bhavasyāmita tejasaḥ _**

**_tasmād dhanurjyā saṃsparśaṃ na viṣehur harasya te_**   
  
from the Shanti Parva of Mahabharata, and  

  
**_tato madhye divyashabdaH prAdurAsInmahIpate |  
R^iShINAM brahmaputrANAM mahatAmapi bhArata ||3-133-62  
sa eSha sha~NkarasyAgre ratho bhUmiM pratiShThitaH |  
ajeyo jayyatAM prAptaH sarvalokasya pashyataH ||3-133-63_**  
  
**_atha viShNurmahAyogI sarvatodR^ishya tattvataH |  
vR^iSharUpaM samAsthAya projjahAra rathottamam||3-133-70_** 

  
in the [Tripuravadha Vrittanta chapter](http://mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/bhavishyaparva/hv_3_133_mpr.html) of the Bhavishya parva of Harivamsa (appendix to the Mahabharata).  
  
Thus, the mahAbHArata clearly states that Vishnu was the Self, ie, the antaryAmin of Rudra and that was the reason why his bow had incomparable tejas. The various assistances such as nArAyaNa assuming the form of a bull etc are related to the parabrahman aiding the chEtana by his anugraham during bhakti yOgA, as explained in the section on Shri Rudram.  
  
The shiva purAnA which states that Vishnu was subservient to Rudra during Tripura samhArA, clearly is against the mahAbHArata which states that Rudra accomplished the destruction of Tripura because Vishnu was his inner self, ie, antaryAmin.   
  
Thus, the tAmasa purAnAs contradict mahAbhArata as well.  
  
The Gita, rAmAyaNa and mahAbHArata were composed by krishNa, vAlmiki and vyAsa respectively. The tAmasa purAnAs thus contradict the words of krishNa, vAlmiki and vyAsa.  
  
**Since knowledge that contradicts whatever is taught by great authorities in authentic works is a form of tAmas, these purAnAs are classified as ‘tAmasa purAnAs’.**

  
  
**3) The tAmasa purAnAs do not recommend proper brahma-jignyAsa**  
  
The Sattvik Puranas always begin with a neutral question. For example, consider the Bhagavata Purana:  
  
**Please, therefore, being blessed with many years, explain to us, in an easily understandable way, what you have ascertained to be the absolute and ultimate good for the people in general. (Bhagavata Purana)**

  
But now, consider the Skanda Purana:  
  
**Please narrate to us the greatness of Lord Shiva, who carries a trident in his hand. We would like to hear about the merit achieved by worshiping him and meditating upon his pastimes. (Skanda Purana)**  
  
As you can see, the Bhagavata begins with a question that is quite general, ie, what is the greatest good for all and then only goes on to talk about vAsudevA, the son of devaki. But in the Skanda Purana, the rishis asked a specific question, rather than a general one, and had a biased opinion about Shiva already in their mind, so they started with a question asking the greatness of Shiva rather than an unbiased enquiry of the ultimate truth.   
  
See the introduction to Shiva Purana, where the sages pose the question to Romaharshana:  
  
**You have taught us a lot, but we are still not satisfied.  You have had the fortune of studying under Vedavyasa and there is nothing that you do not know, past, present or future.  Tell us about Shiva, we do not know very much about Shiva. (Shiva Purana)**  
  
The same biased inquiry again. This proves that the nature of brahma jignyAsa in the tAmasa purAnAs is kuTarka and tAmasic as opposed to the sAttvika purAnAs.  
  
**Since knowledge gained by a biased question is obviously biased and hence a form of tAmas, these purAnAs are classified as ‘tAmasa purAnAs’.**    
  
  
**4) The confusion of the tAmasa purAnAs**  
  
The same tAmasa purAnAs that belittle Vishnu also contain statements like ‘In Sri Vaikunta, the supreme abode, the liberated serve the Lord and his devotees’ (shiva purAnA)’. Similar statements like ‘Achyuta is superior to Brahma and Rudra’ occur in other tAmasa purAnAs.  
  
This shows that these purAnAs are confused with respect to the knowledge they advocate. They mix the right meanings of ShAstra (such as the above quotes) now and then with the largely tAmasic portions. In contrast, the sAttvika purAnAs like Vishnu and Bhagavata PurAnAs are consistent with respect to the supremacy of Vishnu.   
  
**Since confusion arises from and is a form of tAmas, these purAnAs are classified as ‘tAmasa purAnAs’**.  
  
_%%% Note: In this context, I would like to point out the following extract from Madhva's Brahma Sutra Bhashya (Translation by Prof. Pandurangi) first adhyaya, first pada, first sutra (1.1.1) :_

  
_"Also in the Skanda Purana celebrating the supremacy of Siva, this is said:_  
_'O, Undecaying One, the moment thou shouldst, in wrath, turn thy face away from them, Brahma, Isana, and other gods would be doomed to miseries worse than those inflicted upon the basest of the base';_  
_and in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana which seeks to extol Brahma, it is said:_  
_'Neither I nor Siva nor others can lay claim to even a small fraction of his power. As a child sports with its toys, so does Achyuta with us.'_  
_And no such statement is to be found in the works declaring the supremacy of Vishnu,..._    
  
  
**5) Following the path of the wise with respect to the purAnAs**     
  
The Bhagavad Gita states that it is not enough if the shAstra states something. One must first look to see if great personalities accept this and follow it in practice. Then, one must emulate such mahAtmAs.  

  

In accordance to this, one can clearly see that Sri Adi Shankara has never used the tAmasa purAnAs in his bhAshyas as authority.

  

_%%% Note: By this, we mean that Adi Shankara, in his prasthAna traya bhAShyas where any discussion of the nature of Brahman is taken up, never uses the sections in Tamasa Puranas that celebrate the supremacy of Siva and others, such as Shankara Samhita, Suta Samhita, Shiva Gita, Shiva Sahasranama, Devi Mahatmya, etc._

  

No vedAntin with the exception of Appayya Dikshitar (whose theories were soundly refuted) have ever given weight to the absurd stories contained in the tAmasa purAnAs nor given them authority. And nobody has opposed their decision to do so as well, which shows that such a practice was well accepted at that time as traditional.  
  
**But this does not mean we must reject the tAmasa purAns wholly. They are authoritative so long as they do not contradict shruti.**     
  

Puranas are classified into Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The Rajas and Tamas puranas are not authentic because they are veda virodha. But this does not mean they are entirely to be rejected. There are often sattvik portions in rajasa and tamasa puranas which are accepted. Examples include the ones stated in point 4) of this article, such as praise of Vishnu as parabrahman as well as some portions such as Sri VenkatAchala mAhAtmyam and BrindAranya Kshetra mAhAtmyam in BrahmAnda purAna and others. Indeed, sri rAmAnuja, sri parAshara bhattar as well as srI mAdhva have quoted these sAttvic portions from the tAmasa purAnAs.

  

Similarly, the sAttvik puranas are not of the form of pure sattva, but only mishra sattva (sattva mixed with rajas and tamas). So, even the sAttvik puranas may contain a little amount of Rajas and Tamas. For instance, some chapters of Padma Purana are veda virodha. But for the greater part, that purana is sattvik. Since the tamasic and rAjasic portion of this purAnA are minimal, and sAttvik portion is greater, the purAnA is classified as ‘sAttvik’ overall.

  

This is also why Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas are praised as the greatest of even the Sattvik puranas, because they are the most sattvik of all. The tAmasic/rAjasic content in them is almost nil.

  
  
**6) The position of the purAnAs and their validity**     
  

The purAnAs have a lower position than the IthihAsA and Shruti. **But they are accepted so long as they do not contradict the Veda and IthihAsA.** 

  

The classification and the slokas that describe such a classification are not interpolations. They are genuine as can be seen from this article.

  

The reason for such tAmasa purAnas to exist is very simple. Our tradition is not like a school or college where everything is spoon-fed and force-fed to learners. Rather, the rishis acknowledge that there are different classes of people who adhere to certain convictions based on vAsaNa-s and karma-s. The vedA prescribes the syEna yaga for killing one’s enemies and bhagavan himself has misled asurAs as buddha. The Brahma SutrAs are not immediately crystal clear to all because they purposely hide the truths from unqualified people, thereby demanding a commentary tradition. Since people with certain inclinations would be unwilling to accept the ultimate truth straightaway, the venerable teachers have propagated even wrong knowledge such as anya devata arAdhana to ensure that these people do not fall into atheism and other worse paths, but atleast retain conviction in these anya devata and the wrong stories in the tAmasa purAnAs. Eventually, by the favour of these very devatas and mainly by the grace of Achyuta, they will come to a birth where they realise “**vAsudeva sarvam idam**”.

  

Therefore, the authority of the trifold classification of purAnAs is established.

    

#### Tamasa Puranas: Additional Content Analysis

Dear all,  
  
We have been reading the actual shlokas from shiva purANa, linga purANa, etc that describe the tAmasic incidents like lingOdbhava, Siva-pUja using vishNu's eye, etc. It is very amusing to see that if Shaivas were to claim these incidents as pramANa, then they have to accept the supremacy of Hari in some way. Because these purANAs, while trying to deny his supremacy, inadvertently reveal his supreme attributes here and there even in those incidents!

  

These purANAs are meant for people with aversion to the Supreme Lord nArAyaNa and thus contain stories contradictory to the Vedas. The stories are to be considered as “arthavAda” for glorification of a particular deity (like Shiva) for the sake of people inclined to such deities.

In that sense, these purANAs do have certain instances of sattva as follows:

- They contain certain statements such as the following which are perfectly vaidika and prove vishNu alone is supreme:
    

  

vaikunthE pare lOkE sriyA sArdhaM jagatpatiH |

astE viSnur acintyAtmA bhaktair bhAgavataiH saha||~ Linga purANa

  

Which says that shrI vaikuntha is the supreme abode where vishNu, along with his consorts who are nitya sUrIs themselves (shrI, bhU and nIla –mentioned in the AgamAs as well) are surrounded by “bhaktAs” and “bhAgavatAs”.

  

- General topics like etymology of names, etc is quite acceptable.
    

These two points were covered in the previous article. In this small write-up, we will show a third way  as to how these purANAs are useful.  This is something that has been mentioned by sri Vaishnava acharyas. We will address the tAmasic stories themselves.

The idea is that these purANAs, despite trying to elevate other deities over vishNu, nonetheless end up indicating the supremacy of Hari indirectly even in incidents which glorify Shiva and denigrate Hari. Thus, these episodes become indirect upabrahmaNAs for certain tattvas promoted by the shruti.

We will take up the two major stories of lingOdbhava and SivArAdhana for consideration.

LINGODBHAVA IN THE SHIVA PURANA

As we all know, this story undisputedly aims to promote the supremacy of shiva over brahma and vishNu. Let us however, look at certain shlOkas embedded in this incident as described by the shiva purANa.

The story starts as a dialogue/argument between Brahma and Vishnu as to who is superior. The purANa quotes vishNu as saying the following:

matsthaṃ jagadidaṃ vatsa manuṣe tvaṃ hi coravat //  
mannābhikamalājjātaḥ putrastvaṃ bhāṣase vṛthā // (Shiva Purana 1.6.7)

Vishnu: O Dear One (Brahma), the whole Universe is situated within me but your way of thinking is like that of a thief. You are born of the lotus from my navel. You are my son. Your words are futile therefore. (Ch 6.7)

Note: Vishnu labels Brahma a thief, for those who seek that which belongs to the Lord, namely, themselves and the objects of the Universe, as their own, are thieves. But even so, bhagavAn is “akruraH” and never openly derides another person like this, even if said person had ego. Remember he massaged the feet of Bhrigu who kicked him. This alone shows that this story did not happen, but is entirely tAmasic. Nonetheless, we can take whatever tattva doesn’t contradict shruti.

In this shloka, vishNu claims to be the controller of the Universe as it is situated in his navel. Keep that in mind for now.

Then Vishnu and Brahma fight. Upon which Shiva manifests in the form of a fiery Linga. Brahma and Vishnu take the guise of a swan and a boar to measure the top and bottom respectively.

Brahma is unable to reach the top of the Linga, but he utters a falsity that he has seen the top of the Linga. Hari takes it to be true and eulogizes Brahma. Then Shiva appears and speaks to him. Among the things he says, one of the statements below:

vatsaprasanno 'smi hare yatastvamīśatvamicchannapi satyavākyam //  
brūyāstataste bhavitā janeṣu sāmyaṃ mayā satkṛtirapyalapthāḥ // (Shiva Purana 1.7.31)

(Siva says:) O Hari, I am pleased with you because despite your desire to be “Isa” or a Ruler, you are of true words. Hence among the general public you shall have a footing equal to mine. You will be honored too likewise (ie, everyone will worship you also in temples, etc).

Let us forget the supremacy of Shiva being claimed here, as it is a tAmasa purANa and thus will not do anything else. However, one must notice here that Shiva admits that Vishnu has adhered to the truth. What does this imply?

It implies that bhagavAn vishNu is of true words. So, that in turn means that what Vishnu said about the whole Universe situated in him earlier, is true, for he is not prone to lies. Which again  makes him the Supreme Lord, as he had declared himself to be so.

Shiva does say “despite your desire to be a Lord”, implying that Vishnu is not the highest. But this is not surprising as it is the nature of the story –it is tAmasa and thus seeks to degrade Vishnu. The point to note is that inadvertently, it has admitted the kalyANa guNa of bhagavAn – that he is established in Truth. Thus, even his desire to be an “ISa” is to be taken as rooted in Truth no matter what Shiva thinks! For it is not possible that someone is hailed as truthful and yet untruthfully claims himself as a Lord!

Even this purANa does not dare to paint bhagavAn in a bad light as a liar, although it refers to Brahma as untruthful. The tAmasa purANa even denigrates vishNu in a vile manner by using terminologies like “eunuch” and so on, but it does not deny his auspicious qualities like being of truthful speech. And if bhagavAn is not a liar, and is of true speech, then whatever he says and does is true. Which makes his declaration as the One in whom the Universe is stationed, as well as his desire to be a Lord of all, are all true!

In which case, the words of Shiva become an indirect supporting proof of the following ithihAsa shlOka:

Satye pratisthitah Krishnah satyam asmin pratihthitam |

Sattasatte ca govindah tasmat Satyah satam matah ||(~mahAbhArata Udyoga Parva 69.12)

Meaning: Lord Krishna is rooted in Satya, and the Truth (Satya) is rooted in Lord Krishna. The sentients and insentients are both established in Lord Govinda. Hence He is called ‘Satya’ or ‘Truth’. (These are the words of Sanjaya to Dhridarashtra on why Krishna is called Satya).

Thus, Shiva saying vishNu is “satyavAkyaM” is a simple admission of the Lord being rooted in Truth always, which makes his desire to be an “ISa” true and appropriate to his nature. This is the absurd self-contradiction of Lingodbhava in the Shiva Purana!

LINGODBHAVA IN THE LINGA PURANA

In elaborating the tale of Lingodbhava, this purANa begins with a description of the Lord prior to creation as follows:

ekārṇave mahāghore tamobhūte samantataḥ /  
suṣvāpāṃbhasi yogātmā nirmalo nirupaplavaḥ // LiP_1,17.10 //  
sahasraśīrṣā viśvātmā sahasrākṣaḥ sahasrapāt /

mām ihāntaḥsmitaṃ kṛtvā guruḥ śiṣyamivānagha /  
kartāraṃ jagatāṃ sākṣāt prakṛteś ca pravartakam // LiP_1,17.20 //  
sanātanamajaṃ viṣṇuṃ viriñciṃ viśvasaṃbhavam /  
viśvātmānaṃ vidhātāraṃ dhātāraṃ paṅkajekṣaṇam // LiP_1,17.21 //

Brahma says: (Prior to creation) it was terribly dark all around. Everything was a vast sheet of water. In that water, the Lord whose nature is of being the means (yOgAtma), devoid of impurities and one who is free of calamities had gone to sleep. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet and a thousand arms. He, the Universal self, omniscient, the source and origin of all, was characterized by rajas, tamas and sattva in the forms of Brahma, Rudra and Vishnu. He was omnipresent and the great lord (Maheshvara) in view of being the self of all. He was the Self of time, with the Universe which is “death” (kAla) as it is the place of samsAra, in his lotus, Narayana, the one of great arms, the Self of all, who constitutes the sentients and insentients….(etc etc)

Note that even before the appearance of the Linga, this Purana has contradicted itself by eulogizing Vishnu in terms which can only denote the Supreme Deity who has no-one above him! And this description of vishNu is perfectly in tune with the vedAntic description of Parabrahman.

Also note that this tAmasa purANa, while describing Lingodbhava, has openly referred to nArAyaNa as “mahEshvara”, thus showing he alone is the referent of the name in shruti! So much for Shaiva claims that the name can only belong to their deity, even the linga purANa in the context of lingodbhava attributes the name to vishNu!

The Linga Purana continues by saying that this deity is the lotus-eyed one. Brahma also calls him eternal. Vishnu then says:

Gist of this is: “Know that I am the cause of the creation and annihilation of the Universe. O sinless one (Brahma), you address me as a preceptor would address a disciple. But I am the creator of the Universe, the prompter of prakrti, the eternal, unborn Supreme Brahman, the origin and self of the Universe. I am the lotus eyed Lord……..(etc etc)”

Vishnu continues by saying – “I am the creator, preserver and destroyer of the Universe” etc and describes his supremacy with adjectives like iShaNa, Achyuta, etc. It is more of the same, so we can skip it for brevity.

Then the Purana says that Vishnu and Brahma start fighting, upon which a fiery linga arises, and the usual story of how neither of them could find the beginning or end of it, and Shiva is hailed as the Supreme, with Vishnu singing praises of Shiva. There is a long stuti in which Vishnu addresses Shiva as the supreme. That is of course mandatory, as it is the nature of this purANa.

There is a point to note regarding the “stuti” of Hari to Shiva. While the adjectives used in the above shlOkas for Hari conform to vedAnta, the stuti of Shiva is very general. It of course describes him as creator, preserver and destroyer, infinite, etc…but there is no distinct vedAntic philosophy to glean out of it. No specific reference to sharIrAtma bhAva or anything else which is a staple of vedAnta. This is actually the character of these shiva-stutis everywhere in the tAmasa purANAs – they are general in proclaiming him as Parabrahman, but have no real substance in them. It is like a poet praising a King – just adjectives without a philosophy which are exaggerations or arthavAda.

Compare this to say, the dhruva stuti of vishNu in the vishNu purANa which is full of majestic vedAntArthAs.

Once the Shiva stuti was completed, Shiva addresses Vishnu thus:

pralayasthitisargāṇāṃ kartā tvaṃ dharaṇīpate /  
vatsa vatsa hare viṣṇo pālayaitaccarācaram // LiP_1,19.11 //

“O Lord of Bhumi Devi (dharaNipatE), you are the doer of dissolution, preservation and creation. O Hari, protect this Earth with all its’ mobile and immobile beings.”

Shiva then declares himself to be supreme, who has divided himself into 3 forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. He then tells vishNu to free himself of delusion and protect the worlds and Brahma. That is obviously the object of the story, to denigrate Vishnu. However, it contradicts the very shloka above where Rudra called Vishnu is the creator, preserver and destroyer as well as the protector!

If vishNu is indeed the “karta” of creation, preservation and destruction as Rudra claims, then it makes him the Parabrahman, as “jagatkAraNatva” is the primary lakShaNa for paratva. Although Rudra says in the next shloka that he divided himself into brahma, vishNu and rudra, it does not make sense in the presence of this shloka.

The following contradictions occur:

- If it is argued that vishNu being “kartA” means he is an “agent” or vibhUti who creates, preserves and destroys, then that means Brahman (Rudra) is pretty inactive, if he is using an agent for everything! While the Supreme Brahman can create and destroy through agents, he himself should be a protector, as it is not possible to ascribe all functions to vibhUtis.
    

  

- If vishNu alone creates, preserves and destroys, what is the need for Rudra to then say “I divide myself as brahma, vishNu, rudra”? What are the functions of Brahma and Rudra, and what is the function of this “sadA-shiva” who has given away all functions of Parabrahman to a vibhUti.
    

  

- Furthermore, a vibhUti of Brahman cannot be “sahasrasIrsha” or “sahasrAksha” as that signifies him being the sarvAntaryAmin.
    

- If it is argued that Rudra=VishNu, that goes contradictory to the entire incident which claimed vishNu was deluded, which would then attribute delusion to Rudra as well. Brahman cannot suffer delusion.
    

For, if Rudra had said vishNu is only the protector, and not the creator or destroyer, that would be consistent with sada-shiva-tUriya-vAda denigrating vishNu (even there, a major contradiction arises as none other than the Supreme can be a protector/preserver, which is why bhagavAn does not allot that role to a jIva!) . However, vishNu cannot be a vibhUti of rudra, and yet be the creator, preserver and destroyer, all in one. That makes him Brahman. In that case, he is either superior to Rudra or equal to him.

If he is equal to Rudra, it raises a further contradiction as to what Rudra’s role in the Universe is. If vishNu is the creator, preserver and destroyer, as well as “sahasrasIrsha” etc, what is the need for Rudra’s form then, does vishNu’s delusion accrue to Rudra, etc? Basically it is a bundle of contradictions.

The important takeaway from this Purana is that Rudra has not contradicted what was said earlier. If Vishnu is indeed the thousand armed, thousand eyed, etc., it means he is the sarvAntaryAmin as the heads, eyes of all beings are his. And if he is both the sarvAntaryAmin and the protector, he is the Supreme Brahman. He is also hailed as the creator, preserver and destroyer. In addition, the Purana while describing Vishnu also hails him as free of impurities, which contradicts with Rudra saying he was deluded earlier. So, despite this story elevating Rudra above Vishnu, the declaration of Vishnu as “sahasrasIrsha” etc is a direct upabrahmaNa for the Purusha Sukta and other such portions!

It is not possible for a lesser being to be eulogized as sahasra-sIrsha, etc, and hailed as the creator, preserver and destroyer. For if Vishnu is a just an agent, he should not be entrusted with all the acts of creation, preservation and destruction. So if vishNu is lower to Rudra, then it implies someone other than the Supreme Brahman is doing all the acts of creating, preserving and destroying as well as protecting the Universe and Rudra has no role. If Rudra is verily Vishnu, there is no purpose of rudra-rUpa then, when Vishnu alone is doing everything and any delusion attributed to vishNu accrues to Rudra as well. Thus, the tAmasatva of this story is clearly established, and the Supremacy of Vishnu alone comes out of this in an indirect manner.

SIVA-PUJA WITH THE EYE AS A LOTUS

The story is seen in the Linga purANa as follows:

evaM nAmnAM sahasreNa tuShTAva vRRiShabhadhvajam||

snApayAmAsa cha vibhuH pUjayAmAsa paMkajaiH |

  

In this way Vishnu pleased Siva whose flag is the Bull. Vishnu did Abhisheka of Siva and worshipped with lotus flowers.

  

parIkShArthaM hareH pUjAkamaleShu maheshvaraH ||

gopayAmAsa kamalaM tadaikaM bhuvaneshvaraH |

  

Siva the Lord of the Worlds hid one lotus flower from the Puja lotus flowers to test Vishnu.

  

hRRitapuShpo haristatra kimidaM tvabhyachintayat ||

Vishnu was missing one lotus and thought 'How has it happened?'

  

j~nAtvA svanetramuddhRRitya sarvasattvAvalambanam |

pUjayAmAsa bhAvena nAmnA tena jagadgurum ||

  

Vishnu plucked out His own eye and offered it in the worship with devotion to the Jagadguru Siva.

  

tatastatra vibhurdRRiShTvA tathAbhUtaM haro harim |

tasmAdavatatArAshu maNDalAt pAvakasya cha ||

  

Siva saw Vishnu in that condition without the eye and immediately appeared in the Fire Altar.

  

j~nAtaM mayedamadhunA devakAryaM janArdana |

sudarshanAkhyaM chakraM cha dadAmi tava shobhanam ||

  

Siva said - I know You have to do the work of the gods. I will give You the Sudarshana Chakra.

  

netraM cha netA jagatAM prabhurvai padmasannibham |

tadAprabhRRiti taM prAhuH padmAkShamiti suvratam ||

  

The Lord of the World also gave back the lotus like eye to Vishnu. From that time people call Vishnu padmAksha or kamalanayana.

  

Let us ignore this entire incident which as usual is tAmasa and is merely an arthavAda to glorify Shiva for the purpose of people with tamO guNa vAsanas .

The main takeaway is that this story admits that people call vishNu “padmAksha” or “kamalanayana”, ie, the lotus eyed one and that his eyes resemble a lotus. So, that means the Being described in the ChandOgya as “tasya yathA kapyAsam puNdareekamEvamakshiNI:” can only refer to the Lord who is lotus-eyed as per this incident!

In other words, this story seeking to denigrate vishNu becomes an upabrahmaNa for the ChAndogya Upanishad in identifying the lotus eyed Lord alone as Parabrahman, and not Shiva or any other deity who doesn’t have lotus eyes according to this story. This is the absurd contradiction of the purANa.

So what is the purpose of this write-up?

- Besides the proof given in the “tAmasatva of purANAs” article, this is further proof of the tAmasatva of these stories. While seeking to denigrate vishNu, they inadvertently admit certain auspicious qualities of the Lord that are indicative of his supremacy.
    

  

- As such, these self-contradictory stories are no more than “arthavAda” to promote worship of a particular deity for those who have tamo guNa.
    

  

- All the purANAs were first narrated by Brahma. When Brahma is overcome by tamo guNa, he narrated the tAmasa purANAs.
    

  

- The narration of Brahma in his tAmasic mood is such that he, while beginning the story in a manner that is almost truthful, diverts to glorifying another deity.
    

  

- It is likely that the rishis like Suta, etc aided in the propagation of these stories as well for the sake of loka-kShema, so that even those with tAmasic inclinations can follow these stories.
    

  

- None of the Vaidikas admit the historicity of these stories, but they recognize that these purANAs do inadvertently confirm certain truths of shruti and thus quote those parts occasionally, like Sridhara did in his vishNu purANa vyAkhyana. They recognize the little merit these stories have in this manner.
    

In conclusion, these purANAs perfectly embody the traits bhagavAn has described in the gIta:

adharmaM dharmamiti yA manyate tamasA.a.avRRitA|

sarvArthAnviparItAMshcha buddhiH sA pArtha tAmasI|| (~Gita 18.32)

That Buddhi is of the nature of Tamas which is 'enveloped in Tamas' and 'reverses every value.' The meaning is that it regards Adharma as Dharma and Dharma as Adharma, existent as non-existent, and non-existent as existent, and higher truth as the lower and the lower truth as the higher, and thus reverses every value.

These stories are a perfect example of the above.

A SHORT NOTE ON SHANKARA-NARAYANA AVATARA

A small observation on another topic. There is a pAsuram by peyazhwar in mUnrAm thiruvandhAdhi as follows:

thaazh sadaiyum neeN mudiyum ON mazhuvum sakkaramum

soozh aravum pon Naanum thONRumAl soozhum

thiraNdu aruvi pAyum thiru malai mEl enthaikku

irAndu uruvum ONRAy isainthu

Meaning: The matted hair that hang down to his neck, the tall crown, the beautiful weapon called mazhuvu (axe), the chakrayudha,  the nAgABaraNa worn as ornaments,  the golden waist band  -- these two forms opposed to one another are seen as one form in my swAmi who resides in tirumalai form where streams flow down on all sides.

This pAsuram is not saying Lord venkateshwara is half-vishNu, half-shiva as some dvEshIs think. The same azhwar declares Shiva is subservient to bhagavAn in many places.

Azhwar is simply saying, “the Lord who resides in Tirumala, is the same one who took an avatara as “Shankara-Narayana” once, as he exhibits the same sousIlya guNa”. Explanation as below.

The acharyas comment on this pAsuram by saying that among the avatArAs of the Lord, one is called “Harihara” or “Shankaranarayana”. Bhagavan wanted to enlighten a rishi once that those who worship Rudra, are worshipping him in reality, as he, being Rudra’s antaryAmin, is the true granter of boons. So, bhagavAn assumed a form that was half-vishNu, half-shiva and appeared before the rishi. The attributes of vishNu were on the right side, while the attributes normally seen in shiva were on his left side.

This is not some “fusion”. ShrI periyavAcchan pillai clarifies here – Just as Narasimha is a man-lion form that wholly the lord and not the fusion of some random lion with him, similarly this Harihara rupa is wholly his, and it does not involve Shiva at all.

The purpose of this was to demonstrate the “sAdhaka rUpa” and the “siddha rUpa”, as Rudra meditates on nArAyaNa. Thus, Hari has all the attributes and it is by his accessibility that people gain their desires even if they worship Rudra.

It does not mean ShrI venkatEshwara has this form at Tirumala. In the previous pAsuram, azhwar said the Lord in other temples was the same as Trivikrama, etc. It only means, the Lord who resides in that temple, is the same as Trivikrama in guNAs. Similarly, the Lord who resides in Tirumala, has the same guNa of accessibility that ShankaranArAyaNa avatAra exhibited.

The tAmasa purANAs contain descriptions of Hari-Hara as fusions of Shiva and Vishnu which is avaidika and are not the same as this ShankaranArAyaNa avatAra.  

Just a small note on the issue.
