#### Prelude to the Ishvara Gita - Jnana Yoga

We will soon be publishing a translation of the Ishvara Gita from the Kurma Purana on this blog. As it is a complicated text, we thought it would be wise to release a series of smaller articles as preludes, to enable an understanding of the fundamentals that the work is based on. This is the first of the preludes. Here, we will explain what Jnana-Yoga is according to the Shastra, as it is relevant to the Ishvara Gita.  

Jnana-Yoga is realization of the individual self. Among the various puruṣārthas that can be attained, the intrinsic bliss of the individual self is sought after by some. This is brought out in the following Gita shloka:

catur-vidha bhajante mam janah sukrtino 'rjuna arto jijnasur artharthi jnani ca bharatarsabha (Gita 7.16)

Meaning: Some people seek refuge in me, to attain the wealth they had lost (arta) and some for acquiring new possessions (artārtin). Still some others take refuge in me to experience the individual self (jijnāsu). Some noble persons do self-surrender to me to attain me (jnāni). All these four types of people are of meritorious deeds.

Shankaracharya and Madhvacharya interpret “jijnāsu” as “One who seeks knowledge of Brahman” and “jnāni” as “One who has attained knowledge of Brahman”. This is wrong. This is because Bhagavan is dividing these noble people into four classes based on 4 different goals they seek. If jijnāsu and jnāni bear the meanings given by Shankaracharya and Madhvacharya, then it means both have the same goal of Brahman – as one is seeking Brahman and the other has attained Brahman. So, the classification itself is thwarted. Hence, “jijnāsu” means a seeker of the individual self which is a different goal to that of the “jnāni” who seeks to attain Brahman.

Moving on - Since the self is jnānānandamaya, it can be realized, perceived and experienced, as divested of prakrti. This Jnana-Yoga can be of two types – it can be a gateway to Bhakti-Yoga, since self-realization should result in a realization of the Lord who is the indweller of the self. And thus a Jnana Yogi can progress to Bhakti Yoga. Alternatively, Jnana-Yoga is an end in itself for those who consider experience of the individual self as their sole aim.

This Jnana-Yoga has Karma-Yoga, which is performance of desireless works, as its’ accessory. Since it is very difficult to attain the state of meditation on the self, Karma-Yoga is performed. The aspirant performs all duties to engage his senses and at the same time, he is constantly thinking of the self as different from the body. So, he does not hanker after the fruits of the works. This eventually allows him to attain the state of meditation constituting Jnana-Yoga.

Alternatively, Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that one can attain the experience of the individual self by Karma-Yoga, skipping the need for Jnana-Yoga. Because a Karma-Yogi is also constantly contemplating on the self as distinct from the body while doing actions – it thus has a knowledge component to it. Thus, this is a much easier path than Jnana-Yoga to attain the same goal.

To attain an experience of the self, it is not possible to constantly fix the mind on the individual self. So the only means to attain such an experience of the self is to meditate on the Lord. The idea is, one must meditate on the auspicious body of the Lord, using the praṇava, to wean one’s senses away from sense objects. By meditating on the Lord, one attains the highest similarity with him in the form of experience of the individual self. Thus, pranavopāsaṇa is thus an important anga of Jnana-Yoga.

This is mentioned in Gita 8.13 as follows,

om ity ekaksaram brahma vyaharan mam anusmaran yah prayati tyajan deham sa yati paramam gatim

Meaning: Constantly uttering “OM” which denotes me, the Brahman, and contemplating me, if a person fixes his life-force in the head and departs from the body, he attains the highest state which is the experience of the pure individual self that is similar to my form.

“paramam gatim” here means he attains the goal of the pure self, which is higher than other goals such as material objects, svarga etc under the dominion of the Lord. The pure self is immutable in nature, all-pervasive in knowledge, devoid of karmas and hence is similar to the Lord.

Jnana-Yoga has 4 very important stages. These stages are described by Sri Krishna in the Gita as follows:

Stage 1: The First Stage of Equality – Gita 6.29: The first stage of equality is that the Yogi sees equality everywhere. He sees himself in all other selves and all selves in him. Meaning, he sees that all selves are of identical natures everywhere and there is no difference between them, just as there is no difference between grains of rice which are identical. Differences of man, deva etc lie in the body. Thus, he sees himself everywhere in the same manner as one says, “this is the same rice that I saw in another place”. This is sameness or oneness of vision with all Jivas.

Stage 2: The Second Stage of Equality – Gita 6.30: He sees the Lord in all the selves and all the selves in the Lord. Meaning, just as he sees similarity between himself and the selves, he sees similarity between himself and the Lord. Both the Jivatma (in the liberated state) and Paramatma are devoid of karma. Thus, the Jnana-Yogi does not see himself as different from Paramatma on that account. This is sameness or oneness of vision with the Lord.

Stage 3: The Third Stage of Equality – Gita 6.31:  The phrase “ekatvamāstithaḥ” is used by the Lord here. In the second stage, the Jnana-Yogi realized his similarity with Paramatma in terms of both being outside the sway of karmas. Now, when karmas are removed, the Jivatma has uncontracted and all-pervasive knowledge (dharma-bhUta-jnAna). Bhagavan also has uncontracted all-pervasive knowledge. Thus, the Yogi increases his feeling of similarity with Paramatma here. He thinks, “As Bhagavan and I both have uncontracted knowledge, both are similar”.  Just as Paramatma pervades all things, the Jiva pervades all things by his knowledge. Though the mode of pervasion is different, the similarity is focused on. In this state, the Jnana-Yogi even says, “I am that Paramatma” – meaning, “I am verily similar to that Paramatma”. This is like saying, “This rice in shop A is the same as the rice in Shop B”. Though there are two different rice grains, they are claimed to be the same due to similarity. This is the higher state of sameness or oneness of vision with the Lord.

Stage 4: The Fourth Stage of Equality – Gita 6.32: In this state, the Jnana-Yogi has identified himself as all the other selves to such an extent, on account of similarity of natures, that he even considers the joys and sorrows of others as his own. This is the apex of Jnana-Yoga.

Jnana-Yoga is not just a separate means to experience the self. Both karma and jnana-yogas are accessories to bhakti-yoga as well. Upon realizing the nature of the self as distinct from the body, one then realizes the self is subservient to the Lord, who is the indweller of the self and hence has the self as his body. This then leads naturally to bhakti-yoga.

However, those seeking to only experience the bliss of the self, do not wish to progress to bhakti-yoga and hence do not meditate on the subservience (seshatva) of the self.

Thus, this is a brief description of ātmopāsaṇa according to śrī rāmānuja.

 REFERENCE TO ATMOPASANA (KAIVALYA MUKTI) IN SHASTRA

The jivātmopāsaṇa is not a favorite of the Lord. Because he feels upset that people would try to attain their own intrinsic bliss as opposed to desiring to attain him! The major Upanishads, the bulk of Bhagavad Gita (barring the first 6 chapters and the 8th chapter), the īthihāsās and the major purāṇās (viśṇu and bhāgavata) focus primarily on Bhakti-Yoga and explain Jnana-Yoga mainly as an accessory to Bhakti-Yoga.  Of course, they do contain references to Jnana-Yoga as a separate path to attain the self as well.

The sahasranāma says the Lord is “muktānām paramā gatiḥ” – He is the highest goal of the muktas. This implies that there is also a lower goal for the muktas, namely, Atmanubhava, is it not? Indeed so, vide the viśṇu purāṇa,

yoginām amṛtaṃ sthānaṃ yad viṣṇoḥ paramaṃ padam // ~ (viśṇu purāṇa 1.6.38)

According to Engalazhwan, this shloka says that those yogins who (among those in their respective Asramas) do pratikopāsana (meditate using symbols)  on   the   real   nature   of   their  own  selves,  reach  the  immortal  region  (amṛtaṃ sthānaṃ)  known  as “viṣṇupada” where they meditate on the bliss of their own selves.

That this statement does not refer to Sri Vaikuntha and only refers to kaivalya mukti (bliss of the Jivatma) is seen by the very next statement of the viśṇu purāṇa:

ekāntinaḥ sadā brahmadhyāyino yogino hi ye / teṣāṃ tat paramaṃ sthānaṃ yad vai paśyanti sūrayaḥ // ~ (viśṇu purāṇa 1.6.39).

This shloka says that for those yogins who constantly meditate upon the Supreme Brahman alone, considering him alone as the means and the goal (ekāntinaḥ), is reserved that Supreme Abode of his where the Nitya Suris perpetually perceive and enjoy him (as opposed to the yogins who meditate on their intrinsic bliss in the lower abode).

The usage of “ekāntinaḥ” and “sadā brahmadhyāyino” shows that these yogins who are constantly meditating on Brahman are different from those yogins of the previous shloka who are content with the bliss of their own individual selves.

The usage of “paramaṃ sthānaṃ” (that highest abode) qualified by “sūrayaḥ” (Nitya Suris perceiving Brahman) differentiates it from the previous “amṛtaṃ sthānaṃ” which is a lower state of mukti. The idea is, only Vishnu’s supreme abode is perceived eternally by the Nitya Suris like Adi Sesha, Garuda, etc. And thus “sadā pashyanti suraya:” is a distinguishing feature of Paramapada from Kaivalya Mukti.

The procedure of Jnana-Yoga as a separate means to attain the self (and not as an accessory to Bhakti-Yoga) is described in voluminous detail in other shruti and smriti as follows:

- Kurma Purana – 2 sections in pūrva and uttara bhāga (we will get to this)
    

  

- Garuda Purana – You can read a rough translation of Jnana-Yoga here - [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/gpu18.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/gpu18.htm). Don’t be fooled thinking this section refers to the Lord – it is an account of yoga performed to attain individual self, which is “moksha” or liberation from the distress of samsāra considering the self is higher than material objects. The Lord is describing the individual self by those adjectives to Garuda.
    

  

- Vayu Purana – The adhyāyās on pāśupata yoga or māheśvarya yoga are  sāttvika and describe Jnana-yoga. This section has been wrongly assumed by Shaivas to refer to rudra. The terms “paṣupati” and “maheśvara” are applicable to the individual self, as it is the master of the senses or mind that are associated with anger or attachments (paṣupati) and it is the great ruler of the mind, senses and body (maheśvara). We will see these in detail later.
    

  

- A few smaller Upanishads, which we will comment on later.
    

  

- And of course, in some of the major Upanishads like the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka, the chapters 1-6 of Bhagavad Gita, as well as aksharOpAsaNa in chapter 8.
    

  

ROLE OF SHIVA IN ATMOPASANA

Shiva is a bestower of knowledge regarding Brahman. He imparts the tāraka mantra (praṇava) to seekers of the individual self at the time of death, because Brahman and praṇavopāsaṇa is the means to attain the individual self. Thus, he is a mediator in this type of upāsaṇa.

In fact, the Vayu Purana, in the pāṣupata yoga adhyāya (also called māhEśvarya yoga), says that those seeking the individual self, having conquered material attachments, are exalted in rudra-loka:

etena vidhinā yogo virakta sukśmavarjitaṃ prakrtiṃ samatikramya rudraloko mahīyate (~Vayu Purana 12.35)

Meaning:  The Yogi, by this procedure (of Jnana-Yoga), becomes detached from desire for material objects and being devoid of the (afflictions of) the senses constituted of the subtle elements, he crosses over prakrti (ie, attains experience of the individual self which is higher than prakrti) and is joyous or exalted in Rudra Loka.

The Yogis are said to cross over prakrti as they eschew material objects and attain the self which is higher than prakrti. It does not imply liberation.

Thus, they attain Shiva’s abode and partake of his knowledge to attain the individual self. This has again been wrongly understood by Shaivas as praising Rudra Loka as a supreme abode. The Garuda Purana shloka quoted by Dvaitins also reinforce this fact:

sthitaprajño'pi yastūrdhvaḥ prāpya raudraṁ padaṁ tataḥ | sāṅkarṣaṇaṁ tato muktimagād viṣṇuprasādataḥ || (~Garuda Purana)

Meaning: “A sthitaprajña (One who is unaffected by changes due to meditation on the individual self), who is also Urdhva (one who has risen above desire), obtained (reached) the abode belonging to Rudra (raudraṁ padaṁ), then the abode of Sankarshana (sāṅkarṣaṇaṁ) and thereafter obtained mukti by the grace of vishNu”.

Note that these aspirants progress to Sankarshana Loka only if they have progressed from Jnana-Yoga to Bhakti-Yoga. In that sense, this shloka is not an absolute reference to Jnana-Yoga as a separate path, but as an accessory to bhakti-yoga. Still, the role of Rudra as helping Jnana-Yogis is clearly brought out here.

It should also be noted that it is not 100% necessary to get the help of Shiva. However, many wise sages choose to do it on account of him being a celebrated guru. Thus, the attainment of Rudraloka is only for those types of upāsakās who seek his grace and who meditate on the indweller of Rudra to attain the self. The others go to a place near Meru.

Varanasi is thus, recommended as a place of stay for such Kaivalyartis. Shiva, at the time of death, imparts the knowledge of the Lord denoted by the praṇava, which enables them to attain liberation from the distress of samsāra by experience of the individual self:

“O Pot-born Sage, without the knowledge that roots out Karmas (ie, lack of ability to undertake meditation on the self), a person who dies in Kashi attains the state of the imperishable self (amRta), with the favor of the Moon-crested Lord. With or without effort on one's part, one shall abandon the body and die in Kashi. Through the imparting of the Taraka Mantra, he shall attain the state of the individual self that is imperishable (amRta)”. (~  Chapter 30, Purvavadha , Kasi Khanda of Skanda Purana).

Thus, the liberation that Shiva grants is that of attainment of the individual self, not the ultimate moksha.

Some dveshis with affiliation to the Sringeri Mutt argue that the well-known claim that Shiva whispers “Rama, Rama” in the ears of the dying at Kashi is refuted by this and that “tāraka” refers to the praṇava as follows (Source: [https://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/mokshapuri.html](https://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/mokshapuri.html)):

“The Taraka Mantra referred here is Pranava and not Rama Taraka. Pranava being the first and the foremost of all the Mantras, is the true tAraka mantra. Also, the scriptures explain anusandhana of Pranava as the path to Brahma Jnana. Some claim that Lord Mahadeva utters Rama mantra in the ear of a dying person in Kashi and grants him Moksha. This seems to be the belief of only some Vaishnavaite cults and has been well publicized. Though Rama mantra Japa can lead one to a state of Shuddha Chitta, required for Jnana, it is incorrect to assume that mere recitation of Rama mantra or any other mantra on deathbed can grant one Moksha.”

Well, where is the contradiction? The Brahman who is the referent of the praṇava is none other than Rama. This is confirmed by Shiva himself, vide the pramāṇa,

“Omityevam sadā viprāh padatvam dhyāta keśavam” – “O Brahmanas! Always keep chanting “OM”. Meditate on Keshava” – These are the words of Shiva himself in the Mahabharata, who imparts the praṇava for those interested in ātmopāsaṇa.  Who is Rama, but Keshava himself!!

They are both correct. Shiva imparts the knowledge of Rama, through the tāraka mantra. As meditation on the Lord’s body is an anga of Jnana-Yoga, with praṇava japa, it is clear that Shiva, in his form as Vishvanatha at Kashi, himself meditates on the body of Rama and imparts the knowledge to those living there. Then they attain the state of meditation on the individual self, which is liberation from samsara.

ROLE OF SHATARUDRIYAM IN ATMOPASANA

There are many places in the Shastra where the Shatarudriya japa is glorified as capable of bestowing liberation. Now, there is a reason why great Acharyas like Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva have not given as much notice to the Shatarudriyam as compared to the Narayana Suktam (for instance). This is because while the Narayana Suktam is solely aimed at ascertaining the ultimate reality, the Rudram is a section that describes the qualities of the Lord to curb the distress of the senses. Thus, it has a lower level of importance than the Narayana Suktam or the Purusha Suktam, although it talks about the same Lord. The focus of the ṣatarudrīyam is not to determine the nature of the ultimate reality, but it takes the form of praise of the ultimate reality in the assumption that it is already known (as Narayana).

This is similar to the Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas. The Vishnu Purana is quoted by all Acharyas because it provides clarification on the nature of the Supreme Being. The Bhagavatam is more in the mood of someone who already knows all that, and is willing to simply immerse himself in the qualities and deeds of the Lord. Similarly, the Narayana Sukta is used to ascertain the nature of the ultimate reality, while the Rudram praises that ultimate reality which is already known, to curb the senses.

Since ātmopāsaṇa’s biggest challenge is curbing the senses, and since Shatarudriyam involves weaning the indrīyās away from sense objects to focus on the Lord whose meditation is a means to attain the individual self, the recitation of the Shatarudriyam becomes an accessory to Jnana-Yoga. It is thus glorified in Shastras wherever ātmopāsaṇa is described and its’ Japa is said to confer liberation in the sense of freedom from distress of samsara by focusing on attaining the individual self.

Thus, we will come across several places in later articles where Japa of Rudram is glorified or mentioned in connection with Jnana Yoga.

I assume this brief description of Jnana-Yoga will have enlightened readers on its’ nature to an extent. This article serves as a prelude to future articles which will dwell heavily on this particular type of Upasana. By referring to this write-up, your doubts on other future articles (if any) will be clarified.

  

#### Prelude to Ishvara Gita - Part II: A Summary of Atharvashira Upanishad

In a [previous journal post](https://narayanastra.blogspot.com/2017/12/prelude-to-ishvara-gita-jnana-yoga.html), we published a short article on the Jnana Yoga and stated that it forms an important prelude to an upcoming article on the Ishvara Gita. This post serves to provide another important prelude to the article, involving a summary of Atharvashira Upanishad. This is because the upAsana detailed in this Upanishad is related to the AtmopAsana detailed in the Ishvara Gita.  

Shri Uttamur Swami has summarized the Atharvasiras in one page in his tamil work Upanishad Saram. This post is essentially a verbatim translation of the same. Its [Tamil original can be read online in this link](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.384533/2015.384533.Upanishad-Saram#page/n199/mode/2up). This Swami has also authored a stotra called Vedanta Pushpanjali. It envisages each Upanishad as a flower and is offered to the feet of Shri Venkateswara. The section dedicated to the Atharvasiras and a few lines of explanation in Tamil can be [read online in this link](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.383349/2015.383349.Vedanta-pushpanjali#page/n127/mode/1up). We will also translate these into English in this post.

ATHARVASHIRAS - SUMMARY FROM ‘UPANISHAD SARAM’

The Devas approached Rudra in the Svarga-loka and asked him who he was. Rudra answered thus: ‘I alone was there in the beginning, am there at present, and will be in future. There is nothing else apart from me’. The Devas were perplexed as Rudra spoke the words that must be spoken by bhagavAn. They doubted whether Rudra considers himself as the Supreme, or whether he considers the Supreme Lord Narayana as his antaryAmin. Rudra then explained his first reply thus: ‘Devas! The paramAtman that you have in mind has entered what is subtler than the subtlest. He has entered all directions. Hence, I am indeed He (i.e., He is my antaryAmin). Thus, I am the all that is eternal, all that is perceivable and imperceptible, and so on (i.e., the antaryAmin of everything is my antaryAmin).’  Rudra answered in this manner due to the nature of his meditation on bhagavAn as his own antaryAmin and as the antaryAmin of everything. Indeed, Vamadeva and Prahlada also have stated thus (in the shruti and smR^iti, respectively). By this, Rudra announces himself as an adhikAri who performs bhagavad bhakti.

In the second kANDa, the Devas praise and worship bhagavAn as their respective antaryAmin, in the manner that Rudra stated earlier. In the third, the praNava that signifies bhagavAn was named variously. In the fourth, those names were explained. In the fifth, the upAsana of bhagavAn as Rudra’s antaryAmin was introduced and specified as a way of bhakti. In it, wearing of the bhasma with mantras was also specified as a vow. Finally, the greatness of bhagavAn and the result of this upAsana were explained.

As stated in the upaniShad, the upAsaka who meditates on bhagavAn as the antaryAmin  of Rudra has to perform bhasma-dhAraNa as part of it. The bhakti-yogi can do this, just as he can meditate on bhagavAn as the antaryAmin of Indra, Brahma, and Surya. Those who are unclear of this will tend to think that the upaniShad says it is appropriate to worship Rudra as the Supreme in the manner of the pAshupata Agamas. If that was the case, there would be no reason for the Devas to first ask Rudra who he was. The only reason was that Rudra’s appearance and actions were different from typical Vishnu bhaktas (in terms of smearing his body with ashes, etc). Rudra’s reply was ‘My antaryAmin is the same as your antaryAmin. Hence, my deeds and attire is also a kind of upAsana’. Having learned this, the Devas praised Rudra as a Vaishnava. Our Purvacharyas have discussed this upaniShad in vedArtha saMgraha, tattvasAra, shrutaprakAshikA, and other works.

Those who read through this Upanishad superficially will think of Rudra as the Supreme. One should however note the words of Rudra ‘He has entered all. Hence, I am indeed Him and I alone am everything.’ He does not say ‘I have entered everything’, but ‘He has entered everything’. Note the third-person usage. Also, note other evidences such as the usage of the term bhagavAn  that primarily denotes Vasudeva as per the Vishnu Purana.

SOME ADDITIONAL POINTS

In the ashvamedhika parva, where bhAgavata-dharma is explained, Sri Krishna says that even those who worship Him with atharvashiras are bhAgavatas:

atharvazirasA caiva nityam AtharvaNA dvijAH

stuvanti satataM ye mAM te 'pi bhAgavatAH smRtAH

(Mahabharata, Ashvamedhika Parva, BORI 14\_004\_3378 - 14\_004\_3379)

  

Meaning: (You must) know that those AtharvaNa brAhmaNas who chant the atharvashiras daily as part of their worship of Me (KrishNa) are also bhAgavatas, my devotees.

The shruti itself (Nrsimha Purva Tapini) says that the nR^isiMha mantra is the essence of Sri Rudram, Atharvashikha, and atharvashiras.

VEDANTA PUSHPANJALI

Meaning: The Atharvashiras consists of seven kANDas detailing the following topics:

- The sarvAntarAtma stage of meditation experienced by Rudra,
    
- The praise of the Devas, after knowing that (Rudra attained that stage),
    
- The names and meanings of the syllable ‘om’, which relates to Bhagavan Sriman Narayana, and
    
- The dhyAna on Rudra’s antaryAmin performed with the wearing of ashes.
    

Thus the upaniShad explains Vishnu’s greatness.

The Devas enquired Rudra as to who he was, in other words whether he was a Vishnu bhakta or not. This is because Rudra wears ashes in contrast to others. To announce himself as a Vishnu bhakta, Rudra answered their question from the point of view of the antaryAmin, thus: “Since bhagavAn (Sriman Narayana) is the antaryAmin to myself and everything, I can say that I am everything.” Knowing thus, the devas praised him. The upAsaka who meditates on bhagavAn as Rudra’s antaryAmin must wear ashes. The mantra is praNava (the syllable ‘om’). By it, one can attain Para Vasudeva’s eternal blemishless nitya vibhUti.


  

#### Prelude to Ishvara Gita - Part III: Kurma Purana Purva Bhaga - RISHI ŚVETĀŚVATARA and the PĀŚUPATA VRATA

So far, [we have seen](http://narayanastra.blogspot.com/2018/01/in-previous-journal-post-we-published.html) Jnāna Yoga, the means to attain the experience of the self as well as the Upasana of Rudra-Shariraka-Paramatma in the Atharvasiras that has the paśupata vrata as an accessory . There is an interesting section on the Upasana of Śvetāśvatara maharishi which is linked to the Atharvasiras and the Ishvara Gita, the latter being a pending publication for the blog. So, this section is described here.

Who was Śvetāśvatara maharishi? The identity can be ascertained from the name itself. According to Sri Mahacharya, it is “śvetena aśvena tarati iti śvetāśvatara” – One who has Hayagriva as his means. The name of this rishi itself indicates he was a hayagrīva-upāsaka. So, the vaishnavatva of this rishi is self-evident.  

A short narrative regarding this rishi exists in the Kurma Purana, which we shall translate here.

Interestingly, the author of the Mahapashupatastra blog has taken this section as a pramāṇa for his beliefs that the rishi Śvetāśvatara was a Shaiva. Look at what he says here:

//Source: www.mahapashupatastra.com/2013/04/the-unborn-rudra-of-svetaswatara.html

tapasā karṣitātmānaṃ śuklayajñopavītinam ||” (Kurma Purana 1:13:31-32)

“In the meantime, he spotted the great sage 'Svetasvatara' who was the best of the 'Pasupatas (devotees of Shiva). The said ascetic had applied ashes etc....

Then look at the below verse carefully – Here Svetasvatara rishi teaches him concepts of 'pasu (bonded jiva), 'pasa (maya), and 'pati (lord Shiva)', which are typically used in Shiva's path. “aśeṣavedasāraṃ tat paśupāśavimocanam | antyāśramamiti khyātaṃ brahmādibhiranuṣṭhitam ||” //

According to our Shaiva friend, the mere application of ashes and the mention of the Paśu-Paśa-Pati concept is indicative of the rishi being a Śiva devotee. Well, what to say to that? He is surely ignorant of pramāṇas like these:

bandhako bhava paṣena bhava-paṣac ca mocakah

kaivalyadah param brahma viṣnur eva sanatanah (~skanda purANa)

“He binds the souls with the ropes (Pasha) of birth and death. He unties the ropes of birth and death that bind the souls. The supreme Brahman, eternal Lord Vishnu alone (vishnur eva) is the bestower of Mukti (kaivalya).”

In the Gita Bhashya, under "mama māya duratyaya..." it is stated that the Jivas are Paśus as they are bound and associated with anger that is likened to an animal in the Upanishads. Prakrti or Maya is the Paśa. Bhagavan Sri Krishna is Pashupati, who binds the Paśus with the Paśa of Prakrti.

That section of the Kurma Purana is Sattvika. It is a wonderful anecdote which contains the only available description of the great Maharishi Śvetāśvatara.

Our friend then adds:

//From the Kurma Purana we clearly see that sage ‘Svetaswatara’ was a devotee of Shiva and his conception of the Supreme Being was Bhagavan Shiva only. Therefore, the ‘Rudra’ of Svetasvatara Upanishad is verily umapati beyond doubt. When we have Purana itself attesting this truth, it means Vedavyasa himself is supporting this point – then why do we need to even pay attention towards the poison-hearted cunning Vaishnavas?//

Anyway, let us look at a cunning Vaishnava interpretation of the Purana below to see if it supports our friend’s absurd theories.

sa tu vainyaḥ pṛthurdhomān satyasaṃdho jitendriyaḥ /  
sārvabhaumo mahātejāḥ svadharmaparipālakaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.16 //

Meaning: Prithu, the son of Vena, was truthful, intelligent and had conquered his senses. He had sovereignty all over the Earth, being of great splendor and one who protected his svadharma (varṇāśrama dharma).

tasya bālyāt prabhṛtyeva bhaktirnārāyaṇe 'bhavat /  
govardhanagiriṃ prāpya tapastepe jitendriyaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.17 //

Meaning: He had devotion to Narayana since his childhood. Going to Govardhana, he subdued his senses and undertook a penance.

tapasā bhagavān prītaḥ śaṅkhacakragadādharaḥ /  
āgatya devo rājānaṃ prāha dāmodaraḥ svayam // KūrmP_1,13.18 //

Meaning: Bhagavan, who bears the conch, discus and mace which are ever displayed by him as ornaments for his devotees and weapons for the enemies of his devotees, was pleased by the penance. Coming in front of the King, the Lord who is called Damodara, as he was tied up by Yashoda (thus being accessible to his devotees), spoke thus.

dhramikau rūpasaṃpannau sarvaśastrabhṛtāṃ varau /  
matprasādādasaṃdigdhaṃ putrau tava bhaviṣyataḥ /  
ekamuktvā hṛṣīkeśaḥ svakīyāṃ prakṛtiṃ gataḥ // KūrmP_1,13.19 //

Meaning: By my grace, two sons shall be born to you in the future, who are virtuous, of a pleasing appearance and the best among the wielders of all weapons. Saying this, the Lord Hrishikesha who is the controller of the senses of even gods like Brahma, Rudra, etc attained his own natural condition (of not being manifest to the senses).

vainyo 'pi vedavidhinā niścalāṃ bhaktimudvahan /  
apālayat svakaṃ rājyaṃ nyāyena madhusūdane // KūrmP_1,13.20 //

Meaning: Prthu indeed had unwavering devotion in the Lord and governed his Kingdom according to the injunctions of the Vedas, constantly in contemplation of Madhusudhana (the destroyer of “Madhu”, means desire for material things as well as the Asura).

acirādeva tanvaṅgo bhāryā tasya sucismitā /  
khikhaṇḍanaṃ havirdhānamantardhānā vyajāyata // KūrmP_1,13.21 //

Meaning: His wife who had slender limbs and a smiling face gave birth to Sikhandin and Havirdhana by holding in (breath?)

śikhaṇḍano 'bhavat putraḥ suśīla iti viśrutaḥ /  
dhārmiko rūpasaṃpanno vedavedāṅgapāragaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.22 //

Meaning: The son born to Sikhandin was known as Suśīla. He was virtuous, of a pleasing appearance and had mastery of the Veda and Vedangas.

so 'dhītya vidhivad vedān dharmeṇa tapasi sthitaḥ /  
matiṃ cakre bhāgyayogāt saṃnyāṃ prati dharmavit // KūrmP_1,13.23 //

Meaning: He studied the Vedas properly and according to established rules (dharma), being situated in penance. That knower of Dharma, by the power of fortune which is the Lord’s unconditional grace or will, became inclined to renunciation (of sense-objects).

Note: This means that Suśīla had acquired knowledge of the self as distinct from the body and wanted to attain the self. He had no dehātma bhrama or desire for sense objects.

sa kṛtvā tīrthasaṃsevāṃ svādhyāye tapasi sthitaḥ /  
jagāma himavatpṛṣṭhaṃ kadācit siddhasevitam // KūrmP_1,13.24 //

Meaning: As he was eager in the discussion of the meanings of the Vedic texts (svādhyāya) and being situated in austerities (aimed at realizing the bliss of the individual self), he resorted to holy places. Once he reached the summit of the Himalaya which is visited by Siddhas.

tatra dharmapadaṃ nāma dharmasiddhipradaṃ vanam /  
apaśyad yogināṃ gamyamagamyaṃ brahmavidviṣām // KūrmP_1,13.25 //

Meaning: There, he saw a forest named Dharmapada, which conferred success in the means undertaken to achieve something (dharmasiddhipradam). This was a place that those united in meditation on the self (yogināṃ) can attain, but not to those who are hostile to the self, ie, those indulging in sense-objects (brahmavidviṣām).

tatra mandākinī nāma supuṇyā vimalā nadī /  
padmotpalavanopetā siddhāśramavibhūṣitā // KūrmP_1,13.26 //

Meaning: An auspicious, pure river named Mandakini was there. It was filled with blue and red lotuses and adorned with the Ashramas of Siddhas or those perfected in Yoga.

sa tasyā dakṣiṇe tīre munīndrairyogibhirvṛtam /  
supuṇyamāśramaṃ ramyamapaśyat prītisaṃyutaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.27 //

Meaning: On the Southern Bank, he saw an auspicious, beautiful Ashrama occupied by the foremost of those who meditate on the self (munīndrair), and those who meditate on the auspicious attributes of Brahman (yogibhirvṛtam).

Note: The idea is that the place was the habitat for both Jnāna-Yogis who meditate  on the self as well as Bhakti-Yogis who meditate on Brahman.

Alternatively, “muni” means those who meditate on the meanings of the Veda (apara-vidyā) and “yogi” means those who perform upāsaṇa (para-vidyā)

mandākinījale strātvā saṃtarpya pitṛdevatāḥ /  
arcayitvā mahādevaṃ puṣpaiḥ padmotpalādibhiḥ // KūrmP_1,13.28 //

Meaning: He took a holy dip in the waters of the Mandakini and satiated the Pitr-devatas. He worshipped Mahadeva (Śiva) with red and white lotuses and other flowers.

Note: He did not worship Mahadeva as Supreme. The idea is that, just as he propitiated the Pitr-Devatas, so did he worship Śiva as part of his regular worship. He worshipped these gods by considering them as the bodies of the Lord who is the innerself, in accordance with Gita 3.11.

Rudra is also worshipped to gain knowledge of Brahman, and thus the next shloka describes Suśīla’s worship of Brahman, succeeding his worship of Rudra.

dhyātvārkaṃsaṃsthamīśānaṃ śirasyādhāya cāñjalim /  
saṃprekṣamāṇo bhāsvantaṃ tuṣṭāva parameśvaram // KūrmP_1,13.29 //

Meaning: He meditated on īśāna, the Controller (Narayana) abiding in the orb of the Sun, joining his hands in Anjali Mudra over his head. Beholding the resplendent (inner controller of the sun), he praised the Supreme Ruler.

Note: By virtue of meditation, he could conceive the Lord within the sun.  “saṃprekṣamāṇo” refers to meditation.

rudrādhyāyena giriśaṃ rudrasya caritena ca /  
anyaiśca vividhaiḥ stotraiḥ śāṃbhavairvedasaṃbhavaiḥ // KūrmP_1,13.30 //

Meaning: He worshipped the Lord who abides in the Vedas (giriśa) by the Satarudriyam (to control his senses), by the texts such as Puranas narrating the sportive deeds of the Lord (rudra) who brings tears of joy to his devotees (for fixing the mind in Brahman) and by various kinds of praise in the form of Vedic Suktas of the Lord whose appearance causes happiness (śaṃbhu; this is done to secure the Lord as a means to attain the self).

Note: These names do not refer to Rudradeva. Note that each name is descriptive of the mode of worship detailed along with it and thus are to be treated as contextual as opposed to indicating a particular god. They thus refer to Narayana only. Furthermore, the initial section had already established that Prithu, Suśīla etc were all devotees of Bhagavan with correct knowledge.

This describes the Upasana of Suśīla to attain the individual self. The three steps in Jnāna Yoga are controlling the senses, fixing the mind on Brahman and meditating on the Lord who is the means to attain the state of the self.

He is “giriśa” – One who abides in speech which is the Vedas. Thus, he is propitiated by the Satarudriyam of the Vedas for curbing the mind and senses from sense objects. Even in the Satarudriyam, “giriśa” is used as a general term since it occurs in the context of speech “ṣivena vacasā tvā girisācca vadāmasi” which shows it is a name used on basis of context. There is no context in contrast, for interpreting this as “Lord of Kailaśa”, for Kailaśa has no relation to speech or praise. So, it refers to the Lord Narayana. This is step 1 or controlling the indrīyās from engaging in sense objects by focusing them on Brahman.

He is “Rudra” – the discussion of his exploits (carita) brings tears of joy to his devotees. This pleasing nature of the Lord’s exploits destroys sins and enables one’s mind to be fixed on Brahman. This is step 2 or fixation of mind on Brahman.

He is “śaṃbhu” – The Lord has a beautiful auspicious form that causes happiness, which is described by Vedic Suktas. This is for being absorbed in meditation on Brahman’s auspicious body and surrendering to the Lord to attain the self.

A seeker of the individual self like Suśīla needs to curb his senses, fix his mind on Brahman and meditate on his auspicious form to attain the experience of the self which is similar to Brahman. Thus, the names and the descriptions of the activities correspond to this aim. The Ishvara Gita explicitly recommends the Satarudriyam for one seeking to experience the self due to its’ fruit of restraining the senses.

athāsminnantare 'paśyat tamāyāntaṃ mahāmunim /  
śvetāśvataranāmānaṃ mahāpāśupatottamam // KūrmP_1,13.31 //

Meaning: In the meantime, he saw the great muni named Śvetāśvatara coming. He was the most excellent among the practitioners of the  pāśupata vrata.

Note: “mahāpāśupatottamam” – One who is the best among those practicing the pāśupata vrata described in the Atharvasiras. The term “paśupati” refers to the jIvātma as it is the master of “paśu” or anger, ie, it transcends anger in its’ pure state. This Vrata is related to that attainment of that state of the Jiva, so it is called “pāśupata” – it involves transcending anger.

bhasmasaṃdigdhasavāṅgaṃ kaupīnācchādanānvitam /  
tapasā karṣitātmānaṃ śuklayajñopavītinam // KūrmP_1,13.32 //

Meaning: Śvetāśvatara Rishi had applied ashes all over his limbs and only had a loin-cloth covering his body. He had grown thin by his austerities and was wearing a white yajnopavitam.

Note: The application of ashes all over the body is a special component of the Pashupata vrata and is permitted only in this particular mode of upāsaṇa according to the atharvasiras “yadbhasma nāṅgāni saṃspṛśettasmādbrahma…”

The very fact that the practice of wearing ashes is unusual is the reason why Śvetāśvatara Rishi is specifically mentioned to be wearing them. If this was a Shaiva shāstra, then wearing ashes is not an unusual thing and even Suśīla would have been wearing them, so there is no need to mention it. The specific mention of wearing ashes for Śvetāśvatara rishi shows that Suśīla was not wearing ashes, and nor were any others. We never come across a statement such as “Veda Vyasa was wearing Urdhvapundra” in the Shastra because that mark is commonplace and so not mentioned. The ashes are thus related to a specific type of brahmavidya.

samāpya saṃstavaṃ śaṃbhorānandāstrāvilekṣaṇaḥ /  
vavande śirasā pādau prāñjalirvākyamabravīt // KūrmP_1,13.33 //

Meaning: After concluding his praise of the Lord Narayana whose auspicious form causes happiness (śaṃbhu), his eyes were blurred with tears of joy. He bowed down with his head towards his feet, holding his palms in Anjali Mudra.

Note: The fact that he was crying tears of joy after praising the Lord clearly shows that the names of rudra, girisha etc mentioned earlier are to be interpreted based on etymology for Narayana and are not indicative of parvati pati.

Additionally, the Mahabharata clearly refers to Narayana only as Sambhu, as follows:

iti nārāyaṇaḥ śambhuḥ bhagavān jagatām prabhuḥ

ādiśya vibudhān sarvān ajāyata yodoh kule ( ~ anuśasana parva 149।10)

dhanyo 'smyanugṛhīto 'smi yanme sākṣānmunīśvaraḥ /  
yogīśvaro 'dya bhagavān dṛṣṭo yogavidāṃ varaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.34 //

Meaning: I am grateful and blessed as the Master of those Jnāna-Yogis who meditate on the self (munīśvaraḥ), the Master of those Bhakti-Yogis who meditate on Brahman (yogīśvara), the greatest of those who know the means to attain liberation (yogavidāṃ varaḥ), the respected one who is omniscient (bhagavān) has been directly seen by me.

As mentioned before, “muni” can also mean those who meditate on the meanings of the Veda (apara-vidyā) and “yogi” can mean those who perform upāsaṇa (para-vidyā). The rishi is the superior most of both categories.

  

aho me sumahadbhāgyaṃ tapāṃsi saphalāni me /  
kiṃ kariṣyāmi śiṣyo 'haṃ tava māṃ pālayānagha // KūrmP_1,13.35 //

Meaning: Oh! Fortune, which is Bhagavad Nirhetuka Krupa, is indeed great. My penances have attained fruition (by delivering me to you). What can I do (to serve you)? I am your disciple. Protect me, O sinless one (by imparting knowledge).

so 'nugṛhyātha rājānaṃ suśīlaṃ śīlasaṃyutam /  
śiṣyatve parijagrāha tapasā kṣīṇakalpaṣam // KūrmP_1,13.36 //

Meaning: Śvetāśvatara Rishi blessed the King Suśīla of good morals and gentle behavior. He accepted him as his disciple as his sins (obstructing Jnāna-Yoga) had been destroyed by his penance.

Note: The idea is that Suśīla has become an adhikārin for meditation on the self, since his prior meditation on the Lord had destroyed the sins obstructing his undertaking such meditation.

sāṃnyāsikaṃ vidhiṃ kṛtsnaṃ kārayitvā vicakṣaṇaḥ /  
dadau tadaiśvaraṃ jñānaṃ svaśākhāvihitaṃ vratam // KūrmP_1,13.37 //

Meaning:  The learned sage made him perform all the injunctions pertaining to sannyasa and then bestowed on him the knowledge pertaining to the individual self that is the supreme ruler of the body (aiśvaraṃ jñānaṃ) for which the Vrata (of pāśupata) had been laid down in his own branch of the Veda.

“tad aiśvaraṃ jñānaṃ” – “aiśvaraṃ” refers to the individual self that is the Supreme Ruler of the body, senses and mind. This is the knowledge relating to that self. We will come across this in the Iśvara Gita as well.

“svaśākhāvihitaṃ vratam” – The pāśupata vrata of the Atharvasiras consisting of applying ashes and understanding the knowledge related to paśu  and paśa, to attain the individual self. This again shows that the application of ash etc was only vrata-specific and not indicative of Shaiva practices.

The Atharvasiras recommends bhakti-yoga which is meditation on the antaryāmin of Rudra, using the pāṣupata vrata as an accessory. This was practiced by Rishi Śvetāśvatara. Narayana is called paśupati, as he is the Master of the embodied Jivas who are “paśus” as they are associated with anger. Prakrti or Maya is the “paśa” used to bind them. The knowledge of the paśu and paśa is conferred by the pāśupata vrata, following which one meditates on Pati as the indweller of Rudra according to this upāsana.

However, Suśīla, unlike the rishi, only sought the knowledge of the individual self (Jnāna-Yoga) and not Bhakti-Yoga. So, the rishi taught him the difference between the self and the body (paśu  and paśa) and instructed him on the pāṣupata vrata which inculcates this knowledge. It is to be understood that once Suśīla is doing the meditation as prescribed in the Atharvasiras to attain the self as he was not a Bhakti-Yogi. So, he meditates on the Lord as a means to attain the self, and not as an end in itself.

The next shloka describes what this “aiśvaraṃ jñānaṃ” is in more detail.

aśeṣavedasāraṃ tat paśupāśavimocanam /  
antyāśramamiti khyātaṃ brahmādibhiranuṣṭhitam // KūrmP_1,13.38 //

Meaning: The rishi gave Suśīla the essence of the Veda in entirety (pertaining to the knowledge of the individual self) that causes release of the bound self (paśu) from prakrti or māya which is the rope that binds it (paśa). This knowledge is called “antyāśrama” or the state of the Paramahamsa Sannyasins and has been practiced by the gods beginning with Brahma or the rishis like Pulastya, Pulaha etc.

Note: For those who are tired of material objects and the perishability of their enjoyment, experiencing the imperishable bliss of the individual self is a higher goal that offers relief from the distress of samsāra.

“brahmādi” – This can refer to devas beginning with Brahma. Or, “brahmādi” can refer to the rishis beginning with Pulastya, Pulaha, etc. This is mentioned by Shri Viraraghavacharya in his Bhagavata commentary.

Here it is seen that Suśīla only received Jivatma Jnāna and not Paramatma Jnāna, showing he was a Jnāna-Yogi. Rishi Śvetāśvatara, however, was a Bhakti-Yogi.

uvāca śiṣyān saṃprekṣya ye tadāśramavāsinaḥ /  
brāhmaṇān kṣatriyān vaiśyān brahmacaryaparāyaṇān // KūrmP_1,13.39 //

Meaning: Perceiving all his sishyas residing in the Ashramas, who were brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and brahmacharyas, the rishi Śvetāśvatara said the following.

mayā pravartitāṃ śākhāmadhītyaiveha yoginaḥ /  
samāsate mahādevaṃ dhyāyanto niṣkalaṃ śivam // KūrmP_1,13.40 //

Meaning: It is only after studying the branch of the Veda propagated by me, that the Yogis attain the great self-luminous entity that is the individual self (mahādevaṃ) after meditating on the self which is partless (niṣkalaṃ) and agreeable as it is blissful and divested of prakrti (śivam).

Note: These are not epithets of Parvati Pati. The individual self is the great one that shines out by itself as “I” (deva) and thus, is Mahadeva. It is great as it is superior to prakrti or because it is boundless in attributive knowledge (dharma-bhūta-jnāna). The self is partless or niṣkalaṃ as it is the same everywhere, whether it is in the body of a man, deva, etc. Alternatively, as it is knowledge and bliss everywhere, it can be said to be partless due to lack of organs, etc. It is “śivam” or agreeable on account of being blissful and divested of prakrtic guṇās.

The idea is that, the individual self is meditated as niṣkalaṃ and śivam to attain the experience of its’ intrinsic bliss. This is done using the pāśupata vrata, to attain vairagya as well as discrimination between the self and prakrti.

Another reading of the text replaces “dhyāyanto niṣkalaṃ śivam” with “dhyāyanto visvam aiśvaraṃ”. The meaning does not change. It means “They meditate on the omnipresent self which is the Lordly ruler of the body”.

iha devo mahādevo ramamāṇaḥ sahomayā /  
adhyāste bhagavānīśo bhaktānāmanukampayā // KūrmP_1,13.41 //

Meaning: Here, the God Mahadeva sports with Uma. The omniscient ruler (bhagavānīśa) occupies the place to bless the bhakti-yogis (with knowledge).

Note: Readers should note that here “devo mahādevo” is mentioned to specifically highlight the fact that the God Rudra is being referred to, as opposed to the previous shloka which simply used “mahādevaṃ” to denote the individual self. This should make things clear that “mahādevaṃ” in the previous shloka denoted the self and not Rudra.

This shloka establishes that the grace of Mahadeva is required to gain knowledge of Brahman to attain the individual self. Alternatively, if we interpret “bhakta” as those steadfastly engaged in practicing meditation on the individual self, then it can be said Rudra grants knowledge of the individual self directly.

The next 3 shlokas declare the reason why Rudra is a medium of knowledge for Brahman.

ihāśeṣajagaddhātā purā nārāyaṇaḥ svayam /  
ārādhayanmahādevaṃ lokānāṃ hitakāmyayā // KūrmP_1,13.42 //

Meaning: Previously, Narayana himself, who is the creator of the entire Universe including brahma and others, worshipped Rudra for the benefit of the worlds.

Note: This is the place where the Lord worshipped Rudra for obtaining a son. Here, it is clearly mentioned that the Lord worshipped Rudra for the “sake of the benefit of the worlds”. Meaning, he did not worship Rudra because he was inferior to the latter, but only to make Rudra worshippable in the worlds as clarified by him in the shanti parva of the Mahabharata. Also, note that Bhagavan is hailed as the creator of the Universe.

“āśeṣa” implies he is the creator of all including Brahma and Rudra as well, which brings out his supremacy. Otherwise, there is no need for this word. It is intended to convey every being, including Rudra was created by him.

The consequences of Narayana worshipping Rudra in this manner are described in the next shloka.

ihaiva devamīśānaṃ devānāmapi daivatam /  
ārādhya mahatīṃ siddhiṃ lebhire devadānavāḥ // KūrmP_1,13.43 //

Meaning: It is after worshipping the God īśāna (Rudra), the God of Gods beginning with Indra etc that Devas and Danavas attained great siddhis (anima, garima, etc).

Note: This is a consequence of the Lord worshipping Rudra. As Shri Krishna tells Arjuna in the Shanti Parva, whatever pramāṇa he gives, the world follows. If he did not worship Rudra, others would not worship him, meaning, Rudra, who is his body. As he worshipped Rudra and made him a bestower of boons, the devas and danavas worshipped him to gain powers.

Unlike Narayana who worshipped Rudra for the benefit of the worlds, they worshipped him for petty boons as is evident.

The next shloka clarifies that Rudra can also grant knowledge and not just petty boons.

ihaiva munayaḥ pūrvaṃ marīcyādyā maheśvaram /  
dṛṣṭvā tapobalājjñānaṃ lebhire sārvakālikam // KūrmP_1,13.44 //

Meaning: It was here that formerly, the sages beginning with Marici perceived Maheśvara by their ascetic power and gained knowledge of the everlasting or eternal (self).

Note: “sārvakālikam” refers to the individual self which is eternal. Rudra granted them that knowledge and aided them in their Upasana.

tasmāt tvamapi rājendra tapoyogasamanvitaḥ /  
tiṣṭha nityaṃ mayā sārdhaṃ tataḥ siddhimavāpsyasi // KūrmP_1,13.45 //

Meaning: Therefore, chief among Kings, you too abide here practicing “tapas” which is contemplation of the self as distinct from the body and performing desireless action that is karma yoga. Stay with me permanently and you will attain success in Yoga.

Note: “tapaḥ” means knowledge – tapobrahma. Knowledge in the form of meditation on the self as distinct from the body is tapas. The term “yoga” means skill in action and thus refers to performing activities without desire for their fruits. The rishi is thus instructing Suśīla to perform Karma-Yoga, which is carrying out prescribed duties while meditating on the self as distinct from the body.

Why is the rishi instructing Suśīla to do Karma-Yoga when he was qualified for Jnāna-Yoga? Sri Krishna explains in the Gita that while Karma-Yoga can lead to Jnāna-Yoga, it is possible to skip Jnāna-Yoga and attain the self by Karma-Yoga itself. This is because even Karma-Yoga has the knowledge component as it requires meditation on the self as distinct from the body. It is easier to perform actions as opposed to sitting still in a secluded place and meditating on the self. On account of these, the rishi has advised Suśīla to undertake Karma-Yoga to secure the experience of the self.

Alternatively, this statement can mean the rishi is recommending Jnāna-Yoga as well. We can take “tapaḥ” as referring to Jnāna-Yoga or meditation on the self, whereas “yoga” means desireless action (karma-yoga) which is practiced as its’ ancillary.

evamābhāṣya viprendro devaṃ dhyātvā pinākinam /  
ācacakṣe mahāmantraṃ yathāvat svārthasiddhaye // KūrmP_1,13.46 //

Meaning: After saying thus, the Brahmana meditated on Śiva who is Pināki. He gave the Mahamantra by which one attains his objective.

Note: It should be understood that the Rishi meditated on Rudra due to his status as a medium of the knowledge of Brahman. Alternatively, it can also be said that the meditation is on Narayana who is “Rudra-Śariraka-Paramatma” as described in the Atharvasiras which enjoins such meditation, and the Rishi is a Bhakti-Yogi following this Upasana.

“pinākin” – One who holds the Pinaka bow, or one who possesses “pināka” or the quality of drinking, ie, experiencing (pi) the bliss of the supreme abode which is the individual self.  
  
sarvapāpopaśamanaṃ vedasāraṃ vimuktidam /  
agnirityādikaṃ puṇyamṛṣibhiḥ saṃpravartitam // KūrmP_1,13.47 //

Meaning: That Mantra destroys all sins. It is the essence of the Vedas and confers liberation from the distress of samsara (in the form of experience of the self). It is “agniriti bhasma…”. The auspicious mantra has been propagated by the rishis.

Note: This is an aupachārika shloka glorifying the mantra for application of ashes. The application of ashes on one’s body signifies he has relinquished the body, understanding it to be temporary, and engaging in the pursuit of the self which is eternal.

so 'pi tadvacanād rājā suśīlaḥ śraddhayānvitaḥ /  
sākṣāt pāśupato bhūtvā vedābhyāsarato 'bhavat // KūrmP_1,13.48 //

Meaning: Upon that instruction, the King Suśīla, with unwavering conviction (in attaining the self), verily became “pāśupata” or one who is associated with meditation on the individual self known as “paśupati”, engaged in study of the Veda.

Note: “paśupati” – The individual self that is the master of anger in its’ pure state. “pāśupata” – Practitioner of meditation on this self. Alternatively, it also means he is a practitioner of the pāśupata vrata.

bhasmoddhūlitasarvāṅgaḥ kandamūlaphalāśanaḥ /  
śānto dānto jitakrodhaḥ saṃnyāsavidhimāśritaḥ // KūrmP_1,13.49 //

Meaning: Suśīla resorted to the practice of sannyasa which is meditation on the self by smearing ashes all over his body, subsisting on fruits and roots, being calm, ie, a mind contented in experiencing the self and not having desire for material objects (śānta), subduing the senses (dānta) and conquering anger (jitakrodhaḥ).

Note: “sannyasa” means jnāna-yoga, performed after renouncing action.

All these qualities are cultivated by the Jnāna-Yogi for meditation on the individual self. Note that there are no shaiva elements like “Suśīla attained Kailaśa in the end” or “Suśīla became a devotee of Śiva and Uma”. That itself shows that this meditation is not a Shaiva rite, but is for attaining the individual self.

With this, the section is concluded. It can be seen that the Rishi Śvetāśvatara was no Shaiva, but only a follower of the Vaidika marga, considering Hari alone as Supreme.

A MINOR CLARIFICATION

In the beginning, we mentioned that Rishi Śvetāśvatara was a Hayagrīva bhakta. In that case, how can he be said to perform the Atharvasiras upāsana of Rudra-Śariraka-Paramātma who is Narasimha? The answer is that, the only binding condition is to meditate on the indweller of Rudra in this upāsana. There is no mandate that one must only meditate on the antaryāmin as Narasimha. Though Narasimha is indeed the natural form of Śankarśana, the indweller of Rudra, the Lord assumes whatever form the Yogi desires to see him as. Furthermore, there is no difference in the greatness of one form from the other. On account of this, it is quite permissible to meditate on the antaryāmin of Rudra as Hayagrīva.



#### Prelude to Isvara Gita - Part IV: Kaivalya Upanishad

Having seen jnāna-yoga that is the means to meditate on the self, the meditation of the Atharvasiras in which the Pāśupata-Vrata is enjoined to attain dispassion for material objects and discrimination of the self from the body, and the instance of the practice of such upāsana in the kūrma purāṇa, let us look at a couple of Upanishads which focus solely on these topics.

One such Upanishad is the Kaivalya Upanishad. The term “Kaivalya” itself denotes aloofness from prakrti – it refers to the pure state of the liberated self that has no connection with karmas.



This Upanishad, which has “jīvātma-anubhāva” as its’ primary theme, has been wrongly and unjustly interpreted by modern day shaivAdvaitins as pertaining to Shiva. In this context, we find it appropriate to echo the harsh criticism used by Sri Vadiraja Tirtha in his “Prakashika” on Advaitins to condemn these Shaiva friendly interpretations – “akin to a monkey's handling of a necklace of precious gems (markato svakaragata ratnamalaya iva)”.

Interestingly, one of these Shaiva commentators, Alladi Mahadeva Sastry, feels duty-bound to take every reference to “umāsahāyam” or “Siva” as referring to his preferred deity, but when the term “Vāsudeva” occurs in the Amrtabindu Upanishad, it apparently denotes a general meaning! This is not permitted by the Shastras, for there is no instance where Vāsudeva is used in a manner divorced from Nārāyaṇa /Vishnu, whereas there are several instances of terms like “Siva”, “Umāpati” being used to denote objects and entities other than Rudradeva. In contrast, the names – Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva – have not been used anywhere to denote any entity other than the highest Brahman in the Vedas and have been identified with the God Vishnu according to the Vishnu Gayatri.

When there is no devotion to Narayana, the Supreme Lord, for these authors who consider lesser gods as supreme, how can one understand the correct meanings of Shastras?

With that out of the way, let us begin the translation. The Ishvara Gita can be considered as the essence of the meanings contained in this Upanishad.

oṃ athāśvalāyano bhagavantaṃ parameṣṭhinamupasametyovāca ।

adhīhi bhagavanbrahmavidyāṃ variṣṭhāṃ sadā sadbhiḥ sevyamānāṃ nigūḍhām ।

yathā'cirātsarvapāpaṃ vyapohya parātparaṃ puruṣaṃ yāti vidvān  (1)

Meaning: Ashvalayana approached Parameshthi (Brahma) and asked him – “Teach me that Brahma-Vidya or science of meditation on the individual self, which is the highest goal, in which the sattvikas always dwell (in meditation), hidden (imperceptible by the senses), by which a knower or meditator drives away all sins quickly and obtains the (experience of the) individual self that dwells in the body, which is higher than prakrti that is distinct from it (parātparaṃ puruṣaṃ).

The theme of the Upanishad is “jnana-yoga” or meditation on the individual self. Paramatma is not the subject matter, rather the goal is to realize and experience the intrinsic bliss of the self.

It is called the highest goal as it is more pleasurable than material objects and is the highest object of attainment among all objects under Bhagavan’s control. It is higher than prakrti, which is distinct from it, hence it is called “parātparaṃ”. It is called “puruṣa” as it dwells in the body.

Ashvalayana approached Brahma in the manner of a sishya and asked him the question. “parameṣṭhin” means “parame sthāne tiṣtati” – One who resides in Satya Loka, the highest abode.

tasmai sa hovāca pitāmahaśca śraddhābhaktidhyānayogādavaihi  na karmaṇā na prajayā dhanena tyāgenaike amṛtatvamānaśuḥ (2)

Meaning: Brahma replied, “Know (the self) by conviction, devotion, meditation and performance of works without attachment to the fruits. Not by activities such as sacrifices, not by offspring, not by wealth, but by renunciation (of all these), the great ones attained the state of experience of the imperishable self.

Śraddhā – Steady conviction in the means practiced to attain the self.

bhakti – Devotion to the Supreme Lord Narayana. As Krishna says in the Gita, one needs to meditate on him to attain the similar state of the individual self. The Lord is the means to attain Atma-anubhava as well.

dhyāna – The path of jnana-yoga which involves meditation on the Lord as enshrined in the Pranava, to attain the self. Even for attaining the bliss of the individual self, the Lord alone is the means. The qualities of the individual self are also meditated upon.

yogā– This means “skill of action”. Performing actions skillfully means not claiming ownership of the fruit, with the constant thought that the self is distinct from the body which is performing these activities.

One should renounce fruits of sacrifices (karmas), offspring and wealth as these are material objects. The Gita makes this clear in the first 6 chapters.

“amṛtatvam” – The state of experience of the bliss of the imperishable self.

pareṇa nākaṃ nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ vibhrājate yadyatayo viśanti vedāntavijñānasuniśrcitārthāḥ saṃnyāsayogādyatayaḥ śuddhasattvāḥ (3)

Meaning: That supreme abode (the individual self) which is beyond prakrti (pareṇa nākaṃ), abiding in the cave of the heart (nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ), shining out (by itself), ie, self-luminous (vibhrājate) – That is entered by those with controlled minds, who have ascertained the goal by the knowledge of the Upanishads (vedāntavijñānasuniśrcitārthāḥ), whose minds have been purified by sannyasa yoga.

“sannyasa yoga” means jnāna-yoga. Renouncing action, meditating on the individual self to obtain its’ vision. The Yogi, having been purified by desireless action (karma yoga), proceeds to this stage where he devotes himself to the meditation on the individual self.

The minds of the aspirants are purified of desire for material objects by constant contemplation on the self.

te brahmalokeṣu parāntakāle parāmṛtāḥ parimucyanti sarve (4)

Meaning:  They (the Jīvās), located in the hearts of all beings (brahmalokeShu), during the time of destruction of the body, ie, death (parāntakāle), all become liberated from the nectar (experience) of material objects (parāmṛtāḥ parimucyanti sarve).

“brahmaloka” refers to the heart.

“parāmṛtāḥ” – The different kinds of nectar or food (āmṛtāḥ) which signifies experience of material objects that are other than (parāḥ) the individual self, ie, of a different (perishable) nature.

This mantra also proves the plurality of Jīvās by saying “they”. Where it is mentioned in singular, it is only because they belong to a single class of identical Jīvās and not because there is only one entity that exists.

viviktadeśe ca sukhāsanasthaḥ śuciḥ samagrīvaśiraḥśarīraḥ ।

antyāśramasthaḥ sakalendriyāṇi nirudhya bhaktyā svaguruṃ praṇamya (5)

Meaning:  In a secluded spot (free from people including relatives, preceptors, disciples, etc), seated in a comfortable posture (to facilitate continued meditation), pure (free of insects etc), with an erect neck, head and body, situated in the state of Paramahamsa Sannyasin (antyāśrama), restraining all the senses, with attachment (to the pursuit of the self as an object of attainment), bowing down to one’s preceptor.

These are all to be followed for Jnāna-Yoga and have been described in the Gita.

hṛtpuṇḍarīkaṃ virajaṃ viśuddhaṃ vicintya madhye viśadaṃ viśokam

acintyamavyaktamanantarūpaṃ śivaṃ praśāntamamṛtaṃ brahmayonim (6)

Meaning: In the heart-lotus, devoid of desire (virajaṃ), pure (viśuddhaṃ), who is contemplated upon in the midst of the vaiSvAnara agni (vicintya madhye), shining like a streak of lightening (viśadaṃ), devoid of sorrow (viśokam), who is incomparable (acintyam),  who is unmanifest to the ignorant (avyaktam), who assumes innumerable forms by his will depending on the occasion (anantarūpaṃ), who is agreeable (śivaṃ), who exists solely for his devotees (praśāntam), who is nectarine (amṛtaṃ) and the Cause of the collection of sentients and non-sentients (brahmayonim).

The Lord is to be meditated upon to attain the individual self. This is mentioned in the ākśaropāsaṇa of the Gita. The idea is that, by meditating on the Lord, one obtains the individual self that is divested of prakrti which is similar to the Lord (in being pure, all-pervasive in knowledge and beyond the sway of karma when divested of prakrti).

“brahmayonim” – tasmād etat  brahma nāmarūpaṃ annaṃ ca jāyate (~ mundakOpanishad) –  it refers to the collection of sentients and non-sentients according to shrI ranga rAmAnuja muni.

“praśāntam” – śāntaḥ - teṣām asti iti śāntaḥ – he exists only for his devotees.

“viśadaṃ” – “nIlatoyadamadyasta” as in nārāyaṇa sūkta.

tathādimadhyāntavihīnamekaṃ vibhuṃ cidānandamarūpamadbhutam

umāsahāyaṃ parameśvaraṃ prabhuṃ trilocanaṃ nīlakaṇṭhaṃ praśāntam

dhyātvā munirgacchati bhūtayoniṃ samastasākśiṃ tamasaḥ parastāt (7)

Meaning: Therefore (tathā), meditating on the (aforementioned) Being who is devoid of a beginning, middle and end, who is all-pervading as the protector (vibhuM), who is of the nature of consciousness and bliss (cidānandam), who has a wonderful non-material form of half-man, half lion (arūpam adbhutam), who is always accompanied by shrI mahalakShmi who is his fame (umāsahāyaṃ), the Lord of all (parameśvaraṃ), One who has the power to attract the minds of all towards him by his beauty (prabhuṃ), the three-eyed (trilocanaṃ), the black throated (nīlakaṇṭhaṃ), One who makes the devotee enjoy him alone to the exclusion of all (praśāntam), the wise men reach that (individual self) which is the source of all beings (bhūtayoniṃ), that is the witness residing in all bodies (samastasākśiṃ), that is beyond prakrti (tamasaḥ parastāt).

“bhūtayoniṃ” – “bhUta” refers to embodied beings like man, deva etc. As these are all conditions of the individual self which is the effect, it is called the source or cause of these beings.

“samastasākśiṃ” – The individual self is the witness dwelling in these bodies.

Note that when we say “self”, we mean innumerable selves identical in nature. For eg: “rice” refers to several grains of rice which are identical.

Alternatively, it can also mean the Supreme Abode of Sri Vaikuntha. “bhūtayoniṃ” – "Yoni" means abode. "bhUta" refers to all muktas who have reached the abode. “samastasākśiṃ” – Perceived by all nitya-sUrIs (sadā paṣyanti sūraya:). There is no contradiction, since Jnana-Yogis could progress to Bhakti-Yoga and attain the Lord. Alternatively, while describing the Lord as the means, Paramapada is naturally mentioned.

sa brahmā sa śivaḥ sendraḥ so'kṣaraḥ paramaḥ svarāṭ । sa eva viṣṇuḥ sa prāṇaḥ sa kālo'gniḥ sa candramāḥ  (8)

Meaning: He is Brahma, He is Siva, He is Indra, He is the liberated Jiva (akshara), He is the celebrated Master of Karma. He alone is Vishnu, He is the Vital Breath, He is Time, He is Agni, He is the Moon.

The Upanishad is now teaching that the Lord is sarvāntarātma and everything is his vibhūti on account of being his body. Vishnu is verily the avatāra of Brahman while the rest have Brahman as their innerselves. This teaching is for the Jnāna-Yogi to meditate on the Lord as ensouling everything, including himself, to attain the similar state of the individual self which is the indweller of all the bodies.

Shaiva commentators like Alladi Mahadeva Sastry have rambled on here about how Uma (Parvati) is the cause of Brahma, Vishnu, etc according to this mantra. Such avaidika opinions are errant nonsense and have no place or context in this Upanishad.

sa eva sarvaṃ yadbhūtaṃ yacca bhavyaṃ sanātanam । jñātvā taṃ mṛtyumatyeti nānyaḥ panthā vimuktaye  (9)

Meaning: He alone is all, what has been, (what is) and what is yet to be, the eternal. Knowing him, one surpasses the distress of samsara. There is no other path to liberation (from the distress of samsara).

When it is said he is all that has been and will be, it is also meant that he is all that is presently existing as well. This is on account of his sarvāntaryāmitva, and by having all the entities as his body, he is said to be all using sāmānādhikaraṇya.

The mantra states that the Lord is the sarvāntaryāmin. This is to enable the Yogi seeking the experience of the individual self to realize the similarity between himself and the Lord – by meditating on the Lord who is sarvāntaryāmin, the Yogi attains the self which is also sarvāntaryāmin (abiding in all bodies).

In the experience of the individual self which is attained by such contemplation on the Lord, there is no distress arising from samsAra such as old age, hunger, thirst, etc.

sarvabhūtasthamātmānaṃ sarvabhūtāni cātmani । sampaśyanbrahma paramaṃ yāti nānyena hetunā (10)

Meaning: Seeing the Self abiding in all beings, and seeing all beings in the Self, one attains the individual self that is the highest object of enjoyment.

The previous mantra emphasized on realizing the similarity of the Lord and the individual self. This mantra now emphasizes that the Yogi must realize the similarity of himself with other selves.

Since the individual selves are all identical in nature, the Yogi meditating on the self sees himself in other bodies of man, deva, etc. He does not see them as different from himself. This is not Shankaracharya’s kevala advaita, but a realization of “Advaita” or “sameness/oneness” – he sees everyone equally and the same everywhere. Being identical to others in their essential nature, he sees himself everywhere and considers the pain and pleasures of others as his own. This is the summit of Jnana-Yoga as described by the Gita.

“brahma paramaṃ” – The pure state of the individual self which is great on account of all-pervasive knowledge and is the highest of all the objects of enjoyment that are under the dominion of the Lord.

Besides understanding the self in this manner, one should also meditate on the Lord as the means to attain the self and so that is described below.

ātmānamaraṇiṃ kṛtvā praṇavaṃ cottarāraṇim । jñānanirmathanābhyāsātpāpaṃ dahati paṇḍitaḥ (11)

Meaning: Having made the Self the lower arani and Pranava the upper arani, by the practice of the churning of the form of knowledge (ie, meditation), the wise person burns up all sins (obstructing the vision of the self).

A similar mantra exists in the Svetāśvatāra Upanishad. In order to attain the individual self, one should meditate on the Lord through praṇavopāsaṇa. This enables attainment of the self which is similar to the Lord.

The way of perceiving the hidden Lord dwelling within the Jiva through the means of Praṇava is described here. “Atman” in the mantra refers to the Jivatma. The Supreme Atman, who is the indweller of this Jiva, is meditated with the Praṇava. The churning with the Praṇava implies practice of that which is ordained and abstention from those that are prohibited, and practicing the virtues of satya and tapaḥ.

When such meditation is carried out, the Supreme Self indwelling within the Jivatma, is revealed like fire from the aranis, and this destroys sins obstructing the experience of the individual self.

Not only should one meditate on the self as being ensouled by the Lord, but one should also understand the nature of the body to attain dispassion from it. So, the state of the embodied self in the waking and dreaming states is described in the next mantra.

sa eva māyāparimohitātmā śarīramāsthāya karoti sarvam । stryannapānādivicitrabhogaiḥ sa eva jāgratparitṛptimeti (12)

Meaning: He (the individual self) is alone deluded in mind by Prakrti known as Maya, situated in the body, doing all activities (ie, considering himself the doer). He alone, while awake, gains satisfaction in women, food, drink, svarga and other varied types of sense-gratification.

“karoti sarvam” means he considers himself the doer, when actually, doership is on account of the triguṇās caused by prakrti.

svapne sa jīvaḥ sukhaduḥkhabhoktā svamāyayā kalpitajīvaloke । suṣuptikāle sakale vilīne tamo'bhibhūtaḥ sukharūpameti  (13)

Meaing: The Jivatma, in dream state, is the enjoyer of pleasure and pain in the dream body assumed by his own will. During Sushupti (dreamless sleep), when everything has disappeared, overwhelmed by darkness, he exists in the form of bliss (ie, he experiences the bliss of Paramatman).

“kalpita jīvaloke” – Having assumed a dream body. “loka” means “abode” as in “body” here. “jIvayati iti jIva” – that body which gives life to the jIva in its’ dream state, as it enables the jIva to experience pain and pleasure. The dream objects are created by Ishvara for the jIva to experience based on its’ puNya and pApa.

“svamāyayā” – His own will. “māyā” means knowledge and thus it is knowledge which is the basis of will. It means that he makes his actual body and senses non-functional and takes up the dream body.

suṣuptikāle sakale vilīne – When a person is in the form of sushupti, he is without the relationship of karma that results in association with body and others and at that time, he is an asharīra. So, everything such as father, mother etc as well as the worlds, vedas etc have disappeared, for he is not bound by their dictates. The sushupta is not having any Ashraya in them, hence, they are said to have disappeared.

tamo'bhibhūtaḥ \- Overwhelmed by darkness, meaning, he does not see a second object as he is cut off from the senses. The sushupta doesn’t see the objects outside and the sense-organs inside. Though he is having the ability to see, he does not see. How can that be so? It is explained below.

During sushupti, the dharma-bhūta-jnāna (attributive knowledge that is used to cognize external objects) is not lost. Rather, the attributive knowledge remains, but there is no second object to be cognized. This is because in this state, he has overpowered his karmas. It is karmas that cause experience of objects. The dharma-bhūta-jnāna is cut off from the sense-organs which are its’ gateways and thus the Jiva does not see anything else.

If it is asked how a Jiva in sushupti can overcome karmas without liberation which alone grants that state, it is answered that during the state of sushupti, the karmas that exist are not tending to yield any results in that state, and so he is said to have crossed them.

In this state of sushupti, the relationship with karmas is absent and so the relationship with the senses is absent. Hence, there is absence of cognition of a second object other than Paramatman. As no object other than Paramatman can be cognized, he abides in the Paramatman who is the supreme bliss, the support of sushupti.

punaśca janmāntarakarmayogātsa eva jīvaḥ svapiti prabuddhaḥ । puratraye krīḍati yaśca jīvastatastu jātaṃ sakalaṃ vicitram । ādhāramānandamakhaṇḍabodhaṃ yasmim̐llayaṃ yāti puratrayaṃ ca (14)

Meaning: Again (repeatedly), by virtue of connection with karmas from prior births, the same jIva dreams or is awake. From the Jiva, who sports in the 3 abodes (jāgrat, svapna and sushupti sthAnas), is born all the diverse entities like man, deva etc. He is the support, of the nature of bliss, who makes everything known by his dharma-bhūta-jnāna and in him alone, the three worlds (puratrayaM) dissolve.

“karma yoga” –  Association with karmas.

The various forms such as man, deva etc are but effects of the Self which is the cause and so the Universe is said to be born from him.

“Anandam” means he is of the nature of bliss as well as knowledge, since bliss implies knowledge. “akhaṇḍabodhaṃ” signifies he perceives everything by his dharma-bhUta-jnAna.

In him, the entire Universe consisting of the three worlds dissolve, meaning, the subtle state of the Universe is a condition of the Jiva when he is the Cause, and is dependent on him.

etasmājjāyate prāṇo manaḥ sarvendriyāṇi ca । khaṃ vāyurjyotirāpaśca pṛthvī viśvasya dhāriṇī (15)

Meaning: From the Jiva are born the vital breath, mind and all the senses, the ether, air, fire, water and Earth which support all objects of enjoyment.

As the Cause, the Jiva has the unmanifest prakrti as its form. From this Cause, the Jiva which has as its’ form the gross prakrti differentiated into prANa, manas, the panchabhUtAs, etc  is manifested. Thus, everything is born from the Jiva.

“viśvasya dhāriṇī” – The term “vishva” refers to all objects of enjoyment experienced by the Jiva.

yatparaṃ brahma sarvātmā viśvasyāyatanaṃ mahat । sūkṣmātsūkṣmataraṃ nityaṃ tattvameva tvameva tat  (16)

Meaning: That which is the individual self, higher than prakrti, is the self of all, the great abode of all beings in the Universe, subtler than the subtle, eternal as it is unchanging in its’ essential nature, that is you alone, you are that.

Note that the self is referred to as singular in the same way as grains of rice are called “rice”. As all selves are identical, it is said to be everywhere dwelling in all bodies in the singular (sarvātmā). It supports all forms of man, deva etc (viśvasyāyatanaṃ). It is all-pervasive in its’ pure state, and is other from prakrti (paraṃ brahma).

The last line is repeated for emphasis, to dispel dehātma bhrama and make clear that one is the self, distinct from the body – “realize you are that self with those characteristics, distinct from the insentient body”.

The Shaiva commentators assume this to be talking about paramātma and think that “tat tvam eva” is a reference to the Chandogya Upanishad’s “tat tvam asi”. This is incorrect, as this particular mantra has no relevance to that Chandogya statement, nor is it talking about paramātma.

jāgratsvapnasuṣuptyādiprapañcaṃ yatprakāśate । tadbrahmāhamiti jñātvā sarvabandhaiḥ pramucyate (17)

Meaning:  That Jiva which illumines the perceptible world composed of the states of waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep and so on by its’ dharma-bhUta-jnAna, knowing that individual self (tadbrahmā) as “I” (distinct from the body), one is liberated from all fetters.

“jāgratsvapnasuṣuptyādi” – The “Adi” at the end signifies that not only are these states belonging to samsAra illumined, but also the illumination of the Supreme Abode upon liberation (turīya sthāna) is by the dharma-bhūta-jnāna, which is carried into liberation.

The next few mantras enjoin how to meditate on the self.

triṣu dhāmasu yadbhogyaṃ bhoktā bhogaśca yadbhavet । tebhyo vilakṣaṇaḥ sākṣī cinmātro'haṃ sadāśivaḥ (18)

Meaning:  Whatever, in the three abodes of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep, becomes the object of enjoyment, the enjoyer and the act (instrument) of enjoyment, from them, I am distinct, the witness (as the indweller of all bodies), of the nature of knowledge, eternally auspicious.

The individual self is distinct from the objects of enjoyment and the instrument or act of enjoyment such as the sense-organs or the dream body which are made of prakrti. Since its’ essential nature is different from such enjoyment, it is also said to be distinct from the state of being the enjoyer of such objects.

“sadāśivaḥ” – “sadā niravadya” – the self is devoid of the triguṇās and hence is eternally pure.

It is hilarious how biased Shaiva commentators like Alladi Mahadeva Sastry pounce on such adjectives to interpret them as referring to Rudra when such a meaning is non-existent in the present context.

mayyeva sakalaṃ jātaṃ mayi sarvaṃ pratiṣṭhitam । mayi sarvaṃ layaṃ yāti tadbrahmādvayamasmyaham (19)

Meaning: In me all these forms of man, deva etc are born. In me is all this established. In me does all this undergo dissolution. I am that individual self which is all-pervasive in its’ knowledge in the pure state (tadbrahmā), the one without a second, as there is no entity like me.

The various forms such as man, deva etc arise in accordance with the karmas of the selves and so are said to be born from the self. The presence of the self which dwells in all bodies and experiences material objects sustains these bodies. These bodies are also dissolved in the Self, as their destruction occurs when the Self leaves these bodies (hence, their destruction is dependent on the Self).

“advaya” – The self, which is essentially of identical nature in all beings, is incomparable to objects other than it, being unique. This is mentioned in Gita 2.29


aṇoraṇīyānahameva tadvanmahānahaṃ viśvamahaṃ vicitram । purātano'haṃ puruṣo'hamīśo hiraṇmayo'haṃ śivarūpamasmi (20)

Meaning: I am verily subtler than the subtle, I am the great controller of the mind, body and senses, I am “Vishvam” as  I enter into all the worlds (viśvamahaṃ), I am incomparable (vicitram.h), I am ancient being prior to the body (purātano'haṃ), I am “Purusha”, the indweller of the body (puruṣo'ham), I am the ruler of the mind, senses and body, of the form of gold (īśo hiraṇmayo'haṃ), I am of an agreeable nature (śivarūpamasmi).

“hiraṇmayo'haṃ” – “gold” signifies objects of desire. The self is of the nature of bliss and hence a desirable object of attainment.

“śivarūpam” – the self is of the nature of bliss and knowledge, untainted by prakrti and hence is agreeable.

apāṇipādo'hamacintyaśaktiḥ paśyāmyacakṣuḥ sa śṛṇomyakarṇaḥ । ahaṃ vijānāmi viviktarūpo na cāsti vettā mama citsadā'ham (21)

Meaning: Even without legs and hands, I possess incomparable capability (to do those tasks), without eyes I see, without ears, I hear. I know, ie, I perceive all this by my dharma-bhūta-jnāna (ahaṃ vijānāmi), I am of a form free from blemishes of the triguṇās in the liberated state (viviktarūpa). I am not known to anyone. I am of the nature of consciousness.

The jIva can do the tasks of legs, hands, eyes and ears without the actual organs because of its’ all-pervasive dharma-bhūta-jnāna in its’ pure state. It is its’ natural condition. This is as per Gita 13.14 again.

“na cāsti vettā mama” – As the Gita 2.29 says,  the jIva is inconceivable to many and wonderful. Some speak of it to another, some hear about it, and even after hearing about it, no-one knows it exactly as it exists.

vedairanekairahameva vedyo vedāntakṛdvedavideva cāham । na puṇyapāpe mama nāsti nāśo na janma dehendriyabuddhirasti (22)

Meaning: I alone am to be known by the knowledge of various beings like man, deva etc. I am the creator of karmas which are the cause of obtaining such bodies (vedāntakṛd) and I am the experiencer of the pain and pleasure that constitute the acquisition of such bodies (vedavid). Punya and Papa are not mine, ie, they do not belong to my essential nature.  I am not subject to birth or death and I do not exist in the body, senses and the mind associated with determining power (ie, I am not dependent on them for my existence).

The śaivādvaitin commentators like Alladi Mahadeva Sastry and Shankarananda have foolishly interpreted “vedāntakṛd” as “maker/author of the Upanishads” – this is impossible as shruti is apāuruśeya. They try to interpret “kṛd” as “Maker” in the sense of “Revealer”, but that is stretching the meaning, for in that case, there is no need to specifically say “he knows the Veda” and “he revealed the Vedānta” when even the Vedas were revealed by him.

“vedairanekairahameva vedyo” – “vedair” refers to several kinds of knowledge of diverse beings such as man, deva etc which are signified by “anekair”. Since the self is identical in all beings, it alone is known by these forms which are its’ effects.

“vedāntakṛt” – Here, “veda” means acquisition or obtaining. “anta” means cause and “krt” means creating or making. The Jiva, by virtue of its’ actions, is the creator of its’ karmas which are the cause of obtaining bodies of man, deva, etc.

“vedavid” – Here, “veda” again refers to acquisition or the fruits that are attained by such actions. “vid” refers to knowing in the form of experiencing. The sentient Jiva and not the insentient body is the experiencer.

"buddhi" is the power of the mind to determine and thus denotes the mind in this context as it is closely associated with that power (aprthak-siddhi).

na bhūmirāpo na ca vahnirasti na cānilo me'sti na cāmbaraṃ ca । evaṃ viditvā paramātmarūpaṃ guhāśayaṃ niṣkalamadvitīyam samastasākṣiṃ sadasadvihīnaṃ prayāti śuddhaṃ paramātmarūpam ॥ (23)

Meaning: Neither the Earth, nor the Waters, nor Fire, nor the Wind, nor the Ether are not me, ie, my nature is different to them. Thus knowing (meditating on) the Jivatma which is of the condition of the Supreme Self in relation to the body, mind and senses (paramātmarūpaṃ), abiding in the cave of the heart, without diversity (niṣkalam), which is one without a second, ie, it is incomparable (advitīyam), the witness of all as it is the indweller of all bodies (samastasākṣiṃ), which is neither Sat nor Asat(sadasadvihīnaṃ), one attains the (experience of) pure condition of the  individual self that is superior to prakrti.

“paramātmarūpaṃ” – This doesn’t refer to the Lord. The entities such as body, mind and senses can be referred to as “Atma”. Since the individual self associated with the body is higher than all these, it is called “Paramatma”. “rūpaṃ” means form or condition of being in that state, which is the result of attachment to the Gunas arising from the beginningless conjunction with Prakrti.This is explained by Acharya under Gita 13.23.

“niṣkalam” \- As it is identical in nature everywhere, there is no diversity. Alternatively, as it is knowledge-bliss everywhere, it has no parts and cannot be divided into organs, etc.

“sadasadvihīnaṃ” \- “sat” refers to the condition of effects when the individual self has the form of gods, men, etc. “asat” refers to the condition of cause in the form of not possessing names and forms. The self is not a cause or effect by nature and is thus said to be devoid of both. It becomes a cause or effect on account ofavidya brought on by karmas, which cause association withprakrti. This is explained by bhagavad bhAshyakArar in gita 13.13.

yaḥ śatarūdriyamadhīte so'gnipūto bhavati surāpānātpūto bhavati sa brahmahatyāyāḥ pūto bhavati sa suvarṇasteyātpūto bhavati sa kṛtyākṛtyātpūto bhavati tasmādavimuktamāśrito bhavatyatyāśramī sarvadā sakṛdvā japet  anena jñānamāpnoti saṃsārārṇavanāśanam । tasmādevaṃ viditvainaṃ kaivalyaṃ padamaśnute kaivalyaṃ padamaśnuta iti (24)

Meaning:  He who reflects on (the meaning of) the Shatarudriya, he becomes purified in the mind (so'gnipūto bhavati). He has become purified from the sin of drinking liquor, he has become purified from the sin of brahmahatya, he has become purified from the sin of stealing gold, he has become purified from the sin caused by performance of all activities prohibited by the Veda and the non-performance of activities prescribed by the Veda. He finds refuge in the individual self that is undiminishing in its’ pure state (avimukta). He who is a Paramahamsa Sannyasin (atyāśramī), should always recite it, or atleast once. By this he obtains knowledge of the individual self which destroys the ocean of samsara. Therefore, knowing the self in this manner, he attains the state of experiencing the self divested of prakrti (kaivalyaṃ padam). He (indeed) attains the state of experiencing the self divested of prakrti (kaivalyaṃ padam).

Again, we find the persistent motif of the ṣatarudrīyam in association with meditation on the individual self.

The primary fruit of the ṣatarudrīyam is to curb the mind and senses. As Arjuna asks Krishna in the Gita, it is very difficult to meditate on the Jiva (akshara) as the mind is fickle. So Bhagavan tells him that the way to curb the mind and senses is to meditate on his (bhagavan’s) auspicious body, which will destroy the desire for material objects.

Thus, meditating on the Lord in the manner as praised in the ṣatarudrīyam gives the fruit of indrīya-nigraha or curbing the senses. Therefore, recitation of this portion of the Veda is an anga (accessory) for Jnāna-Yoga or meditation on the self, which requires a steady mind and restrained senses. The reference to this recitation destroying various sins is to highlight the fact that it destroys desire for sense-gratification which causes performance of such sinful actions.

Wherever the ṣatarudrīyam is praised in the śāstra as giving moksha, it is implied that it provides the fruit of indrIya-nigraha, which leads to jīvātma-anubhava and thus kaivalya mukti. This, by itself, proves that the tāmasa purāṇās are wrong in recommending the ṣatarudrīyam as a means to propitiate Shiva.

”avimukta” – The liberated self, which is not deprived of its’ completeness, ie, it is all-pervasive in knowledge and replete with the 8 qualities beginning with apahatapApma in its’ pure state.

kaivalyaṃ padam – The state of experiencing the self which is divested from prakrti. “kaivalyaṃ” refers to the self that is aloof from prakrti in its’ pure state.

And thus, the Upanishad is concluded.

  

#### Prelude to Ishvara Gita - Part V: Jabala Upanishad

The final prelude is the Jabala Upanishad, which is another Upanishad that focuses mainly on Jivātma-Upāsaṇa. The purpose of these five preludes is to enable the readers to be acquainted with Jnāna-Yoga, which makes the understanding of the Ishvara Gita easier.  

A word about this Upanishad. We have not commented on it fully. Because the second half of the Upanishad describing the state of sannyAsis is of disputed authenticity – we are not sure as to whether the present version of the Upanishad is authentic in entirety. In shata dUShaNI, Shri Vedanta Desikan does seem to hint that some shrutis have been interpolated and tampered with, in matters related to sannyAsa Ashrama.

In addition, even if this Upanishad was authentic in its entirety, the aspects of sannyasa such as ekadandin vs tridandin, wearing the sacred thread vs not wearing it --- which are the subjects of debate between advaitins and vishishtadvaitins --  is beyond the scope of this blog. It is not necessary to our agenda here and so we are not going to bother with it. Leave it to the pūrvācāryās to resolve such matters in works like Yati-Dharma-Samucchaya and Sata-Dhushani.

So, let us begin.

oṃ bṛhaspatiruvāca yājñavalkyaṃ yadanu kurukṣetraṃ devānāṃ devayajanaṃ sarveṣāṃ bhūtānāṃ brahmasadanam ।

Meaning: Brihaspati asked Yajnavalkya, “Which according to you, is the (nature of the) body that is the abode of the senses (kurukṣetraṃ), where the senses (devānāṃ) perform actions of the self (devayajanaṃ) , which is the seat of the individual self (Brahman) in all beings?”

“kurukṣetra” – The body is called “kshetra” in the Gita. Thus, “kurukṣetra” means “the abode of cruel people”, ie, “the body that houses the senses that trouble us”.

“devānāṃ devayajanaṃ” – “devānāṃ” refers to the senses which shine out external objects to the self. “devayajanaṃ” refers to actions of the self which shines out and hence is called “deva”.

“brahma” – The individual self is called this on account of it being great with all pervasive knowledge. It is identical in nature everywhere, residing in bodies of man, deva, etc.

The question posed by Brihaspati is this – “Explain to me the nature of the body in which the self abides, so that I may attain the knowledge of discrimination between the body and the self”.

avimuktaṃ vai kurukṣetraṃ devānāṃ devayajanaṃ sarveṣāṃ bhūtānāṃ brahmasadanam । tasmādyatra kvacana gacchati tadeva manyeta tadavimuktameva । idaṃ vai kurukṣetraṃ devānāṃ devayajanaṃ sarveṣāṃ bhūtānāṃ brahmasadanam ॥atra hi jantoḥ prāṇeṣūtkramamāṇeṣu rudrastārakaṃ brahma vyācaṣṭe yenāsāvamṛtī bhūtvā mokṣī bhavati tasmādavimuktameva niṣeveta avimuktaṃ na vimuñcedevamevaitadyājñavalkyaḥ ॥ 1॥

Meaning: (Yajnavalkya replied:) “That individual self which is undiminished in its’ pure state (avimukta) is (inseparably associated with) the body, where the senses (devAnA.n) perform actions of the self (devayajanaṃ), which is the seat of the individual self (Brahman) in all beings.

On that account, whichever body one attains (kvacana gacchati), one shall regard that itself as the self (avimukta).

This is the (nature of the) body that is the abode of the senses (kurukṣetra), where the senses (devānāṃ) perform actions of the self (devayajanaṃ), which is the seat of the individual self (Brahman) in all beings.

There (in that knowledge), indeed, when the vital airs depart the living being at the time of death, Rudra imparts the (knowledge of) praṇava (tārakaṃ brahma), by which one becoming (united with) the imperishable self, attains freedom from the distress of samsAra such as old age, hunger, thirst etc.

On account of this, one shall pursue or abide in (the meditation of) the self (avimukta), one shall not leave (the meditation of) the self (avimukta).

(Brihaspati said:) “It is even so as you have said, revered Yajnavalkya.”

“avimukta” refers to the individual self. The phrase “avimuktaṃ vai kurukṣetraṃ” – “The self is verily the body” is not a statement of identity. It means, the self is inseparably associated with the body in samsAra and thus, by aprthak-siddhi, it is called the body.

On account of such inseparable association, beings become deluded by dehātma bhrama in whatever body they go to in every birth, thinking “the self is verily the body itself” each time. So if they are born as man, they identify themselves as man, if they are born as a deva, they identify themselves as deva – in this manner, they are deluded, not knowing that the self is distinct from the characteristics of man, deva etc (tasmādyatra kvacana gacchati tadeva manyeta tadavimuktameva).

Such is the nature of the body which causes delusion or dehātma bhrama. In this manner, to such a one who is situated in that knowledge of the distinction between the body and the self, Rudra imparts the knowledge of the praṇava. This is on account of the fact that Rudra is the bestower of knowledge, according to the following pramāṇās:

- puruṣasya vidmahe sahasrākṣasya mahādevasya dhīmahi । tanno rudraḥ pracodayāt - To know that Purusha Narayana, I meditate on that omniscient Mahadeva. May that Rudra invigorate or impel us.
    

  

- “Omityevam sadā viprāh padatvam dhyāta keśavam” – O Brahmanas! Always keep chanting “OM”. Meditate on Keshava” – These are the words of Shiva himself in the Mahabharata.
    

The praṇava is the knowledge of the Lord, who is meditated upon to attain the similar state of the individual self.

As it causes relief from the distress of samsAra, yajnavAlkya emphasizes that one must never leave the meditation of the self.

atha hainamatriḥ papraccha yājñavalkyaṃ ya eṣo'nanto'vyakta ātmā taṃ kathamahaṃ vijānīyāmiti ॥

Meaning: Thereafter, Atri, asked Yajnavalkya, “How am I to know (meditate on) this Self which is distinct from the perishable body (ananta), beyond the range of the senses (avyakta)?

The body is called “anta” because it is subject the death. The self is “ananta” as it is distinct from it.

The question of Atri is explained thus  – “does the embodied self undergo any changes in its’ essential nature due to such association with the body? How am I to meditate on it?” To that Yajnavalkya answers:

sa hovāca yājñavalkyaḥ so'vimukta upāsyo ya eṣo'nanto'vyakta ātmā so'vimukte pratiṣṭhita iti ॥

Meaning: To this, Yajnavalkya replied: “That self which is undiminished in its’ pure state (avimukta) is meditated, (as) that which is this (embodied self) distinct from the perishable body (ananta), beyond the range of the senses (avyakta). That (embodied condition) is established in the pure self (avimukta).

The various embodied forms such as man, deva etc are but effects of the Self which is the cause. So, the condition of being embodied is said to be established in the pure self. The teaching is that, the self which is embodied does not undergo any changes in its’ essential nature and is identical to the self in the pure state devoid of karmas.

In the next mantra, Yajnavalkya explains how to fix oneself in meditation on the self.

so'vimuktaḥ kasminpratiṣṭhita iti । varaṇāyāṃ nāśyāṃ ca madhye pratiṣṭhita iti ॥ kā vai varaṇā kā ca nāśīti ।

Meaning: What is that in which the self (avimukta) is established in? It is established in between “varaṇā” and “nāśi”. What is varaṇā and What is nāśi?

The self is established – meaning, the knowledge of meditation on the self is attained by the description below.

sarvānindriyakṛtāndoṣānvārayatīti tena varaṇā bhavati ॥ sarvānindriyakṛtānpāpānnāśayatīti tena nāśī bhavatīti ॥

Meaning: Those (actions constituting karma yoga) which checks the sense-enjoyments that constitute the defects gained (by the actions of) the senses are called varaṇā. That (Jnāna-Yoga) which destroys the sins of (all the actions) performed by the senses is called nāśi.

“doṣās” refer to desire for the fruits of actions caused by the wayward senses. Karma Yoga or desireless action with the knowledge that the body is distinct from the self, checks or prevents this desire.

Karma Yoga leads to Jnāna-Yoga which is meditation on the self. Such meditation destroys all sins acquired by past actions, which were obstructing a vision of the self.

katamaṃ cāsya sthānaṃ bhavatīti । bhruvorghrāṇasya ca yaḥ sandhiḥ sa eṣa dyaurlokasya parasya ca sandhirbhavatīti । etadvai sandhiṃ sandhyāṃ brahmavida upāsata iti । so'vimukta upāsya iti। so'vimuktaṃ jñānamācaṣṭe । yo vaitadevaṃ vedeti ॥ 2॥

Meaning: Which is also the place of that (contemplation known as Jnāna-Yoga)?  It is said to be that which is the boundary (tip) of the nose. That (spot) is the co-existence of the eye which shines out external objects (dyaurloka) and that which is other to it, ie, not seeing that (para). The knowers of the self meditate on this co-existence (of fixing the gaze and not seeing it) as the meditation on the self. That self (avimukta) is to be meditated (in this manner).  He who knows (this meditation) in this manner, declares the knowledge pertaining to the self (avimukta) to others (ie, he becomes a teacher well-versed in jivātma-jnāna).

Gita 6.14 says that the Jnāna Yogi desiring to meditate on the self needs to fix his gaze on the tip of the nose to refrain from seeing other objects. While this can be done by closing one’s eyes, this is not recommended as one may fall asleep in that state.

At the same time, it is important that only gaze is fixed there; his mind is engaged in meditation of the self. So, though he is gazing at that spot, he is not really looking at it as he is meditating on the self. Hence, there is a meeting point (Sandhi) between sight of the tip of the nose and not really looking at it. Such a state of meditation is glorified as meditation of the self itself on account of its’ importance.

atha hainaṃ brahmacāriṇa ūcuḥ kiṃ japyenāmṛtatvaṃ brūhīti ॥ sa hovāca yājñavalkyaḥ । śatarudriyeṇetyetānyeva ha vā amṛtasya nāmāni ॥ etairha vā amṛto bhavatīti evamevaitadyājñavalkyaḥ ॥ 3॥

Meaning: Then the brahmacharins asked Yajnavalkya, “Tell us, by recitation of which, does one obtain the state of the individual self (amṛtatvaṃ)? Yajnavalkya said, “By the Satarudriya, which comprises the names indicating the auspicious attributes of Brahman who is nectar (amṛta). By (reciting this), one attains the individual self that is immortal (amṛta)”.

“It is even as you said, Yajnavalkya”.

The last mantra said to fix one’s gaze on the tip of the nose and engage the mind in meditation. But the mind always strays towards sense objects and this is difficult. So the students asked, “how can we control the mind (and senses) to attain “amṛtatvaṃ” or the state of the individual self which is imperishable?”

To that, Yajnavalkya replied that recitation of the Satarudriya curbs the senses and mind, by weaning them away from sense objects and focusing them on Brahman. It contains the names, which are indicative of the auspicious attributes of Brahman that are delectable (yāni nāmāni gaunāni), and so he is nectar (amṛta). Thus by meditating on Brahman, one attains the individual self (amṛta).

Once again, the Satarudriya is praised as an accessory to Jnāna-Yoga. This should remove any misconception that it is a praise of Rudra or any god other than Narayana.

The rest of the Upanishad will not be commented upon by us as mentioned earlier. We will conclude our series of preludes here. The key takeaways from this series are as follows:

- A number of adjectives usually used to describe Paramātma are used in the Shastra to describe the Jivātma as well.
    

  

- A simplification of Jivātma- Upāsaṇa into three steps is this – controlling the senses, fixing the mind and senses on Brahman, meditating on Brahman via the Praṇava to attain the similar state of the individual self.
    

  

- The first step, viz., control of the senses can be achieved by the chanting of the Satarudriyam which is specifically intended to wean senses away from sense-objects and focus them on Brahman according to the Satapata Brahmana.
    

  

- On account of the importance of the Satarudriyam in controlling the senses, it is glorified wherever Jivātma- Upāsaṇa is described
    

  

- Thus, wherever it is said that SatarudiIyam confers immortality, it refers to kaivalya mukti (attaining the Jivātma) eventually. Just as Hari-Nama is said to confer liberation in the sense of leading to bhakti-yoga and then gaining moksha by virtue of it, the Satarudriyam confers kaivalya mukti in the sense of leading to control of senses and proceeding to Jnāna-Yoga.
    

  

- On account of the above, it is clearly established that the Satarudriyam has no connection to the worship of Shiva as described in the Tāmasa Purāṇās.
    

Hope the readers found these prelude articles interesting.
