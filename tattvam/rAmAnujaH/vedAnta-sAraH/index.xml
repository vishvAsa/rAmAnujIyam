      <description>&lt;p&gt;TODO: Proofread and align with clean sanksrit text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;वेदान्तसारः&lt;br&gt;&#xA;भगवद्रामानुजकृतः&lt;br&gt;&#xA;VEDANTASĀRA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;OF&lt;br&gt;&#xA;BHAGAVAD RĀMĀNUJA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;EDITED BY&lt;br&gt;&#xA;PANDIT V. KRISHNAMACHARYA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;WITH&lt;br&gt;&#xA;English Translation by&lt;br&gt;&#xA;SRI M. B. NARASIMHA AYYANGAR, M.Sc.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;THE ADYAR LIBRARY&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1953&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;०&#34;&gt;०&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;१-preface&#34;&gt;१ PREFACE&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE Vedantasara is an easy and concise commentary on the Brahmasutras of Badarāyaṇa who is believed to be identical with Vyasa, the famous author of the Mahābhārata. The Vedantasara was written by Bhagavad Ramanuja (1017 to 1137 A.D.) in accordance with the views of the Vis&amp;rsquo;iṣṭadvaita school of Vedanta. Sri Ramanuja was born at Sriperumbudur near Kāñici- puram as the son of Kes&amp;rsquo;avasomayājin and Bhudevi. He was the pupil of Mahāpūrṇa and younger con- temporary of Sri Yamunācārya of Srirangam. His other works are: S&amp;rsquo;ribhāṣya, Bhagavadgitābhāṣya, Vedarthasaṁgraha, Vedāntadipa, Gadyatraya and Nityagrantha. Regarding the complete biography of Sri Ramanuja, the attention of the readers is drawn to the Rāmānujacampu of Rāmānujācārya, published in the Madras Govt. Oriental MS. Series No. 6. His doctrine and teaching have been fully dealt with by Prof. P. N. Srinivasacarya in his book entitled The Philosophy of Vis&amp;rsquo;iṣṭadvaita&amp;rsquo; published in the Adyar Library Series No. 39. This system was first expound- ed by Sri Nathamuni, was developed to a great extent by Srl Yamunācārya through his works and was well preserved by Sri Ramanuja through his works like the&#xA;vi&#xA;Sribhāṣya, and Vedarthasaṁgraha, after refuting the contrary views of the opponents.&#xA;Perhaps this edition of the Vedantasara with English translation is unique in its kind and I believe it will render great and valuable service to the research scholars in their comparative and critical study of the Vedanta philosophy.&#xA;The under mentioned MSS. and printed book have been used for this edition:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
