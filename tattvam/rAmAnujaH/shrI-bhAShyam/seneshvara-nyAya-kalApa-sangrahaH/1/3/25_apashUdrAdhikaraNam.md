1.3.9 अपशूद्राधिकरणम्  
स्वाध्यायहीना अपि भारतादीन् श्रुत्वाऽथ विज्ञाय परं पुमांसम् ।  
उपासते शूद्रगणा इतीदं न सत्, निषेधात् श्रवणादिकस्य ॥ 37 ॥

1.3.9 अपशूद्राधिकरणम् The view that those who do not come under the category of the class of twice - born meditate upon the Supreme Brahman by knowing the true nature of the latter from the महाभारत and other texts although they do not study the Veda-s is wrong because of clear prohibition of vedic study in their case. Notes : The महाभारत and other texts reiterate the knowledge derived from the vedic studies and so there is no chance of these who are not twice - born getting this knowledge from texts such as the महाभारत and the like without the necessary background from the study of the Veda-s.
