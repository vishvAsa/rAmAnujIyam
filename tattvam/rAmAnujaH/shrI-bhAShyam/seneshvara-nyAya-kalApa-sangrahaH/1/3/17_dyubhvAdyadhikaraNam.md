1.3.1 द्युभ्वाद्यधिकरणम्  
मनः प्रभृत्यक्षसमाश्रयत्वात् द्युभ्वाश्रयः चेतन एव नान्यः ।  
एवं न शङ्क्यं स्फुटं आत्मशब्दात् मुक्तोपसृप्य व्यपदेशतश्च ॥ 29 ॥

1.3.1 द्युभ्वाद्यधिकरणम् It is argued that in the मुण्डक text (II.ii.5) 'In Him heaven the earth, and the sky are woven, as also the mind with all the senses; know that Self', the word 'Self' which is said to be the substratum of heaven etc., is the individual soul only as the latter alone is the locus of mind with all the senses. This argument is not sound in view of the fact that the word Self unqualified by any term represents Brahman1 only. Further it is said that the knower of this self attains liberation2. Notes : 1. See मुण्ड् Up. II, ii.7. Brahman may be described as the abode of mind, etc. Vide : महानारायणोपनिषद् XIII. viii. 12. 2. मुण्ड् Up., III.i.3.
