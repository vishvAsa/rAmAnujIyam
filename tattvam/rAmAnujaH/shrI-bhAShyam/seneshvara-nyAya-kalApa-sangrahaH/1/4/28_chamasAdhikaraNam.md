'अजां' इत्येतस्मिन् वचसि गदितं तन्वगदितं प्रधानं स्वातन्त्र्यात्  
सकलजगती सर्गकरणात् ।  
इदं नैवैतस्मिन् खलु सृजतिमात्रं त्वभिहितं विशेषस्याभावात् वदति च विशेषं   
श्रुतिरतः ॥ 46 ॥

1.4.2 चमसाधिकरणम् It is contended that the word अजा in the text of the श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषद् (IV.5) 'There is one अजा consisting of sattva, rajas and tamas producing manifold offspring of the same nature', the word अजा stands for the प्रकृति which is mentioned in the साङ्ख्य system as the independent cause of the creation of the world. This contention is wrong. It is because in this text अजा is admitted to be the cause of creation alone of the world, and it is not stated that it is an independent cause, and there is no mention of any special characteristic. The श्वेताश्वतर text states that this अजा has Brahman as its self. (Hence अजा is प्रकृति that is dependent upon Brahman). Notes : 1. श्वेत् Up., IV.10.
