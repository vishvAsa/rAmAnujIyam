Never, indeed, does a word convey an existent entity`. The author of the Brahma - सूत्र has rejected this view by pointing out that from the sentences intended to instruct children a word is well - known to signify a thing that is already existing&amp;rdquo;.1 NOTES : 1. The उपनिषदिc texts could convey Brahman the existent entity. In ordinary experience too it is noticed that a child understands the meaning of a word in isolation, that is, not associated with any activity when the mother while instructing the child utters a word by pointing out with her finger the obejct in front.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.2 जन्माद्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;भेदप्रसक्तेरनुभूत्यभावात् विशेषणं वाऽप्युपलक्षणं वा ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;जन्माद्यशक्यप्रतिपादनं यत् स्यात्तन्निरासोऽप्युभयत्व शक्तेः ॥ 8 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.2 जन्माद्यधिकरणम् The characteristics, namely, the origin, etc., of the world can not define Brahman, as there arises the unwelcome position of these signifying more than one Brahman. They can not be accidental features of Brahman too, as Brahman is not known from any other source. This section rejects this objection by stating that the characteristics can define Brahman and also indicate it1. Notes : 1. The import of the तैत्तिरीय text [III.1] &amp;ldquo;यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते, येन जातानि जीवन्ति, यत् प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति - तद्विजिज्ञासस्व, तद्ब्रह्म । That from which these things originate, by which they are sustained after their origination and into which they lapse back at the time of dissolution - seek to know that&amp;rsquo;; That is Brahman is discussed in this अधिकरण The characteristics such as the origin of the world, etc., are not contradictory to each other as they have reference to different times of origination, sustenance and dissolution. And also they could convey one and the same Brahman. This is analogous to the defining of the person Devadatta with the characteristics of being tall, fair - looking, etc., wherein the characteristics are not contradictory to each other. It comes to this : the characteristics of being the origin of the world, etc., can define Brahman. Further one can have the idea of Brahman from the etymological derivation of the work - Brahman as one having बृहत्वात् बृंहणत्वात् supra - normal greatness and power of growth. Thus we have an idea of Brahman prior to the functioning of the तैत्तिरीय text cited above. so the characteristics such as the origin, etc., of the world can indicate Brahman by serving as its accidental features. Therefore knowledge of Brahman through these characteristics is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.3 शास्त्रयोनित्वाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;कार्यत्वतः सावयवत्त्व सिद्धात् कर्ता च संसिद्ध्यति कारणं च ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;इत्येतदुत्सारितवान् प्रदूष्य शास्त्रैकगम्यत्व समर्थनेन ॥ 9 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.3 शास्त्रयोनित्वाधिकरणम् Brahman is proved as the material and the efficient cause of the world through inference of the form that the world in view of its being made up of parts is an effect and it must have a material and an efficient cause. (And, Brahman is so). The author of the सूत्र - s pointing out defects in the above view has rejected it and has established that Brahman could be, known only through the उपनिषद्-s.1 Notes : 1. Since Brahman, that is Lord नारायण has cit and acit as His body. He is the material and the efficient cause of the world. And this fact could be ascertained only from the उपनिषदिc texts such as (From which these things originate, by which they are sustained after their origination, and into which they lapse back at the time of dissolution - seek to know that (Taitt. Up. III.1) अनुमान could only prove that the world being an effect must have a cause. It is not capable of proving that such a cause must be one, omniscient and omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्रयोजनं ब्रह्मणि नैव लब्धं सिद्धे प्रवृत्तिस्त्वथवा निवृत्तिः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;इत्यप्रमात्वं हि विशङ्क्य नुन्नं स्वतः फलत्वेन परस्य पुंसः ॥ 10 ॥&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;व्युत्पत्त्यभावात् प्रतिपत्तिदौस्स्थ्यात् अन्येन सिद्धेरफलत्वतश्च ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;अमात्वमाशङ्क्य निराचकार न्यायैश्चतुर्भिः प्रतिपाद्य तत्तत् ॥ 11 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम् Having raised the doubt as to the validity of the उपनिषद्-s in respect of Brahman - the existent entity on the ground that the knowledge of Brahman admitted to arise from them, does not prompt one towards activity or restrain one from committing an interdicted action, the author of the सूत्र-s has rejected the doubt by establishing that Brahman which is the self of all - beings is the one that an aspirant seeks after1. Notes : 1. The पूर्वमीमांसा school argues that sentences such as &amp;ldquo;He who desires heaven shall perform ज्योतिष्टोम sacrifice&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;ज्योतिष्टोमेन स्वर्गकामो यजेत&amp;quot;and &amp;ldquo;A man of spiritual birth should not be killed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;rsquo; ब्राह्मणो न हन्तव्यः &amp;rsquo; acquire validity by giving rise to the cognition that prompts one to activity or restrains one from certain act. The knowledge of Brahman arising from the उपनिषदिc texts neither prompts one towards activity nor restrains him from some act. Hence the उपनिषदिc texts are not valid. This contention is answered by saying that Brahman is known from the उपनिषद्-s as of the nature of Bliss. He who experiences such a bliss has attained the highest human end. Thus the उपनिषदिc texts by conveying something which is of Supreme value to the soul are valid in respect of Brahman. 1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम् On these four aphorisms, the author of the सूत्र-s has rejected on the basis of reasoning the prima facie suppositions. 1. the words of the उपनिषद्-s cannot signify Brahman - the existent entity; 2. Brahman can not be defined; 3. It is revealed by other means of knowledge; and, 4. the inquiry is of no value1. Notes : 1. See तत्त्वटीका काञ्ची edn., p.9&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.5 ईक्षत्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;गौणी तु गौणेक्षण साहचर्यात् ईक्षा यतस्तज्जगतां निदानम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्रधानं इत्येदपाचकार मुख्यं यतो वीक्षणं आत्मशब्दात् ॥ 12 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.5 ईक्षत्यधिकरणम् It is said: thinking on the part of sat is only figurative as it is conveyed in the sentence that occurs in the context1 - where thinking is used in a figurative sense. Since it is so, प्रधान is the cause of the world. The author of the सूत्र-s rejects this view on the ground that the word &amp;rsquo;thinking&amp;rsquo; is used in the primary sense, as sat with reference to which thinking is attributed is referred to as the self (of श्वेतकेतु)2. Notes : 1. The छान्दोग्य text &amp;lsquo;That fire thought&amp;rsquo; तत्तेज ऐक्षत (VI.ii.3) is referred to here. 2. The prima facie view that the cause of the world that is referred to in the तैत्तिरीय text (III.1) is not Brahman, but is only प्रकृति which is inert is rejected here. The cause of the world is referred to by the term sat in the छान्दोग्य text &amp;lsquo;Sat alone was there at the beginning&amp;rsquo; सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीत् (VI.ii.1). The same text then states later &amp;lsquo;It (sat) contemplated&amp;rsquo; तदैक्षत । And the activity of contemplation is not possible in the case of an inert entity like प्रधान It might be thought that &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; is used in a secondary sense with regard to sat and so sat may be viewed as प्रकृति - the inert principle. It can not be so because sat is referred to later in the छान्दोग्य text (VI.viii.7) ऐतदात्म्यमिदं सर्वम् । तत् सत्यम् । स आत्मा । तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो । as the self of श्वेतकेतु and an inert principle can not be the self of श्वेतकेतु - an intelligent being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.6 आनन्दमयाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;विकारवाची मयडित्यमुष्मात् क्षेत्रज्ञमानन्दमयं विशङ्क्य ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;असंभवात् प्राणमये च हानेः प्राचुर्यवाचीति निराचकार ॥ 13 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.6 आनन्दमयाधिकरणम् A doubt is raised : The suffix मयट् in the word आनन्दमय (in the text)1 signifies modification. Hence the word refers to the soul. This doubt is removed by stating that the suffix मयट् is proved to be significative of abundance, as the sence of modification is given up even in the interpretative of the word प्राणमय.2 Notes : 1. anyontara आत्मा आनन्दमयः Taitt. Up., II.5. 2. In the case of प्राण there is no possibility of its undergoing any modification, whatsoever. It conveys the sense of abundance, as प्राण is discernible on its five functions of the प्राण, अपान, व्यान, उदान and समान.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.7 अन्तरधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;देहित्वतश्चेतन एव कश्चित् पुण्योत्तरो मण्डलमध्यवर्ती ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;इत्येवमुत्सारयते स्म शङ्कां लोकेशताद्यैः परमात्मधर्मैः ॥ 14 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.7 अन्तरधिकरणम् Since the person who is said to exist in the midst of the solar - orb is said to have a body, there arises the doubt that person must be only an individual soul with supra - normal powers. The author of the Brahma - सूत्र-s has dispelled this doubt by pointing out that that person is Supreme Brahman only in view of references to him as possessing the qualities of the Supreme Being like lordship over the world, etc1. Notes : 1. The import of the छान्दोग्य (I.vi.6) text &amp;ldquo;now that radiano person who is seen within the solar - orb&amp;rdquo; - अथ य एषोऽन्तरादित्ये हिरण्मयः पुरुषो दृश्यते । etc., is discussed here. The person that is referred to as being present in the solar - orb is the Supreme Being because the उपनिषद् (छान्द् Up., VIII.i.5) एष आत्माऽपहतपाप्मा विजरः विमृत्युर्विशोको विजिघत्सोऽपिपासः सत्यकामःt सत्यसंकल्पः । later attributes qualities like being the creator of the Universe, etc., the qualities that apply only to the Supreme Being with reference to that person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1.8 आकाशाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;आकाश इत्येव विशेषनाम्ना स व तु स्यात् जगतां निदानम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राणोऽथवेत्येतदपाचकार भूताभिसंवेशमुखैश्च लिङ्गैः ॥ 15 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1.8 आकाशाधिकरणम् AND प्राणाधिकरणम् The doubt that आकाश or प्राण in view of their being specifically mentioned may be thought of as the cause of the world is removed by the author of the सूत्र by pointing out that आकाश and प्राण referred to signifying the Supreme Being in view of the fact that they are stated to be the final goal to be attained by all souls. Notes : 1. The import of the छान्दोग्य text (I.ix.i) &amp;ldquo;all beings take their rise from आकाश only and dissolve in it&amp;rdquo; - सर्वाणि ह वा इमानि भूतान्याकाशादेव समुत्पद्यन्ते; आकाशं प्रत्यस्तं यन्ति; and that of another text of the same उपनिषद् (I.ii.4) &amp;ldquo;all these beings merge in प्राण alone and from प्राण they rise&amp;rdquo; are discussed here. The words आकाश and प्राण denote the Supreme Being and not the elemental ether and the vital air. It is because the छान्दोग्य texts आकाश is their ultimate resort&amp;quot; (I.ix.2) and &amp;ldquo;all beings merge in प्राण (I.ii.5) mention that आकाश and प्राण are the ultimate resort of all beings including sentient souls. Neither the elemental ether nor the vital air can be the final goal to be attained by the souls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is because with reference to this &amp;rsquo;light&amp;rsquo; another text2 states that the elements constitute its one foot. And this is applicable only to the Supreme Being.

And he has instructed Pratardana to meditate upon him (Indra) as life and immortality1. Hence Indra is the cause of the world. This view is not correct. It is because such instruction (by Indra to Pratardana) is based upon Indra`s realization of the Supreme Being as his inner controller who has immortality as His attribute.
