1.1.1 जिज्ञासाधिकरणम् 1.1.1 जिज्ञासाधिकरणम् "The significative relation between words and their senses is well - known to be in respect of something that is to be achieved, and it is known from the usages of the experienced people. Never, indeed, does a word convey an existent entity`. The author of the Brahma - सूत्र has rejected this view by pointing out that from the sentences intended to instruct children a word is well - known to signify a thing that is already existing".1 NOTES : 1. The उपनिषदिc texts could convey Brahman the existent entity. In ordinary experience too it is noticed that a child understands the meaning of a word in isolation, that is, not associated with any activity when the mother while instructing the child utters a word by pointing out with her finger the obejct in front.
