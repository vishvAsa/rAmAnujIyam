1.2.3 अन्तराधिकरणम्  
अक्ष्यन्तरस्त्वेष इति प्रसिद्ध्या जीवोऽथवा बिम्बम् अथापि दैवम् ।  
इत्यप्यसत् स्यात् अमृतत्वशब्दात् सुखश्रुतेश्चाप्यनवस्थितेश्च ॥ 23 ॥

1.2.3 अन्तराधिकरणम् The view that this person that is inside the eye is either the soul or the reflection of a person in the eye or the deity that presides over the function of the eye1 is wrong. It is because this person is referred to as immortal; the subejct - maoter of the section2 where this text is found is Brahman characterized by bliss; and the soul, etc., do not exist in the eye3. Notes : 1. The import of the passage - 'This person that is seen inside the eye is the self' य एषोऽक्षिणि पुरुषो दृश्यते, एष आत्मेति होवाच । This is immortal and fearless (छान्द्. IV.xv.1) is discussed herein. As the person is referred to as 'this', there arises the doubt whether the person is the soul or the reflection of a person in the eye or the presiding deity of the eye. 2. छान्द् Up., IV.x.5. 3. The soul exists in the heart, the reflection of a person in the eye do not exist always, and the presiding deity rests in the rays of the eyes.
