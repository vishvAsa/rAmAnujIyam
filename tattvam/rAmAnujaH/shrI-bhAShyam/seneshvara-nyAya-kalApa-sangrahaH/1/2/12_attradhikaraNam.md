1.2.2 अत्त्रधिकरणम्  
अत्ता तु जीवो न परः स्वतन्त्रः स एव यत्कर्मफलोपभोगी ।  
इत्यप्यसत् तद्धि चराचरस्य मृत्यूपसेकात् अदनं त्वपीतिः ॥ 22 ॥

1.2.2 अत्त्रधिकरणम् The view that the one who eats is not the Supreme Being but the soul - who is independent and who is the agent of actions and the experient of the results of actions is not sound in view of the fact that eating of the movable and the immovable world with Lord of Death as condiment means reabsorption of the entire world1. Notes : 1. The import of the text of the कठोपनिषद् - 'who knows where He is, to whom the ब्राह्मण-s and the क्षत्रिय-s are but food and Death itself a condiment (I.ii.25) is discussed in this verse.
