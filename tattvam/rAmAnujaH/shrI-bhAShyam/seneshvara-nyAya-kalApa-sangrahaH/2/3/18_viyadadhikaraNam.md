2.3.1 वियदधिकरणम्  
उत्पत्तिमन्तो न यथैव जीवाः नभश्च नोत्पत्तिमत् अंशहानेः ।  
इति त्वसारं वदति श्रुतिश्चेत् तथैव तत् स्यात् न तु तर्कभङ्गः ॥ 25 ॥

2.3.1 वियदधिकरणम् It is argued that just like the individual soul who is partless and therefore not created, ether आकाश too which is partless is not created. This argument is based on the syllogism, 'that whichever is partless cannot be created, like the individual soul'. This prima facie view is unsound. The श्रुति text clearly states that ether is produced from आत्मन् and the syllogism cited above can not hold good here because it is in conflict with the श्रुति text. Notes : 1. 'From the आत्मन् originated the ether', Taitt. Up., II.1. 2. Any प्रमाण whether it is प्रत्यक्ष or अनुमान that is in conflict with the श्रुति texts is invalid.
