2.3.3 आत्माधिकरणम् On the authority of the text 'तोयेन जीवान् vyasasarja भूम्याम्'1, which means 'He created the individual soul along with the five elements', and on the strength of the promissory statement, 'Brahman alone existed before creation'2 it is contended that the individual souls are created like the elements and that they are not even existent entities. This objection is set aside by stating that if the individual soul is accepted to be created, then there would result the unwelcome position of not experiencing the fruits of karma one has performed, and, experiencing the fruits of karma one has not performed. Moreover,the श्रुति-s declare him to be eternal.3 Notes : 1. Taitt. Up., I.4 2. छान्द् Up., VI.13. 3. (i) श्वेत् Up., VI.13. (ii) श्वेत् Up., I.9. (iii) कठ् Up., II. 1.8.
