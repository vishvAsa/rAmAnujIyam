2.2.3 समुदायाधिकरणम् The view that earth etc., are only the aggregate of atoms - and, the sense - organs, etc., are the variants of the elements of earth, etc., is not sound.1 It is because atoms are momentary and hence there is no possibility of their forming an aggregate. Whence could there be the origination of an effect. Notes : 1. According to Buddhists, earth, water, fire and air and also the sense - organs are only the aggregate of their respective atoms. atoms are momentary according to that school. Further, there is no enduring principle that could bring in the aggregation of the atoms. Hence the Buddhistic theory is unsound.
