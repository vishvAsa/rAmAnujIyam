2.4.2 सप्तगत्यधिकरणम् The कठोपनिषद् text explicitly states 'that the seven sense - organs are withdrawn from the obejcts in the state of trance' and the मुण्डक passage - sapta ime लोकाः etc., clearly speaks of the seven sense - organs as directed toward the seven worlds. Therefore it should be concluded that the sense - organs are seven only. This contention is not correct. The श्रुति दशेमे पुरुषे प्राणाःi आत्मा एकादशः and the गीता text clearly state that there are eleven sense - organs. Regarding the कठोपनिषद् passage which declare the sense organs as seven only, it is replied that it is only the ज्ञानेन्द्रिय-s which are necessary for meditation that are mentioned therein.
