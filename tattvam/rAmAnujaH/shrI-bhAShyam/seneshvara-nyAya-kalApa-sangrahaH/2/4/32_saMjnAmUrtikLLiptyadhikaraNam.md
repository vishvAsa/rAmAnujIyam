2.4.8 संज्ञामूर्तिकॢप्त्यधिकरणम्  
नामादिसृष्टिस्तु हिरण्यगर्भात् भवेत् 'अनेने'ति तु वाक्यभावात् ।  
नैवं परादेव तु तच्छरीरात् सेयं त्रिवृत्कार समानकर्तुः ॥ 42 ॥

2.4.8 संज्ञामूर्तिकॢप्त्यधिकरणम् The छान्दोग्य text (Vi.iii.2) 'anena जीवेन आत्मना अनुप्रविश्य नामरूपे व्याकरवाणि according to the पूर्वपक्ष conveys only Brahma, the four - faced Lord as the creator of the व्यष्टि in which names and forms are differentiated. The view is wrong because in the context under reference, only Brahman which is spoken of as the cause of quintuplication, is stated to enter along with soul to make name and form. Moreover, the four - faced ब्रह्मा is but the body of the Supreme and the text means that Brahman having the four - faced ब्रह्मा as His body entered into the obejcts and distinguished them into names and forms.
