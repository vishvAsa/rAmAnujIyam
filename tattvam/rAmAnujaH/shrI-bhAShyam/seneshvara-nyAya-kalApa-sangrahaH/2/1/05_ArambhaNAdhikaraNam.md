2.1.6 आरम्भणाधिकरणम् The view that the non - difference between cause and effect will not hold good because the cognition, name material shape and practical efficiency that pertain to the cause are different from those that pertain to the effect, and also because the causal operation will become futile1 is not sound. It is because in the उपनिषदिc text such as 'This world prior to creation existed as sat' (छान्द् Up. VI.ii.1), 'This world prior to creation existed as Brahman' (बृह् Up., I.iv.ii), 'This world prior to creation existed as आत्मन् (Ait. Up., I.i.1) and the like, the words idam (this world) and sat, Brahman and आत्मन् having co - ordinate relation convey the non - difference between the world - the effect and Brahman - the cause. The difference in words that denote the cause and effect (which are non - different from each other) is merely due to the difference in the modes that pertain to the causal substance.2 There is also no futility of the causal operation. Notes : 1. According to this view the cause is non - different from the effect. The latter will exist in the cause prior to its origination. Since the effect pre - exists in the cause there is no need for causal operation. 2. According to the सिद्धान्त the causal substance itself when associated with a new mode or condition is viewed as effect. Causal operation is necessary to bring in the new mode.
