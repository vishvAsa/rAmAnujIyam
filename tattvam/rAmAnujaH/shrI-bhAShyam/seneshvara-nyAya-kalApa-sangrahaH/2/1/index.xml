      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.1 स्मृत्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;स्मृतेर्विरोधादुपबृंहणस्य न ब्रह्म हेतुर्जगतामितीदम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;असारमन्यस्मृतिभिर्विरोधात् तेषां त्वनाप्तिश्च न शक्यशङ्का ॥ 1 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.1 स्मृत्यधिकरणम् The contention that Brahman can not be considered to be the cause of the world as such a view is contradictory to the स्मृति text of sage Kapila - the text that substantiates the teaching of स्मृति is wrong in view of the fact that there would then arise contradiction with other स्मृति texts (that speak of Brahman as the cause of the world). Further the rejection of the doctrine that Brahman is the cause of the world would result in the defect of leaving no scope for some other स्मृति-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.2 योगप्रत्युक्त्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तसमर्थितोऽर्थः तत्सेश्वर स्मृत्यनुसारहानेः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;असाध्वितीदं न, परैर्विरोधात् जीवत्वतो विभ्रमसंभवाच्च ॥ 2 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.2 योगप्रत्युक्त्यधिकरणम् The contention that Brahman which is established to be the import of the उपनिषद्-s is not so because there would then result contradiction with the स्मृति texts propounded by हिरण्यगर्भ being a एईव is subject to delusion (and so his views can not be authoritative). Further the contention that Brahman can not be the cause of the world is contradictory to many other स्मृति texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.3 विलक्षणत्वाधिकरणम् 2.1.4&lt;br&gt;&#xA;यद्यत्कार्यं न तत्तत्प्रतिभटगुणकं ब्रह्म चेदं च विश्वम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ज्ञात्वाज्ञत्वादि धर्मैः प्रतिभयमथ चेदीक्षणाच्चेतनत्वम् ॥ 3 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.3 विलक्षणत्वाधिकरणम् and 2.1.4 शिष्टापरिग्रहाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is that which is an effect can not have a quality different from the cause. Brahman and the world are of different character as the former is sentient and the latter, insentient. (Hence Brahman can not be the cause of the world). If it is said that the world too is sentient (on the basis of the तैत्तिरीय संहिता text V.v.2) &amp;lsquo;The earth said to him&amp;rsquo; it is answered that it is a reference to the presiding deity of the earth. This view is not sound. It is noticed that worms, etc., are produced from honey. And the effect and the cause have different nature. If it is said that the cause - effect relation between honey and worms exists only in respect of the material part in both, then it is answered that the same substance becomes modified into the form of an effect and this is enough to prove that Brahman is the cause and the world is the effect. The cause and effect may or may not have similar characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.5 भोक्त्रापत्त्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तत्तासां देवतानामिति तु न चतुरं दृश्यते मक्षिकादेः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;कृम्यादि द्रव्यभेदो यदि न भवति तत्कार्यहेत्वोरलं स्यात् ॥ 4 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.5 भोक्त्रापत्त्यधिकरणम् The contention that since Brahman has for its body the souls, it too will be an experient of pleasure and pain like the soul which has body and so Brahmah would in no way differ from the souls is wrong on the ground that in respect of Brahman there is absence of relation to karma as in the case of liberated souls. In ordinary experience too it is noticed that although the king and his subjects are embodied ones, yet paid due to punishment meted out for transgressing the king`s orders is experienced only by the subjects and not by the king.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.6 आरम्भणाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;भोक्तृत्वं स्याज्जीववद्देहवत्त्वात् इत्येतस्मान्नाधिकं ब्रह्म सिद्ध्येत् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैतच्छङ्क्यं मुक्तवत्कर्महानेः युज्येतैतत् राजवच्चापि लोके ॥ 5 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.6 आरम्भणाधिकरणम् The view that the non - difference between cause and effect will not hold good because the cognition, name material shape and practical efficiency that pertain to the cause are different from those that pertain to the effect, and also because the causal operation will become futile1 is not sound. It is because in the उपनिषदिc text such as &amp;lsquo;This world prior to creation existed as sat&amp;rsquo; (छान्द् Up. VI.ii.1), &amp;lsquo;This world prior to creation existed as Brahman&amp;rsquo; (बृह् Up., I.iv.ii), &amp;lsquo;This world prior to creation existed as आत्मन् (Ait. Up., I.i.1) and the like, the words idam (this world) and sat, Brahman and आत्मन् having co - ordinate relation convey the non - difference between the world - the effect and Brahman - the cause. The difference in words that denote the cause and effect (which are non - different from each other) is merely due to the difference in the modes that pertain to the causal substance.2 There is also no futility of the causal operation. Notes : 1. According to this view the cause is non - different from the effect. The latter will exist in the cause prior to its origination. Since the effect pre - exists in the cause there is no need for causal operation. 2. According to the सिद्धान्त the causal substance itself when associated with a new mode or condition is viewed as effect. Causal operation is necessary to bring in the new mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.7 इतरव्यपदेशाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;बुद्ध्याकाराभिधान व्यवहृतिगणनैर्भेदकैः कार्यहेत्वोः एकत्वं नैव सिध्येत्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;इति तु न चतुरं कारकानर्थता च ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;सद्ब्रह्मात्मादि शब्दैरभिहितमपृथग्येन शब्दादिभेदो द्रव्यावस्थावलंबी तत&lt;br&gt;&#xA;इह न भवेत् कारकानर्थता च ॥ 6 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.7 इतरव्यपदेशाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : &amp;rsquo;the texts - tat tvam asi and the like convey that the soul is identical with Brahman; And the soul will not create the world full of miseries. who will desire to have misery for oneself? Hence Brahman with the soul can not be viewed as the creator of the world&amp;rsquo;. This view is not sound. It is because the text &amp;lsquo;There are two birds in the body of which one experiences the fruits of actions while the other remains as a witness&amp;rsquo; श्वेत् Up., III.i.1), declares the difference between the soul and Brahman. The texts that declare non - difference between the two declare the fact that Brahman has the soul as Its body and It is its inner-self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.8 उपसंहारदर्शनाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;जीवस्य ब्रह्मभावं व्यपदिशति यतस्तत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्यं तस्माद्दुःखैककन्दं&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.8 उपसंहारदर्शनाधिकरणम् The view that that which is a cause depends upon extraneous aids to give rise to its effect and Brahman being devoid of any extraneous aid can not be the cause of the world is wrong. It is because just as milk turns into curd without the need for any extraneous aid, in the same way Brahman without depending upon any extraneous aid could be the cause of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.9 कृत्स्नप्रसक्त्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;यत्कारणं कारकसेव्यपक्षं तत्स्यात् परं ब्रह्म न तद्व्यपेक्षम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;अतो न हेतुस्त्विति नैव यस्मात् क्षीरं तु नैवेच्छति तत् दधित्वे ॥ 8 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.9 कृत्स्नप्रसक्त्यधिकरणम् The prima facie is : Brahman can not be the cause of the world on the ground that being devoid of parts if it were to get itself modified into the form of the world then there is the possibility of entire Brahman being modified. If it were held that Brahman is composed of parts then there would arise conflict with the उपनिषदिc texts that speak of Brahman as one devoid of parts. Hence Brahman can not be the cause of the world. Hence there are difficulties to either of the two positions. This view is bereft of truth. It is because Brahman is different from Its mode - the प्रकृति which is modified into the form of the world; and, it is known from the उपनिषद्-s1 that &amp;lsquo;It possesses manifold powers&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2.1.10 प्रयोजनवत्त्वाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ब्रह्म स्यात् कार्यशेषं निखिलमवयवाभावतः सांशता चेत् व्याकोपः&lt;br&gt;&#xA;स्यादिदानीमवयवविरह श्राविणीनां श्रुतीनाम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;हेतुत्वं तस्य तस्मात् विहतमुभयथेत्येतदप्यात्तसारं वैलक्षण्यात्प्रकाराच्छ्रुतिभिरपि&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तथा ज्ञापनाच्छक्तिमत्त्वात् ॥ 9 ॥&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2.1.10 प्रयोजनवत्त्वाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;कामानां समवाप्तितो न हि फलं किञ्चित् समालोक्यते सृष्टेरस्य परस्य नापि दयया&lt;br&gt;&#xA;दुःखैकहेतुत्वतः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैवैतत् स हि लीलयैव तनुते पुण्याद्यपेक्षावशात् वैषम्यादि च नास्ति कर्मवशता&lt;br&gt;&#xA;सिद्धेरनादित्वतः ॥ 10 ॥&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2.1.10 प्रयोजनवत्त्वाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;कपिलस्मृतेर्विरोधात् हिरण्यगर्भस्मृते र्विरोधाच्च ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न्यायविरोधात् भोगप्रसङ्गतः कार्यहेतुभेदाच्च ॥ 11 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1.10 प्रयोजनवत्त्वाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : Brahman which is possessed of auspicious attributes has no desire that is unfulfilled, and, therefore, has nothing to achieve or gain by creating the world. It can not be said that creation is for the benefit of others because Brahman who is compassionate can not create a world (for others) which is full of miseries. Hence it is unsound to hold Brahman as the cause. It is replied that Brahman originates the world for His recreation (or sport1). It is not correct to say that Brahman is favourably disposed towards some of the individual souls, since He creates as Gods, beasts, etc., depending upon their actions which are performed in their previous births2 and which are beginningless3 like the individual soul. Hence there can be no cruelty on His part4. Notes : 1. BS. II.i.33. 2. बृह् Up., VI.iv.5. 3. BS. II.i.35. 4. BS. II.i.34.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
