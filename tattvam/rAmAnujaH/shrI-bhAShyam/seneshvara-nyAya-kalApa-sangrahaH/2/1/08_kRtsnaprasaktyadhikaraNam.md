2.1.9 कृत्स्नप्रसक्त्यधिकरणम्  
यत्कारणं कारकसेव्यपक्षं तत्स्यात् परं ब्रह्म न तद्व्यपेक्षम् ।  
अतो न हेतुस्त्विति नैव यस्मात् क्षीरं तु नैवेच्छति तत् दधित्वे ॥ 8 ॥

2.1.9 कृत्स्नप्रसक्त्यधिकरणम् The prima facie is : Brahman can not be the cause of the world on the ground that being devoid of parts if it were to get itself modified into the form of the world then there is the possibility of entire Brahman being modified. If it were held that Brahman is composed of parts then there would arise conflict with the उपनिषदिc texts that speak of Brahman as one devoid of parts. Hence Brahman can not be the cause of the world. Hence there are difficulties to either of the two positions. This view is bereft of truth. It is because Brahman is different from Its mode - the प्रकृति which is modified into the form of the world; and, it is known from the उपनिषद्-s1 that 'It possesses manifold powers'. Notes : 1. श्वेत् Up., VI.8.
