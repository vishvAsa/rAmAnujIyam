2.1.3 विलक्षणत्वाधिकरणम् and 2.1.4 शिष्टापरिग्रहाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is that which is an effect can not have a quality different from the cause. Brahman and the world are of different character as the former is sentient and the latter, insentient. (Hence Brahman can not be the cause of the world). If it is said that the world too is sentient (on the basis of the तैत्तिरीय संहिता text V.v.2) 'The earth said to him' it is answered that it is a reference to the presiding deity of the earth. This view is not sound. It is noticed that worms, etc., are produced from honey. And the effect and the cause have different nature. If it is said that the cause - effect relation between honey and worms exists only in respect of the material part in both, then it is answered that the same substance becomes modified into the form of an effect and this is enough to prove that Brahman is the cause and the world is the effect. The cause and effect may or may not have similar characteristics.
