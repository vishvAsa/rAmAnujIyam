3.2.7 पराधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : there is something which is higher than Brahman and which is to be attained on the following grounds : (1) Brahman is said to be a bridge; (2) it is said to be limited and as such there is something else that limits it; (3) it is said to lead to immortality and this shows that there is something beyond Brahman; and (4) it is said that there is something beyond Brahman in the text 'what is beyond It is formless, sinless' etc. This view is wrong. Brahman is said to be a bridge in the sense that it binds the sentient and the insentient souls; it is said to be limited for the sake of meditative worship; and, it is said that Brahman is the means to immortality in the sense that It itself is the means to attain Itself.
