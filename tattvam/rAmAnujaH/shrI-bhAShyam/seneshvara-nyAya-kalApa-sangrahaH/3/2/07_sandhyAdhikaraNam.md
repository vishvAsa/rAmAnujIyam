3.2.1 सन्ध्याधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the soul is the creator of the dream state because he possesses the qualities such as desire that never goes unfulfilled and the like, and he is referred to in the श्रुति as the agent. This view is wrong. It is because there is the creation of obejcts unpleasant to the soul in the state of dream. Further, the qualities referred to are concealed in the state of bondage. Notes : 1. बृह् Up., IV.iii.19.
