      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.1 सन्ध्याधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;गुणित्वतः सन्निधितश्च जीवः स्वाप्नार्थकर्तेति न शंक्यमेतत् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;असंभवत्वात् अहितक्रियायाः तिरोहितत्वेन गुणस्य चास्य ॥ 10 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.1 सन्ध्याधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the soul is the creator of the dream state because he possesses the qualities such as desire that never goes unfulfilled and the like, and he is referred to in the श्रुति as the agent. This view is wrong. It is because there is the creation of obejcts unpleasant to the soul in the state of dream. Further, the qualities referred to are concealed in the state of bondage. Notes : 1. बृह् Up., IV.iii.19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.2 तदभावाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;श्रुतौ विशेषाग्रहणात् सुषुप्तेः नाड्यः पुरीतत् परमोऽथवा स्यात् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;भूमिस्त्वितीदं न, विकल्पदोषात् प्रासादखट्वाशयनादिवत् स्यात् ॥ 11 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.2 तदभावाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the छान्दोग्य text (VIII.vi.3) states that the soul in the state of deep sleep enters into the nerves; the बृहदारण्यक text (II.i.19) declares that it moves through the nerves and rests in the pericardium; and, the छान्दोग्य text (VI.viii.1) proclaims that it is united with the True. Hence the resting place of the soul in the state of deep sleep may be viewed as the nerves or the peri - cardium or Brahman. This view is wrong. It is because there would arise the defect of admitting alternatives which would mean the validity of one vedic text and the invalidity of the other. Hence it must be held that the soul in the state of deep sleep goes through the nerves to the region of the pericardium and rests there in Brahman. This is analogous to saying that one sleeps on a couch in a palace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.3 कर्मानुस्मृतिशब्दविध्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राप्त्या परस्याखिलकर्मनाशात् अन्यः प्रबोद्धा न पुनः सुषुप्तः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैवार्थवत्त्वात् विधिकर्मणोः स्यात् अनुस्मृतेः व्याघ्र इति श्रुतेश्च ॥ 12 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.3 कर्मानुस्मृतिशब्दविध्यधिकरणम् It is contended : it is only a different soul that emerges from the state of deep sleep because the one who has attained Brahman in the deep sleep state becomes rid of all Karma-s. This contention is wrong. It is because the soul has to experience the fruits of Karma done by it before it attains knowledge. Further, there is the experience of the identity of personality before and after such sleep. Again, there is the श्रुति text &amp;lsquo;whatsoever these creatures are here, whether a tiger or a lion or a wolf or a bear that they become again&amp;rsquo; छान्द् Up., VI.ix.3). From these it is known that the self same soul returns after deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.4 मुग्धाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राणस्य सर्वेन्द्रियसंहृतेश्च व्यापारहानेर्मरणं तु मूर्च्छा ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुग्धेऽर्धलाभो मरणस्य सा स्यात् आकारवैषम्यसमुत्थितिभ्याम् ॥ 13 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.4 मुग्धाधिकरणम् Ther is the doubt regarding thte swoon state of the soul as to whether that is one among the three states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep or it is the fourth one, namely death or a state different from these. It is because in the state of swoon there is the non - operation of the sense organs, absence of conciousness, etc. This doubt is cleared by stating that it is partial death as a rises again after swoon. It is also different from the other states, as there are differences from these states in regard to the absence of happiness, dreams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.5 उभयलिङ्गाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;आत्मेच्छया वाऽप्यतिहेयभावात् पूयादिसङ्गः स परस्य दोषः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तत्स्थानसंबन्धितयेति, नैतत् सर्वत्र निर्दोषगुणित्वशब्दात् ॥ 14 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.5 उभयलिङ्गाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the Supreme Brahman, who, out of its own free will resides in a defiled place, becomes contaminated by its association with that place. This view is not correct because the Supreme Brahman is state in the scriptures as free from all inauspicious qualities. Notes : 1. &amp;lsquo;He is free from sins, old age, death, sorrow . . . whose desire never gets unfulfilled&amp;rsquo; - छान्द् Up., VIII.i.5. &amp;lsquo;He is Omniscient and all - knowing&amp;rsquo; - मुण्ड् Up. I.i.9.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.6 अहिकुण्डलाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नानात्वैकत्वयुक्तेः परिणमनमचित्त्वेन चेत् बाधितत्वं निर्दोषत्वश्रुतेः।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;स्यात् अथ तदुभययोरेक सामान्ययोगः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैतत् स्यान्नैव लोके क्वचिदपि कथितः खण्डशब्देन मुण्डः तस्मादंशत्वमंशित्वमपि&lt;br&gt;&#xA;हि जगतो ब्रह्मणश्चाऽऽत्मवत् स्यात् ॥ 15 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.6 अहिकुण्डलाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : The relation between Brahman and the world may be viewed as one of difference and non - difference (as between a serpent and its coils). If it is held that such a view would result in Brahman undergoing a change and thereby the texts that declare छन्गेलेस्सूएस्स् in Brahman will be contradicted, then it may be held that the relation between Brahman and the world is similar to the one that exists between light and its substratum, which although different are non - different as fire. This view does not hold good : it is because never indeed in ordinary experience is a hornless entity referred to as one with broken horns. [Hence Brahman can not thus be viewed as different and non - different at once from the world.] nust as there is the relation of part and the whole between the soul and Brahman, in the same way the world is an attribute of Brahman and so a part of Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.7 पराधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;सेतुत्वव्यपदेशतो मिततया संशब्दनात् प्रापक- श्रुत्या चापि &amp;lsquo;ततो यदुत्तरतरं&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;त्वित्येव भेदग्रहात् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राप्योऽन्यः परतोऽपि कश्चिदिति यन्नैतत् त्वसंभेदनात्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ध्येयत्वादपवर्गसाधनतया हेतुत्वसंशब्दनात् ॥ 16 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.7 पराधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : there is something which is higher than Brahman and which is to be attained on the following grounds : (1) Brahman is said to be a bridge; (2) it is said to be limited and as such there is something else that limits it; (3) it is said to lead to immortality and this shows that there is something beyond Brahman; and (4) it is said that there is something beyond Brahman in the text &amp;lsquo;what is beyond It is formless, sinless&amp;rsquo; etc. This view is wrong. Brahman is said to be a bridge in the sense that it binds the sentient and the insentient souls; it is said to be limited for the sake of meditative worship; and, it is said that Brahman is the means to immortality in the sense that It itself is the means to attain Itself.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3.2.8 फलाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;साक्षात् क्रमात् वा फलदत्वदृष्टेः अत्रापि कर्मैव फलं ददातु ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैवेदमन्यार्थतया तु कॢप्तेः श्रुतिस्मृतिभ्यश्च स एव दत्ते ॥ 17 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.2.8 फलाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : Actions (like ploughing, etc.,) are known in ordinary experience as giving their fruits either directly or indirectly. so let karma or ritual - action itself give forth its fruit. This view is wrong. It is because ritual - action is well - known to be the means of gratifying the Lord. On the basis of the scriptural text, and the स्मृति text it is only God who dispenses the fruits of actions. Notes : 1. बृह् Up., IV.iv.24. 2. BG. VII.21.23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
