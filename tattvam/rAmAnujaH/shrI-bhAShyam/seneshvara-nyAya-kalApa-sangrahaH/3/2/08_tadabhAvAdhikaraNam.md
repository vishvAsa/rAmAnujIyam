3.2.2 तदभावाधिकरणम्  
श्रुतौ विशेषाग्रहणात् सुषुप्तेः नाड्यः पुरीतत् परमोऽथवा स्यात् ।  
भूमिस्त्वितीदं न, विकल्पदोषात् प्रासादखट्वाशयनादिवत् स्यात् ॥ 11 ॥

3.2.2 तदभावाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the छान्दोग्य text (VIII.vi.3) states that the soul in the state of deep sleep enters into the nerves; the बृहदारण्यक text (II.i.19) declares that it moves through the nerves and rests in the pericardium; and, the छान्दोग्य text (VI.viii.1) proclaims that it is united with the True. Hence the resting place of the soul in the state of deep sleep may be viewed as the nerves or the peri - cardium or Brahman. This view is wrong. It is because there would arise the defect of admitting alternatives which would mean the validity of one vedic text and the invalidity of the other. Hence it must be held that the soul in the state of deep sleep goes through the nerves to the region of the pericardium and rests there in Brahman. This is analogous to saying that one sleeps on a couch in a palace.
