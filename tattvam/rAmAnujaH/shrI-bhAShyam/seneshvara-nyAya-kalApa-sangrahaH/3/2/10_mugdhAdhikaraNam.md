3.2.4 मुग्धाधिकरणम् Ther is the doubt regarding thte swoon state of the soul as to whether that is one among the three states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep or it is the fourth one, namely death or a state different from these. It is because in the state of swoon there is the non - operation of the sense organs, absence of conciousness, etc. This doubt is cleared by stating that it is partial death as a rises again after swoon. It is also different from the other states, as there are differences from these states in regard to the absence of happiness, dreams, etc.
