3.3.16 कामाद्यधिकरणम्  
आकाशतच्छयानौ समुपास्यौ यदि न दहरविद्यैका ।  
सामान्यात्तु गुणानां क्वचिदाकाशस्य हृदयवाचित्वात् ॥ 36 ॥

3.3.16 कामाद्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the छान्दोग्य the small space is enjoined as an obejct of meditation. In the बृहदारण्यक the one who is present in the space is enjoined as an obejct of meditation. Hence the two meditations are different. This view is wrong. The word आकाश or space stands for heart and it is Brahman who is immanent in the heart is the obejct of meditation in both the cases. Further the qualities of being the controller of all, the Lord of all are mentioned in common in both the cases. Notes : 1. VII.i.1. 2. IV.iv.22.
