3.3.15 अन्तरत्वाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the बृहदारण्यक याज्ञावल्क्य while answering the question of उशस्त in regard to the nature of Brahman that is immediate and direct said that it sustains life in all beings. And to the same question put by Kahola, याज्ञावल्क्य said that it transcends hunger and thirst, death and decay etc. There is distinction between two meditations as one refers to Brahman as sustaining life in all beings and another refers to Brahman as beyond hunger. This view is wrong. It is because the question and answers refer to the same Brahman. This is analogus to sad - vidya where repeated questions and answers serve to distinguish one and the same Brahman and not to convey the idea that Brahman is to be meditated upon with different attributes.
