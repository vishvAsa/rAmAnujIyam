3.3.23 भूमज्यायस्त्वाधिकरणम्  
उभयत्र फलसमुक्तेः व्यस्तो व्यस्तस्समस्तो वा ।  
वैश्वानरो विचिन्त्यः नैव निषेधात् समस्त एव स्यात् ॥ 43 ॥

3.3.23 भूमज्यायस्त्वाधिकरणम् In the वैश्वानरविद्या it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is to be meditated upon as having the sky as Its head, the Sun as Its eyes, the earth as Its body, etc. It is also mentioned that meditation upon each and every aforesaid limb individually produces a specific result. Therefore, it is argued by the पूर्वपक्षिन् that meditation on the individual parts must be persued as meditation upon the parts is enjoined with specific result of its own. This position is not correct in view of the fact that the श्रुति text speaks of evil as ensuing from meditation upon the parts. Hence meditation upon the whole must be pursued. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., V.xii.2.
