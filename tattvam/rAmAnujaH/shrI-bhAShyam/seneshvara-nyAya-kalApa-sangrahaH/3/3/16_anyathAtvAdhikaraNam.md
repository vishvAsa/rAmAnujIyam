3.3.2 अन्यथात्वाधिकरणम् According to the पूर्वपक्षिन् the texts छान्दोग्य and the वाएअसनेयिन्स् enjoin meditation on उद्गीथ as there is no difference in the injunctions, the result and the obejct of meditation. This contention is not correct. According to the छान्दोग्य the प्रणव - which is a part of the उद्गीथ is the obejct of meditation as प्राण According to the वाएअसनेयिन्स् it is उद्गीथ that is the obejct of meditation as प्राण Since the obejcts of meditation differ, the injunctions too differ. Further according to the chandoga-s while the part of उद्गीथ is an obejct of meditation, according to the वाएअसनेयिन्स् the one who chants the उद्गीथ is the obejct of meditation. On this ground too, the injunctions differ. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., I.ii.7. 2. बृह् Up., III.iii.2. 3. छान्द् Up., I, ii.7. 4. बृह् Up., III.iii.7.
