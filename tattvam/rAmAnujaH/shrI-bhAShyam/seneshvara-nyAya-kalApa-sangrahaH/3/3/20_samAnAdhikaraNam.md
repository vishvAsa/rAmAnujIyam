3.3.6 समानाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in Agnirahasya of वाएअसनेयक and in the बृहदारण्यक meditation on Brahman is enjoined. In the former text it is said that Brahman is to be meditated as having desires that are always fulfilled. In the latter text it is said that Brahman is to be meditated upon, as having the quality of Lordship, etc. Since the characteristics in the case of the obejct of meditation are different, the injunctions too are different. This view is wrong. It is because Lordship is only an aspect of the quality of desire that is invariably fulfilled. Hence the characteristics mentioned in both the texts are non - different. The injunctions also are thus non - different. Notes : 1. शतपथब्राह्मण D. vi.3. 2. बृह् Up., V.vi.1.
