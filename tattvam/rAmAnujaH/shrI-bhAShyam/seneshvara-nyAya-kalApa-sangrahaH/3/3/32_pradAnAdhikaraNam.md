3.3.18 प्रदानाधिकरणम्  
साधारणत्वहेतोः गुणी तु गुणचिन्तनेषु नावर्त्यः ।  
नैवं विशिष्टभेदात् प्रतिगुणमावर्तनीय एव गुणी ॥ 38 ॥

3.3.18 प्रदानाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the छान्दोग्य meditation upon Brahman as associated with the quality of possessing true desires is enjoined. Then meditation upon the quality of true desires alone is prescribed. In the meditation on this attribute, the meditation on Brahman as qualified by the attribute need not be repeated. This contention is wrong. It is because Brahman is to be meditated on in Its essential nature first and then there is the repetition of the meditation with a view to realizing its auspicious attributes. Notes : 1. VIII. ii.6. 2. छान्द् Up., VIII.ii.6
