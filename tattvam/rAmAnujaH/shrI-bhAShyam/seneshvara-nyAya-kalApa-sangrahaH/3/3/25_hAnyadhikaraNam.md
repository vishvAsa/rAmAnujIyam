3.3.11 हान्यधिकरणम् The छन्दोगा-s declare that 'he who knows Brahman shakes off his good and evil karma-s'. The शाट्यायनिन्-s say that in the case of the knower of Brahman, his sons take his inheritance; his friends take the good; his enemies take the evil. The नौशीतकिन्-s say that the knower of Brahman shakes of his good and evil karma-s; his dear relations take the good while his enemies take the evil. The doubt arises as to whether there is any option among the three or all ought to be combined. The prima - facie is that this is a case of option. This, however, is not correct. It is because the acquisition of karma-s by other is supplemented to the abandonment of karma-s. Hence these must necessarily be combined. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VIII.xiii.1. 2.
