3.4.6 शमदमाद्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the case of a house - holder meditation upon Brahman is not associated with control of mind, of external senses etc., as he is engaged in performance of ritual actions. This view is wrong. It is because control of mind etc., are subsidiary to meditation upon Brahman. Control of mind and sense - organs and performance of ritual actions - these two respectively operate in sphere of works enjoined and in the sphere were works are not enjoined and are devoid of any definite purpose. Notes : 1. See बृह् Up., IV.iv.23.
