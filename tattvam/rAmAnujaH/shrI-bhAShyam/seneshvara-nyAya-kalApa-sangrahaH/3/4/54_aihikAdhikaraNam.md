3.4.14 ऐहिकाधिकरणम्  
यज्ञादिकं त्वभ्युदयादिहेतुः सद्यः फलं स्यात् अविलम्बहेतोः ।  
न तत् बलिष्ठैः प्रतिबन्धहानौ तत् स्यात् 'यदेवे'ति तु चोदितत्वात् ॥ 67 ॥

3.4.14 ऐहिकाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : sacrifices, etc., which are the means to material prosperity give forth their fruit immediately as there is no cause for their fruition to be delayed. This view is wrong. It is because worldly prosperity would come into effect only when there is no obstruction by more powerful deeds. The श्रुति text 'whatever one does with meditation . . . that is more vigorous' states that works associated with the meditation on the उद्गीथ have no obstruction to deliver their fruit. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., I.i.10.
