3.4.12 सहकार्यन्तराधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the बृहदारण्यक text 'therefore a person of spiritual birth having pursued वेदान्तिc study पाण्डित्य should pursue reflection बाल्येन तिष्ठासेत् Having pursued वेदान्तिc study and reflection he should pursue meditation (atha मुनिः mauna being of the nature of knowledge has already been enjoined by the text - बाल्येन तिष्ठासेत् and hence it is only re-stated in the text atha मुनिः. and not enjoined. This view is wrong. Mauna is well - known to be intense meditation in ordinary experience (unlike mauna which is only reasoning or arguing within oneself). Hence it is to be enjoined. Notes : 1. बृह् Up., III.v.1.
