यज्ञादिकर्माङ्गकलापहानेः विद्याधिकारो न निराश्रमाणाम् ।

3.4.9 विधुराधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : widowers and others who do not belong to any आश्रम are not entitled for meditation on Brahman as they are not competent to perform ritual - actions relating to any stage of life. This view is wrong. It is because Raikva and others who do not belong to any आश्रम are known to have pursued meditation on Brahman by being aided by the uttering of mantra-s, fasting etc.
