3.4.3 पारिप्लवाधिकरणम् The sacred episodes in the उपनिषद्-s such as the dialogue between Pratardana and Indra and the like are not to be treated as serving the purpose of praises known as पारिप्लव-s to be listened to by the sacrificer in the अश्वमेध sacrifice. It is because the श्रुति text choose special episodes as suitable to पारिप्लव performance such as 'King Manu' son of Vivasvat. The episodes in the उपनिषद्-s are logically connected with the texts that inculcate injuction in regard to the meditation upon Brahman. Notes : 1. कौष् Up., I.x.7.
