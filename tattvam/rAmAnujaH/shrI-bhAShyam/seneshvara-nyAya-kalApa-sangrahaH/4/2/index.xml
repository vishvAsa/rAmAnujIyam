      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.1 वागधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;वाचो मनः कारणकत्वहानेः वृत्तेर्लयश्चेतसि नैव वाचः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तन्नैव तस्याश्च समानभावात् वाक्छब्दतः सङ्गतिमात्रतश्च ॥ 15 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.1 वागधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the श्रुति text - वाङ् मनसि सम्पद्यते - it is stated that when a person departs from here it is only the function of speech that merges in mind and not of the sense of speech because the latter does not have mind as its material cause. This view is not correct. It is because the function of speech also does not have mind as its material cause. When it is stated in the उपनिषद् that the sense of speech merges in mind what is meant is that the sense of speech comes to be associated with mind.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.2 मनोधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राणोऽम्बु तेजः प्रकृतित्वयोगात् &amp;lsquo;आपोमयः प्राणः&amp;rsquo; इति श्रुतेश्च ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न स्यादहङ्कारकृतं तु चित्तं प्राणो नभः कार्यमतः स एव ॥ 16 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.2 मनोधिकरणम् The पूर्वपक्ष view is : the प्राण is identical with water. Like water it too has tejas as its causal substance. Further there is the उपनिषदिc text - प्राण consists of water&amp;rsquo;. From this it is known that प्राण has water as its causal substance. Mind is stated to be having food as its causal substance, and food is stated to be having waters as its causal substance. Thus when it is said that mind undergoes association with प्राण we have to understand by the word प्राण the waters which constitute the causal substance of प्राण And with waters mind becomes associated. This means mind is absolved in प्राण - its cause (that is waters) in an indirect way. The above view is wrong. When it is said that mind consists of earth and प्राण consists of water what is meant is that mind and प्राण are nourished through food and water. It does not mean that food and water are causal substances of mind and प्राण Further mind is derived from अहङ्कार the principle of egotism and प्राण is the modification of ether.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.3 अध्यक्षाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्राणो भवेत् तेजसि योगभागी तथैव शब्दश्रवणात् इतीदम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न स्यात्तु जीवोपगमादिशब्दात् प्राणस्य, तेजः श्रवणं तु पश्चात् ॥ 17 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.3 अध्यक्षाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the श्रुति text states that when a person departs from here प्राण reaches the fire. This view is not correct. The text must be construed in this way. There are scriptural texts which state that at the time of death all the प्राण-s go to the soul. From this it is to be concluded that प्राण combined with the individual soul reaches fire. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.6. 2. बृह् Up., IV.iii.38.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.4 भूताधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तेजस्तु &amp;lsquo;तत्तेज&amp;rsquo; इति श्रुतत्वात् तन्मात्रमेवान्यवियुक्तरूपम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न स्यात् तु भूतान्तरसंप्रविष्टं त्रिवृत्कृतत्व श्रवणादशक्तेः ॥ 18 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.4 भूताधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the text प्राण reaches the fire it is stated that प्राण reaches only fire. This view is not correct. it is because according to triplication theory earth, water and fire are combined with one another and so each one of these consists of the other two elements. Hence प्राण reaches the fire associated with other elements too. It is to be noted that each element individualy is not capable of producing any effect.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.5 आसृत्युपक्रमाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;एषा त्वविद्यस्य गतिर्भवित्री विद्यावतोऽत्रैव पराप्तिशब्दात् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैतत् द्वयं स्यात् उभयोः समाना गतिः शरीरात् इतरोऽर्थवादः ॥ 19 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.5 आसृत्युपक्रमाधिकरणम् According to the prima facie view, the departure of the soul from the body at the time of death relates to the ignorant only and in the case of the knower the श्रुति text states that he experiences Brahman here itself. This view is not correct. The departure of soul from the body is common to the man of knowledge as well as the ignorant till the individual soul enter into veins. There is then difference in the paths. The text that declares that one experiences Brahman here itself is intended to glorify the nature of Brahman.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.6 परसंपत्त्यधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;भोगाद्यभावेन निरर्थकत्वात् यथायथं स्युर्न तु देवतायाम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;संयन्ति तानीति न शंक्यमेतत् &amp;lsquo;तेजः परस्यां&amp;rsquo; इति चोदितत्वात् ॥ 20 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.6 परसंपत्त्यधिकरणम् A doubt arises as to whether the subtle elements merged with the soul produce their appropriate effects or merge themselves with the soul. The पूर्वपक्षिन् contends that the subtle elements produce their appropriate effects. The above view is not correct. It is because in the text &amp;rsquo;the teja-s and other subtle elements along with the soul merge in the Supreme deity, that is, Brahman&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.7 अविभागाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तेषां त्रयाणां तु परत्र पुंसि स्वकारणत्वात् प्रलयस्तु भावी ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तन्नैव पूर्वैः स्फुटमेकवाक्यात् संश्लेषमात्रं तदबाधतश्च ॥ 21 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.7 अविभागाधिकरणम् The prima faice view is : in the छान्दोग्य text it is stated that tejas along with the subtle elements and the soul merges in Brahman as Brahman is the cause of all. This merger is total absorption like the dissolution of the world. This contention is not correct. In the text cited above, the usage of word sampadyate is to be understood from the preceding statement which means that soul along with the subtle elements comes to be related to Brahman through a special kind of association. It is only in this manner we would maintain non - contradiction between the text cited above and the text-speech reaches the mind.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.8 तदोकोधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मूर्धाऽन्यनाडीभिरिति व्यवस्था न सौक्ष्म्यतः संभवशंसि वाक्यम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तन्नैव विद्यामहिमातिरेकात् परप्रसत्तेश्च तथैव यानम् ॥ 22 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.8 तदोकोधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the कठोपनिषद् text it is stated that the meditator while relinquishing the physical body which has hundred and one veins नाडी-s) passes through the artery in the crown of the head. Others depart through different veins. It is impossible to identify the artery crown of the head at the time of departure among several other veins as they are so subtle and hence there can be no specification in regard to the departure. This view is not correct. It is because the meditator can identify that particular vein (by which he would depart) by the result of meditation he had pursued before departure and by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Notes : 1.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.9 रश्म्यनुसाराधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;निशामृतौ रश्म्यनुसारवारणे नैव व्यवस्था किरणानुसारे ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न तद्व्यवस्थैव भवेन्निशीथेऽप्यौष्ण्योपलब्धेः यदमी हि सन्ति ॥ 23 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.9 रश्म्यनुसाराधिकरणम् It is argued that the view that the soul which practised meditation when it abandons the physical body, passes through the path of light is not correct. It is because when the soul abandons the physical body during night time, there is the absence of the ray of the Sun. This argument is wrong. Even when the soul departs at night, still he can travel through the rays of the sun as they are felt during the summer night and are present in winter too though it is not felt then being over-powered by snow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.10 निशाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;दिवा मृतस्यैव परोपसत्तिः विगर्हितत्वान्मरणस्य रात्रौ ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न स्यादिदं बन्धककर्महानात् विद्याबलात् तां वदति श्रुतिश्च ॥ 24 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.10 निशाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : only the soul which departs from the physical body during day time can attain the Supreme Brahman, as death at night is censured in the श्रुति text &amp;lsquo;Day - time, the bright fort - night and the northern course of the sun, these are favourable for those about to die; the contrary times are unfavourable&amp;rsquo;. This view is wrong. In the case of the one who meditates upon Brahman, the attainment of Brahman is established on the strength of the power of meditation although he may die at night. And the श्रुति text &amp;lsquo;For him the delay is only as long as he is not freed from the body, then he will be united&amp;rsquo; confirms the view that in the case of the knower of Brahman attainment of Brahman is established irrespective of his departure from this world either during day or night.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.2.11 दक्षिणायनाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मृतस्य मुक्तिर्न हि दक्षिणायने शशाङ्कसायुज्यं अमुष्य हि श्रुतम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न तत्तु विद्या महिमातिरेकतः श्रुतिस्तु सा विश्रमभूमिगोचरा ॥ 25 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.2.11 दक्षिणायनाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : he who dies during the southern course of the Sun, that is, दक्षिणायन is said to experience union with the presiding deity of the Moon. Hence attainment of Brahman is impossible in his case. This view is wrong. It is because on the strength of the meditation upon Brahman he who departs from this world during the southern course of the Sun does not come back to the world. The supplementary text of the same उपनिषद् states that from the world of Moon, he attains the glory of Brahman and it suggests that the world of the Moon is a place of rest for him.
