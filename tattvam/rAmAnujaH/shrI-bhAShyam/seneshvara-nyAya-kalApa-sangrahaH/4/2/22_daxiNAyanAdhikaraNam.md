4.2.11 दक्षिणायनाधिकरणम्  
मृतस्य मुक्तिर्न हि दक्षिणायने शशाङ्कसायुज्यं अमुष्य हि श्रुतम् ।  
न तत्तु विद्या महिमातिरेकतः श्रुतिस्तु सा विश्रमभूमिगोचरा ॥ 25 ॥

4.2.11 दक्षिणायनाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : he who dies during the southern course of the Sun, that is, दक्षिणायन is said to experience union with the presiding deity of the Moon. Hence attainment of Brahman is impossible in his case. This view is wrong. It is because on the strength of the meditation upon Brahman he who departs from this world during the southern course of the Sun does not come back to the world. The supplementary text of the same उपनिषद् states that from the world of Moon, he attains the glory of Brahman and it suggests that the world of the Moon is a place of rest for him. Notes : 1. महानारायणोपनिषद् DDV.1. 2. महानारायणोपनिषद् DDV.1.
