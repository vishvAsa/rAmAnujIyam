4.2.9 रश्म्यनुसाराधिकरणम् It is argued that the view that the soul which practised meditation when it abandons the physical body, passes through the path of light is not correct. It is because when the soul abandons the physical body during night time, there is the absence of the ray of the Sun. This argument is wrong. Even when the soul departs at night, still he can travel through the rays of the sun as they are felt during the summer night and are present in winter too though it is not felt then being over-powered by snow.
