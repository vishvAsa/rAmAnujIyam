4.2.7 अविभागाधिकरणम्  
तेषां त्रयाणां तु परत्र पुंसि स्वकारणत्वात् प्रलयस्तु भावी ।  
तन्नैव पूर्वैः स्फुटमेकवाक्यात् संश्लेषमात्रं तदबाधतश्च ॥ 21 ॥

4.2.7 अविभागाधिकरणम् The prima faice view is : in the छान्दोग्य text it is stated that tejas along with the subtle elements and the soul merges in Brahman as Brahman is the cause of all. This merger is total absorption like the dissolution of the world. This contention is not correct. In the text cited above, the usage of word sampadyate is to be understood from the preceding statement which means that soul along with the subtle elements comes to be related to Brahman through a special kind of association. It is only in this manner we would maintain non - contradiction between the text cited above and the text-speech reaches the mind. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.6. 2. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.6.
