4.2.8 तदोकोधिकरणम्  
मूर्धाऽन्यनाडीभिरिति व्यवस्था न सौक्ष्म्यतः संभवशंसि वाक्यम् ।  
तन्नैव विद्यामहिमातिरेकात् परप्रसत्तेश्च तथैव यानम् ॥ 22 ॥

4.2.8 तदोकोधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the कठोपनिषद् text it is stated that the meditator while relinquishing the physical body which has hundred and one veins नाडी-s) passes through the artery in the crown of the head. Others depart through different veins. It is impossible to identify the artery crown of the head at the time of departure among several other veins as they are so subtle and hence there can be no specification in regard to the departure. This view is not correct. It is because the meditator can identify that particular vein (by which he would depart) by the result of meditation he had pursued before departure and by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Notes : 1. II.vi.16.
