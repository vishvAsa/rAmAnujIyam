4.2.2 मनोधिकरणम्  
प्राणोऽम्बु तेजः प्रकृतित्वयोगात् 'आपोमयः प्राणः' इति श्रुतेश्च ।  
न स्यादहङ्कारकृतं तु चित्तं प्राणो नभः कार्यमतः स एव ॥ 16 ॥

4.2.2 मनोधिकरणम् The पूर्वपक्ष view is : the प्राण is identical with water. Like water it too has tejas as its causal substance. Further there is the उपनिषदिc text - प्राण consists of water'. From this it is known that प्राण has water as its causal substance. Mind is stated to be having food as its causal substance, and food is stated to be having waters as its causal substance. Thus when it is said that mind undergoes association with प्राण we have to understand by the word प्राण the waters which constitute the causal substance of प्राण And with waters mind becomes associated. This means mind is absolved in प्राण - its cause (that is waters) in an indirect way. The above view is wrong. When it is said that mind consists of earth and प्राण consists of water what is meant is that mind and प्राण are nourished through food and water. It does not mean that food and water are causal substances of mind and प्राण Further mind is derived from अहङ्कार the principle of egotism and प्राण is the modification of ether.
