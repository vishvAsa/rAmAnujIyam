तेजस्तु 'तत्तेज' इति श्रुतत्वात् तन्मात्रमेवान्यवियुक्तरूपम् ।  
न स्यात् तु भूतान्तरसंप्रविष्टं त्रिवृत्कृतत्व श्रवणादशक्तेः ॥ 18 ॥

4.2.4 भूताधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the text प्राण reaches the fire it is stated that प्राण reaches only fire. This view is not correct. it is because according to triplication theory earth, water and fire are combined with one another and so each one of these consists of the other two elements. Hence प्राण reaches the fire associated with other elements too. It is to be noted that each element individualy is not capable of producing any effect. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.6.
