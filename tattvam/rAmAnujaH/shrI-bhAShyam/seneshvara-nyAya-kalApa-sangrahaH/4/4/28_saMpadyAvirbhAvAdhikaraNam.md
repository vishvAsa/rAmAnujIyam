4.4.1 संपद्याविर्भावाधिकरणम्  
नित्योपलब्धेरसुखत्वतश्च केनापि रूपेण सुखैकभाजा ।  
मुक्तस्य संबन्ध इति त्वसत् स्यात् स्वेनेति शब्दात् अतिरोहितत्वात् ॥ 36 ॥

4.4.1 संपद्याविर्भावाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the released soul on approaching the Supreme Brahman associates himself with some form blissful in nature. This view is wrong. It is because the छान्दोग्य text states that the soul attains the Supreme Brahman and appears in his own true form. And here in the state of transmigratory existence the true form of the soul is concealed and in the state of liberation it is manifested. Notes : 1. VIII.xii.1.
