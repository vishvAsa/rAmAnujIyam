4.4.3 ब्राह्माधिकरणम्  
मुक्तस्वरूपं तु गुणाष्टकं स्यात् तथा श्रुतत्वात् द्युतिमात्रता वा ।  
तस्यैव विज्ञानघनत्वशब्दात् तन्नोभयं स्यात् उभयाविरोधात् ॥ 38 ॥

4.4.3 ब्राह्माधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the essential nature of the self that has attained Brahman consists of eight qualities mentioned in the छान्दोग्योपनिषद् beginning with freedom from sin and ending with having will that is true. Or the self shall remain as more consciousness on the basis of the बृहदारण्यक text which refers to the released soul as a mass of consciousness The above contention does not hold good. It is because the released soul whose essential nature is consciousness remains as consciousness and on the authority of the छान्दोग्य text cited above it remains as endowed with attributes like freedom from sin etc. Notes : 1. VIII.vii.1. 2. IV.v.13.
