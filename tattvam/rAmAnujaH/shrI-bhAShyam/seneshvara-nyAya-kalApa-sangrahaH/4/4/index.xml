      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.1 संपद्याविर्भावाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नित्योपलब्धेरसुखत्वतश्च केनापि रूपेण सुखैकभाजा ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुक्तस्य संबन्ध इति त्वसत् स्यात् स्वेनेति शब्दात् अतिरोहितत्वात् ॥ 36 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.1 संपद्याविर्भावाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the released soul on approaching the Supreme Brahman associates himself with some form blissful in nature. This view is wrong. It is because the छान्दोग्य text states that the soul attains the Supreme Brahman and appears in his own true form. And here in the state of transmigratory existence the true form of the soul is concealed and in the state of liberation it is manifested. Notes : 1. VIII.xii.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.2 अविभागेनदृष्टत्वाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;परानुभूतिस्तु विभेदतः स्यात् साधर्म्यशब्दादतिसाम्यशब्दात् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;न स्यादिदं नाम तदात्मकत्वात् साम्यश्रुतिस्तद्गुणसाम्यलम्बा ॥ 37 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.2 अविभागेनदृष्टत्वाधिकरणम् The पूर्वपक्ष contention is the soul that has reached Brahman has similarity with Him and is closely connected with Him. The तैत्तिरीय text states that the released soul attains all the attributes of Brahman. Thus in spite of close relation the soul could feel that he is separate from Brahman. This contention can not hold good. The texts like &amp;lsquo;That Thou Art&amp;rsquo;, etc., speak of the released soul as experiencing its own self as inseperable from Brahman. The text that speak of similarity between the soul and Brahman must be understood in the sense that the released soul has become God - like. The तैत्तिरीय text cited above refers to the fact that the soul experiences Brahman of which he is the mode. Notes : 1. II.i.1. 2. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.7.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.3 ब्राह्माधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुक्तस्वरूपं तु गुणाष्टकं स्यात् तथा श्रुतत्वात् द्युतिमात्रता वा ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;तस्यैव विज्ञानघनत्वशब्दात् तन्नोभयं स्यात् उभयाविरोधात् ॥ 38 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.3 ब्राह्माधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the essential nature of the self that has attained Brahman consists of eight qualities mentioned in the छान्दोग्योपनिषद् beginning with freedom from sin and ending with having will that is true. Or the self shall remain as more consciousness on the basis of the बृहदारण्यक text which refers to the released soul as a mass of consciousness The above contention does not hold good. It is because the released soul whose essential nature is consciousness remains as consciousness and on the authority of the छान्दोग्य text cited above it remains as endowed with attributes like freedom from sin etc. Notes : 1. VIII.vii.1. 2. IV.v.13.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.4 संकल्पाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुक्तस्य पित्रादि तु सप्रयत्नात् सङ्कल्पतो भावि तथैव दृष्टेः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ब्रह्मादिकेष्वित्यसदेतत् एषां सङ्कल्पसत्यत्ववियोगतः स्यात् ॥ 39 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.4 संकल्पाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the released soul in order to have the vision of his manes must have some effort because we see even in the case Brahma and the like their wishes are realised by will only by depending upon other efforts. This view is not correct. The छान्दोग्य text which states &amp;lsquo;out of his will manes arise&amp;rsquo; does not specify the need of any other effort. Otherwise there will arise the contradition to the view. The mere will of the released soul would bring forth the manes before him. Notes : 1. VIII.ii.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.5 अभावाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुक्तोऽशरीरस्त्वशरीरशब्दात् इच्छाशरीरी &amp;lsquo;बहुधा&amp;rsquo; इति शब्दात् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैषा व्यवस्था &amp;lsquo;बहुधा&amp;rsquo; तु शब्दात् बहुश्रुतेश्च त्वयमैच्छिकः स्यात् ॥ 40 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.5 अभावाधिकरणम् The question arises as to whether the released soul remains free from body or without a body, since the छान्दोग्य text states that pleasure and pain do not touch him when he is free from the body. It is known that the released soul remain without a body. Since the same text in another context states that the released soul remains as one or three fold or five fold or seven fold, it is known that the released soul is associated with a body which he has taken out of his own will. The conclusive view is that there is no fixed position that the released soul must remain in either of the two forms. He could exist in two ways : with or without the body. On the basis of the two texts cited above by his own will the released soul can remain with or without the body. Notes : 1. VIII.xii.1. 2. VII.xxvi.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;4.4.6 जगद्व्यापारवर्जाधिकरणम्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;मुक्तस्य भोगः खलु साम्यशब्दात् निर्वोढृता स्यात् भुवनस्य तद्वत् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;नैतत् परस्यैव तथात्वशब्दात् भोगोनुभूतिः सगुणस्य तस्य ॥ 41 ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;टीका&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.4.6 जगद्व्यापारवर्जाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the released soul is stated in the मुण्डक text as attaining highest equality with Brahman. This means that he has cosmic control like Brahman. This view is wrong. On the basis of the तैत्तिरीय text it is noticed that the control of the entire Universe is the exclusive attribute of Brahman. And on the basis of the तैत्तिरीय text &amp;lsquo;he obtains all the auspicious attributes together with the Omniscient Brahman&amp;rsquo; it must be held that the equality of the soul with Brahman is in respect of mere enjoyment. Notes : 1. III.i.3. 2. II.viii.1. 3. II.i.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
