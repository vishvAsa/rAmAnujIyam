मुक्तस्य पित्रादि तु सप्रयत्नात् सङ्कल्पतो भावि तथैव दृष्टेः ।  
ब्रह्मादिकेष्वित्यसदेतत् एषां सङ्कल्पसत्यत्ववियोगतः स्यात् ॥ 39 ॥

4.4.4 संकल्पाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the released soul in order to have the vision of his manes must have some effort because we see even in the case Brahma and the like their wishes are realised by will only by depending upon other efforts. This view is not correct. The छान्दोग्य text which states 'out of his will manes arise' does not specify the need of any other effort. Otherwise there will arise the contradition to the view. The mere will of the released soul would bring forth the manes before him. Notes : 1. VIII.ii.1.
