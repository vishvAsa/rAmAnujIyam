4.4.2 अविभागेनदृष्टत्वाधिकरणम् The पूर्वपक्ष contention is the soul that has reached Brahman has similarity with Him and is closely connected with Him. The तैत्तिरीय text states that the released soul attains all the attributes of Brahman. Thus in spite of close relation the soul could feel that he is separate from Brahman. This contention can not hold good. The texts like 'That Thou Art', etc., speak of the released soul as experiencing its own self as inseperable from Brahman. The text that speak of similarity between the soul and Brahman must be understood in the sense that the released soul has become God - like. The तैत्तिरीय text cited above refers to the fact that the soul experiences Brahman of which he is the mode. Notes : 1. II.i.1. 2. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.7.
