4.3.1 अर्चिराद्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the scriptures give different versions of the path through which the one who meditates upon Brahman reaches Brahman. The छान्दोग्य states that the one who meditates upon Brahman goes through the ray of the Sun. The कौषीतकिन्-s say that such a one comes to the world of Agni. The बृहदारण्यक states that such a person goes to वायु Thus these texts refer to different paths. There is no restriction that one goes through the path beginning with light. The above view is wrong. It is because all the texts invariably mention the path of light. Hence one goes through the path beginning with light. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VIII.vi.5. 2. कौष् Up., II.i.3. 3. VII.x.1.
