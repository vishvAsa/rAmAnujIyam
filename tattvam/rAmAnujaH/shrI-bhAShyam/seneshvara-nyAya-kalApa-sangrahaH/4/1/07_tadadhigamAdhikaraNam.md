4.1.7 तदधिगमाधिकरणम्  
'नाभुक्तं' इत्येव तु संस्मृतत्वात् अश्लेषनाशौ न हि पातकानाम् ।  
तस्याः फलित्वैकसमर्थनत्वात् 'एवं विदी'ति श्रवणाच्च नैवम् ॥ 7 ॥

4.1.7 तदधिगमाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : on the authority of the text of the Brahma - vaivarta - पुराण namely आइथोउत् experiencing its results no action would get annihilated even after millions of years', it must be held that there can be no destruction of karma or the karma will become inefficacious due to meditation. On the other hand they would give forth their fruits. It is not correct to hold such a view because the छान्दोग्य text clearly states that just as water does not stick to the lotus leaf, so also the sins do not cling the one who is devoted to meditation. The पुराण passage cited above is only with reference to those who do not pursue meditation and so there is no contradiction. Notes : 1. प्रकृति खण्ड XXVI.70 2. IV.xiv.3.
