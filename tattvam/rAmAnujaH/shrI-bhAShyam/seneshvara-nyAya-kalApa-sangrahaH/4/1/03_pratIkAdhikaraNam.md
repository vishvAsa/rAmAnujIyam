तथा प्रतीकेषु यथेतरेषु यस्मात् परोपासनताऽविशिष्टा ।  
तन्नैव शंक्यं, परमात्मदृष्ट्या नामादिकानां समुपास्यभावात् ॥ 3 ॥

4.1.3 प्रतीकाधिकरणम् There arises the doubt whether mind which is spoken of as a symbol of Brahman, may be meditated upon as the self of the soul as in the case of other meditations. This doubt is dispelled by stating that symbols such as mind, etc., can not be the self of the soul. Notes : 1. Symbolic meditation is that in which what is not Brahman is contemplated as Brahman. 2. Mind must be meditated as Brahman. छान्द्. उप् III.xviii.1.
