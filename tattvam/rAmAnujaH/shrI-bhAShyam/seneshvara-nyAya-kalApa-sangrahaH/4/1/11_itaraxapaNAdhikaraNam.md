4.1.11 इतरक्षपणाधिकरणम्  
'यावन्न मोक्ष्ये'ति विशेषशब्दात् आरभ्यमाणस्य फलं च कर्म ।  
तद्देहपातावधिकं न चैतत् तस्याः श्रुतेः तत्फलगोचरत्वात् ॥ 11 ॥

4.1.11 इतरक्षपणाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : on the basis of the text 'For Him there is delay only as long as he is not freed from the body', the fructified deeds function till the end of the present body. It is wrong. It is because there is no fixing of any limit for the bodily existences as long as all karma-s which have begun to yield fruits have not been exhausted. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., Vi.xiv.2.
