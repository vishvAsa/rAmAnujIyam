4.1.10 अग्निहोत्राद्यधिकरणम्  
अश्लेषनाशश्रवणात् कृतानां अकार्यता स्वाश्रमकर्मणां च ।  
नैतत्तु कार्यं खलु 'यज्ञ'शब्दात् विद्यासमुत्पादनशक्तितश्च ॥ 10 ॥

4.1.10 अग्निहोत्राद्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : since there are texts that proclaim that the results of the deeds performed prior to the attainment of the mature state of meditation will be destroyed and of those performed after the attainment of the above state will not cling to the soul, one need not perform any ritual - act relating to one`s stage and class of life. This is not correct. On the basis of the श्रुति text : 'Men of spiritual birth seek to realize Brahman by the study of the Veda-s and by the performance of sacrifices, etc.,' and on the basis of the inherent strength of actions to make meditation perfect, one must perform one`s allotted duties.
