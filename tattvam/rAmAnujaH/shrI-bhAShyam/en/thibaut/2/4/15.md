15. They, with the exception of the best, are organs, on account of being so designated.

Are all principles called prāṇas to be considered as 'organs' (indriyāṇi), or is the 'best,' i.e. the chief prāṇa, to be excepted?--All of them, without exception, are organs; for they all are called prāṇas equally, and they all are instruments of the soul.--Not so, the Sūtra replies. The 'best' one is to be excepted, since only the prawas other than the best are designated as organs. Texts such as 'the organs are ten and one' (Bha. Gī. XIII, 5) apply the term 'organ' only to the senses of sight and the rest, and the internal organ.
