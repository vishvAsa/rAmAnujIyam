14. And on account of the eternity of this.

As the quality, inhering in all things, of being ruled by the highest Self, is eternal and definitely fixed by being connected with his essential nature, it is an unavoidable conclusion that the rule of the soul and of the divinities over the organs depends on the will of the highest Self. The text, 'Having sent forth this he entered into it, having entered into it he became sat and tyat' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), shows that the entering on the part of the highest Person

into all things, so as to be their ruler, is connected with his essential nature. Similarly Smr̥ti says, 'Pervading this entire Universe by a portion of mine I do abide' (Bha. Gī. X, 42).--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the rule of Fire and the rest.'
