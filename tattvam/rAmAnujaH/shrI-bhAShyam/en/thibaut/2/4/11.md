11. It is designated as having five functions like mind.

As desire, and so on, are not principles different from mind, although they are different functions and produce different effects--according to the text, 'Desire, purpose, doubt, faith, want of faith, firmness, absence of firmness, shame, reflection, fear--all this is mind' (Br̥. Up. I,,5, 3); so, on the ground of the text, 'prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, samāna--all this is prāṇa' (ibid.), apāna and the rest must be held to be different functions of prāṇa only, not independent principles.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of what is 'a modification of air.'
