12. And (it is) minute.

This prāṇa also is minute, since as before (i.e. as in the case of the organs) the text declares it to pass out of the body, to move, and so on, 'him when he passes out the prāṇa follows after' (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2). A further doubt arises, in the case of prāṇa, owing to the fact that in other texts it is spoken of as of large extent, 'It is equal to these three worlds, equal to this Universe' (Br̥. Up. I, 3, 22); 'On prāṇa everything is founded'; 'For all this is shut up in prāṇa.' But as the texts declaring the passing out, and so on, of the prāṇa, prove it to be of limited size, the all-embracingness ascribed to prāṇa in those other texts must be interpreted to mean only that the life of all living and breathing creatures depends on breath.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the minuteness of the best.'
