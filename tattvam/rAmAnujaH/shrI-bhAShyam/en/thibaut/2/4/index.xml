      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fourth-pāda&#34;&gt;FOURTH PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus the prāṇas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After having taught that Ether and all the other elements are effects, and hence have originated, the Sūtras had shown that the individual soul, although likewise an effect, does not originate in the sense of undergoing a change of essential nature; and had in connexion therewith clearly set forth wherein the essential nature of the soul consists. They now proceed to elucidate the question as to the origination of the instruments of the individual soul, viz. the organs and the vital breath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For Scripture&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;declares that previous to creation the highest Self only exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Speech, i.e. the names which have for their object all things apart from Brahman, presupposes the existence of the entire universe of things&amp;ndash;ether, and so on&amp;ndash;which is the object of speech. But, as according to the text &amp;rsquo;this was then non-differentiated; it was thereupon differentiated by names and forms,&amp;rsquo; then (i.e. before the differentiation of individual things), no things having name and form existed, there existed also no effects of speech and the other organs of action and sensation, and hence it cannot be inferred that those organs themselves existed.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the origination of the prāṇas.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. II, 1, 8)&amp;ndash;where the repetition &amp;lsquo;seven and seven&amp;rsquo; intimates the plurality of souls to which the prāṇas are attached. Moreover those moving prāṇas are distinctly specified in the following text, &amp;lsquo;when the five instruments of knowledge stand still, together with the mind (manas), and when the buddhi does not move, that they call the highest &amp;ldquo;going&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; (gati&amp;ndash;Ka. Up. II, 6, 10). The &amp;lsquo;highest going&amp;rsquo; here means the moving towards Release, all movement within the body having&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hence (it is) not so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The organs are not seven only, but eleven, since the hands and the rest also contribute towards the experience and fruition of that which abides in the body, i.e. the soul, and have their separate offices, such as seizing, and so on. Hence it is not so, i.e. it must not be thought that the hands and the rest are not organs. Buddhi, ahankāra and citta, on the other hand, are(not independent organs but) mere designations of the manas, according as the latter is engaged in the functions of deciding (adhyavasāya), or misconception (abhimāna, or thinking (cintā). The organs therefore are eleven. From this it follows that in the passage &amp;lsquo;Ten are these prāṇas in man, and Ātman is the eleventh&amp;rsquo;(Br̥. Up. II, 4, ii), the word Ātman denotes the manas. The number &lt;em&gt;eleven&lt;/em&gt; is confirmed by scriptural and Smr̥ti passages, cp. &amp;rsquo;the ten organs and the one&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XIII, 5); &amp;rsquo;ten are the vaikārika beings, the manas is the eleventh,&amp;rsquo; and others. Where more organs&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And (they are) minute.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the text &amp;rsquo;these are all alike, all infinite&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 5, 13), declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the prāṇas are all-pervading.&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies, that they are minute; for the text &amp;lsquo;when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the prāṇas pass out after it&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those prāṇas to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size&amp;ndash;The text which speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation (&amp;lsquo;he who meditates on them as infinite&amp;rsquo;), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute of the prāṇa to be meditated on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And the best.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By &amp;rsquo;the best&amp;rsquo; we have to understand the chief vital air (mukhya prāṇa), which, in the colloquy of the prāṇas, is determined to be the best because it is the cause of the preservation of the body. This chief vital air the Pūrvapakshin maintains to be something non-created, since Scripture (R̥. Saṁh. V, 129, 2), &amp;lsquo;By its own law the One was breathing without wind,&amp;rsquo; shows that an effect of it, viz. the act of breathing, existed even previously to creation, at the time of a great pralaya; and because texts declaring it to have been created&amp;ndash;such as &amp;lsquo;from him is born breath&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3)&amp;ndash;may be interpreted in the same way as the texts declaring that the soul is something created (sec p. 540 ff.).&amp;ndash;To this the reply is that, since this view contradicts scriptural statements as to the oneness of all, previous to creation; and since the Muṇḍaka-text declares the prāṇa to have been created in the same way as earth and the other elements; and since there are no texts plainly denying its createdness, the chief vital air also must&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neither air nor function, on account of its being stated separately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this main vital breath nothing else but air, the second of the elements? Or is it a certain motion of the air? Or is it air that has assumed some special condition?&amp;ndash;The first alternative may be adopted, on account of the text &amp;lsquo;prāṇa is air.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Or, since mere air is not called breath, while this term is generally applied to that motion of air which consists in inhalation and exhalation, we may hold that breath is a motion of air.&amp;ndash;Of both these views the Sūtra disposes by declaring &amp;rsquo;not so, on account of separate statement.&amp;rsquo; For in the passage &amp;lsquo;From him there is produced breath,mind,and all sense-organs,ether and air,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c, breath and air are mentioned as two separate things. For the same reason breath also cannot be a mere motion or function of air; for the text does not mention any functions of fire and the other elements, side by side with these elements, as separate things (and this shows that breath also cannot, in that text, be interpreted to denote a function of air). The text &amp;lsquo;prāṇa is air,&amp;rsquo; on the other hand, intimates (not that breath is identical with air. but) that breath is air having assumed a special form, not a thing altogether different from it, like fire. In ordinary language, moreover, the word &lt;em&gt;breath&lt;/em&gt; does not mean a mere motion but a substance to which motion belongs; we say,&amp;rsquo;the breath moves to and fro in inhalation and exhalation.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But like the eye and the rest, on account of being taught with them, and for other reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breath is not an element, but like sight and the rest, a special instrument of the soul. This appears from the fact that the texts mention it together with the recognised organs of the soul, the eye, and so on; so e.g. in the colloquy of the prāṇas. And such common mention is suitable in the case of such things only as belong to one class.&amp;ndash;The &amp;lsquo;and for other reasons&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra refers to the circumstance of the principal breath being specially mentioned among the organs comprised under the term &amp;lsquo;prāṇa&amp;rsquo;; cp. &amp;rsquo;that principal breath&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. I, 2, 7); &amp;rsquo;that central breath&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 5, 21).&amp;ndash;But if the chief breath is, like the eye and the other organs, an instrument of the soul, there must be some special form of activity through which it assists the soul, as the eye e.g. assists the soul by seeing. But no such activity is perceived, and the breath cannot therefore be put in the same category as the organs of sensation and action!&amp;ndash;To this objection the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And there is no objection on account of its not having an activity (karaṇa); for (Scripture) thus declares.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The karaṇa of the Sūtra means kriyā, action. The objection raised on the ground that the principal breath does not exercise any form of activity helpful to the soul, is without force, since as a matter of fact Scripture declares that there is such an activity, in so far as the vital breath supports the body with all its organs. For the text (Cḥ. Up. V, 1, 7 ff.) relates how on the successive departure of speech, and so on, the body and the other organs maintained their strength, while on the departure of the vital breath the body and all the organs at once became weak and powerless.&amp;ndash;The conclusion therefore is that the breath, in its fivefold form of prāṇa, apāna, and so on, subserves the purposes of the individual soul, and thus occupies the position of an instrument, no less than the eye and the other organs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. I,,5, 3); so, on the ground of the text, &amp;lsquo;prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, samāna&amp;ndash;all this is prāṇa&amp;rsquo; (ibid.), apāna and the rest must be held to be different functions of prāṇa only, not independent principles.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of what is &amp;lsquo;a modification of air.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. V, 4, 2). A further doubt arises, in the case of prāṇa, owing to the fact that in other texts it is spoken of as of large extent, &amp;lsquo;It is equal to these three worlds, equal to this Universe&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 3, 22); &amp;lsquo;On prāṇa everything is founded&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;For all this is shut up in prāṇa.&amp;rsquo; But as the texts declaring the passing out, and so on, of the prāṇa, prove it to be of limited size, the all-embracingness ascribed to prāṇa in those other texts must be interpreted to mean only that the life of all living and breathing creatures depends on breath.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the minuteness of the best.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the rule (over the prāṇas) on the part of Fire and the rest, together with him to whom the prāṇa belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to the thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of scriptural statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that the prāṇas, together with the main prāṇa, originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the prāṇas are guided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a previous occasion, viz. under Sū. II, 1, 5. And it is known from ordinary experience that the organs are ruled by the individual soul, which uses them as means of experience and fruition. And this is also established by scriptural texts, such as &amp;lsquo;Having taken these prāṇas he (i.e. the soul) moves about in his own body, according to his pleasure&amp;rsquo;(Br̥. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now arises whether the rule of the soul and of the presiding divine beings over the prāṇas depends on them (i.e. the soul and the divinities) only, or on some other being.&amp;ndash;On them only, since they depend on no one else!&amp;ndash;Not so, the Sūtra declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. Agni and the other divinities, together with him to whom the prāṇas belong i.e. the soul, exercise over the prāṇas, proceeds from the thinking of that, i.e. from the will of the highest Self.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;From scriptural statement.&amp;rsquo; For Scripture teaches that the organs, together with their guiding divinities and the individual soul, depend in all their doings on the thought of the highest Person. &amp;lsquo;He, who abiding within Fire, rules Fire from within.&amp;ndash;He, who abiding within the air&amp;ndash;within the Self&amp;ndash;within the eye, and so on&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up III, 7); &amp;lsquo;From fear of it the wind blows, from fear of it the sun rises, from fear of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); &amp;lsquo;By the command of that Imperishable one, sun and moon stand, held apart&amp;rsquo;(Br̥ Up III, 8, 9).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The text, &amp;lsquo;Having sent forth this he entered into it, having entered into it he became sat and tyat&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 6), shows that the entering on the part of the highest Person&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; one is to be excepted, since only the prawas other than the best are designated as organs. Texts such as &amp;rsquo;the organs are ten and one&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of scriptural statement of difference, and on account of difference of characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Texts such as &amp;lsquo;from him is born prāṇa, and the internal organ, and all organs&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) mention the vital breath separately from the organs, and this shows that the breath is not one of the organs. The passage indeed mentions the internal organ (manas) also as something separate; but in other passages the manas is formally included in the organs, &amp;rsquo;the (five) organs with mind as the sixth&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XV, 7). That the vital breath differs in nature from the organ of sight and the rest, is a matter of observation. For in the state of deep sleep the function of breath is seen to continue, while those of the eye, and so on, are not perceived. The work of the organs, inclusive of the manas, is to act as instruments of cognition and action, while the work of breath is to maintain the body and the organs. It is for the reason that the subsistence of the organs depends on breath, that the organs themselves are called prāṇas. Thus Scripture says, &amp;rsquo;they all became the form of that (breath), and therefore they are called after him prāṇas&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 5, 21). &amp;lsquo;They became&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders tripartite, on account of scriptural teaching.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras have shown that the creation of the elements and organs in their collective aspect (samashṭi) and the activity of the individual souls proceed from the highest Self; and they have also further confirmed the view that the rule which the souls exercise over their organs depends on the highest Self. A question now arises with regard to the creation of the world in its discrete aspect (vyashṭi), which consists in the differentiation of names and forms (i.e. of individual beings). Is this latter creation the work of Hiraṇyagarbha only, who represents the collective aggregate of all individual souls; or, fundamentally, the work of the highest Brahman having Hiraṇyagarbha for its body&amp;ndash;just as the creation of water e.g. is the work of the highest Brahman having sire for its body?&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, the text &amp;lsquo;Having entered with this living-soul-self (anena jīvenāt-manā), let me differentiate names and forms&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 3, 2), declares the jīva-soul to be the agent in differentiation. For the resolve of the highest deity is expressed, not in the form &amp;rsquo;let me differentiate names and forms by myself (svena rūpeṇa), but &amp;lsquo;by this soul-self,&amp;rsquo; i.e. by a part of the highest Self, in the form of the individual soul.&amp;ndash;But on this interpretation the first person in &amp;lsquo;vyākaravāṇi&amp;rsquo; (let me enter), and the grammatical form of &amp;lsquo;having entered,&amp;rsquo; which indicates the agent, could not be taken in their literal, but only in an implied, sense&amp;ndash;as is the case in a sentence such as &amp;lsquo;Having entered the hostile army by means of a spy, I will estimate its strength&amp;rsquo; (where the real agent is not the king, who is the speaker, but the spy).&amp;ndash;The cases are not analogous, the Pūrvapakshin replies. For the king and the spy are fundamentally separate, and hence the king is agent by implication only. But in the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flesh is of earthy nature; in the case of the two others also according to the text.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view that the description of tripartition, given in the passage &amp;rsquo;each of these he made tripartite,&amp;rsquo; refers to a time subsequent to the creation of the mundane egg and to the gods created by Brahmā, cannot be upheld. For from it there would follow that, as in the passage &amp;rsquo;earth when eaten is disposed of in three ways,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., flesh is declared to be more subtle than feces, and mind yet subtler, it would have to be assumed&amp;ndash;in agreement with the nature of the causal substance&amp;ndash;that flesh is made of water and manas of fire &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And similarly we should have to assume that urine&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But on account of their distinctive nature there is that designation, that designation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each element indeed is of a threefold nature, owing to the primary tripartition; but as in each mixed element one definite element prevails&amp;ndash;so that each element has a distinctive character of its own&amp;ndash;a definite designation is given to each.&amp;ndash;The repetition (of &amp;rsquo;that designation&amp;rsquo;) in the Sūtra indicates the completion of the adhyāya.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the fashioning of names and forms.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
