6. And (they are) minute.

As the text 'these are all alike, all infinite' (Br̥. Up. I, 5, 13), declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the prāṇas are all-pervading.--To this the Sūtra replies, that they are minute; for the text 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the prāṇas pass out after it' (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those prāṇas to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size--The text which speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation ('he who meditates on them as infinite'), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute of the prāṇa to be meditated on.
