8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.

Even if it were admitted that the Pradhāna is established by Inference, the Sānkhya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradhāna is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, 'In order that the soul may know the Pradhāna and become isolated' (Sānkhya Kā. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhāna is fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible. For, as the soul consists of pure intelligence, is inactive, changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable neither of fruition which consists in consciousness of Prakr̥ti, nor of Release which consists in separation from Prakr̥ti. If, on the other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described is, owing to the mere nearness of Prakr̥ti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prakr̥ti, it follows that, as Prakr̥ti is ever near, the soul will never accomplish emancipation.
