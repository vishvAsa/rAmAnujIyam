6. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal (and subordinate) matter.

You Sānkhyas maintain that the origination of the world results from a certain relation between principal and subordinate entities which depends on the relative inferiority

and superiority of the guṇas--'according to the difference of the abodes of the several guṇas' (Sānkhya Kā. I, 16).

But, as in the pralaya state the three guṇas are in a state of equipoise, none of them being superior or inferior to the others, that relation of superiority and subordination cannot then exist, and hence the world cannot originate. Should it, on the other hand, be maintained that even in the pralaya state there is a certain inequality, it would follow therefrom that creation is eternal.
