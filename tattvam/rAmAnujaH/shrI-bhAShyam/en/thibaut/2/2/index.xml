      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;second-pāda&#34;&gt;SECOND PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not that which is inferred, on account of the impossibility of construction, and on account of activity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras have so far set forth the doctrine that the highest Brahman is the cause of the origination and so on of the world, and have refuted the objections raised by others. They now, in order to safeguard their own position, proceed to demolish the positions held by those very adversaries. For otherwise it might happen that some slow-witted persons, unaware of those other views resting on mere fallacious arguments, would imagine them possibly to be authoritative, and hence might be somewhat shaken in their belief in the Vedic doctrine. Another pāda therefore is begun to the express end of refuting the theories of others. The beginning is made with the theory of Kapila, because that theory has several features, such as the view of the existence of the effect in the cause, which are approved of by the followers of the Veda, and hence is more likely, than others, to give rise to the erroneous view of its being the true doctrine. The Sūtras I, 1, 5 and ff. have proved only that the Vedic texts do not set forth the Sānkhya view, while the task of the present pāda is to demolish that view itself: the Sūtras cannot therefore be charged with needless reiteration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said&amp;ndash;like milk or water; there also (intelligence guides).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has been said&amp;ndash;the Sānkhya rejoins&amp;ndash;as to the impossibility of the Pradhāna not guided by an intelligent principle constructing this variously constituted world, is unfounded; for the Pradhāna may be supposed to act in the same way as milk and water do. Milk, when turning into sour milk, is capable of going by itself through a series of changes: it does not therefore depend on anything else. In the same way we observe that the homogeneous water discharged from the clouds spontaneously proceeds to transform itself into the various saps and juices of different plants, such as palm trees, mango trees, wood-apple trees, lime trees, tamarind trees, and so on. In the same way the Pradhāna, of whose essential nature it is to change, may, without being guided by another agent, abide in the interval&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nor can the Sānkhya retort that our view gives rise to similar difficulties in so far, namely, as the Lord, all whose wishes are eternally accomplished, who is free from all imperfection, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c., cannot be the originator of either creation or pralaya, and as the creation of an unequal world would lay him open to the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But nothing of the kind takes place, and hence we conclude that it is the intelligent principle only which turns the grass eaten by the cow into milk.&amp;ndash;This point has been set forth above under Sūtra 3; the present Sūtra is meant to emphasise and particularise it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And if you say&amp;ndash;as the man and the stone; thus also.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here the following view might be urged. Although the soul consists of mere intelligence and is inactive, while the Pradhāna is destitute of all power of thought; yet the non-sentient Pradhāna may begin to act owing to the mere nearness of the soul. For we observe parallel instances. A man blind but capable of motion may act in some way, owing to the nearness to him of some lame man who has no power of motion but possesses good eyesight and assists the blind man with his intelligence. And through the nearness of the magnetic stone iron moves. In the same way the creation of the world may result from the connexion of Prakr̥ti and the soul. As has been said, &amp;lsquo;In order that the soul may know the Pradhāna and become isolated, the connexion of the two takes place like that of the lame and the blind; and thence creation springs&amp;rsquo; (Sānkhya Kā. 21). This means&amp;ndash;to the end that the soul may experience the Pradhāna, and for the sake of the soul&amp;rsquo;s emancipation, the Pradhāna enters on action at the beginning of creation, owing to the nearness of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal (and subordinate) matter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You Sānkhyas maintain that the origination of the world results from a certain relation between principal and subordinate entities which depends on the relative inferiority&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and superiority of the guṇas&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;according to the difference of the abodes of the several guṇas&amp;rsquo; (Sānkhya Kā. I, 16).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, as in the pralaya state the three guṇas are in a state of equipoise, none of them being superior or inferior to the others, that relation of superiority and subordination cannot then exist, and hence the world cannot originate. Should it, on the other hand, be maintained that even in the pralaya state there is a certain inequality, it would follow therefrom that creation is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And if another inference be made (the result remains unchanged), on account of (the Pradhāna) being destitute of the power of a knowing subject.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the Pradhāna were inferred by some reasoning different from the arguments so far refuted by us, our objections would remain in force because, anyhow, the Pradhāna is devoid of the power of a cognising subject. The Pradhāna thus cannot be established by any mode of inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if it were admitted that the Pradhāna is established by Inference, the Sānkhya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradhāna is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, &amp;lsquo;In order that the soul may know the Pradhāna and become isolated&amp;rsquo; (Sānkhya Kā. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhāna is fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible. For, as the soul consists of pure intelligence, is inactive, changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable neither of fruition which consists in consciousness of Prakr̥ti, nor of Release which consists in separation from Prakr̥ti. If, on the other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described is, owing to the mere nearness of Prakr̥ti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prakr̥ti, it follows that, as Prakr̥ti is ever near, the soul will never accomplish emancipation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And &amp;lsquo;From this connexion therewith (i.e. with the soul) the non-intelligent appears as intelligent; and although all agency belongs to the guṇas, the indifferent (soul) becomes an agent. In order that the soul may know the Pradhāna and become isolated, the connexion of the two takes place like that of the lame and the blind; and thence creation springs&amp;rsquo; (20, 21).&amp;ndash;Now to that which is eternally unchanging, non-active and isolated, the attributes of being a witness and an enjoying and cognising agent can in no way belong. Nor also can such a being be subject to error resting on&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We shall now prove that the view of atoms constituting the universal cause is untenable likewise. &amp;lsquo;Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the atomic&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Is untenable&amp;rsquo; must be supplied from the preceding Sūtra; &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo; has to be taken in the sense of &amp;lsquo;and.&amp;rsquo; The sense of the Sūtra is&amp;ndash;in the same way as the big and long, i.e. as the theory of ternary compounds originating from the short and the atomic, i.e. from binary compounds and simple atoms is untenable, so everything else which they (the Vaiśeshikas) maintain is untenable; or, in other words&amp;ndash;as the theory of the woild originating from atoms through binary compounds is untenable, so everything else is likewise untenable.&amp;ndash;Things consisting of parts, as e.g. a piece of cloth, are produced by their parts, e.g. threads, being joined by means of the six sides which are parts of those parts. Analogously the atoms also must be held to originate binary compounds in the way of combining by means of their six sides; for if the atoms possessed no distinction of parts (and hence filled no space), a group of even a thousand atoms would not differ in extension from a single atom, and the different kinds of extension&amp;ndash;minuteness, shortness, bigness, length, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;would never emerge. If, on the other hand, it is admitted that the atoms also have distinct sides, they have parts and are made up of those parts, and those parts again are made up of their parts, and so on in infiuitum.&amp;ndash;But, the Vaiśeshika may object, the difference between a mustard seed and a mountain is due to the paucity of the constituent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To explain. The Vaiśeshikas assume the so-called samavāya relation, defining it as &amp;rsquo;that connexion which is the cause of the idea &amp;ldquo;this is here,&amp;rdquo; in the case of things permanently and inseparably connected, and standing to each other in the relation of abode and thing abiding in the abode.&amp;rsquo; Now, if such a samavāya relation is assumed in order to account for the fact that things observed to be inseparably connected&amp;ndash;as, e.g., class characteristics are inseparably connected with the individuals to which they belong&amp;ndash;are such, i.e. inseparably connected, a reason has also to be searched for why the samavāya, which is of the same nature as those things (in so far, namely, as it is also inseparably connected with the things connected by it), is such; and for that reason, again, a further reason has to be postulated, and so on, &lt;em&gt;in infinitum&lt;/em&gt;. Nor can it be said that inseparable connexion must be assumed to constitute the essential nature of samavāya (so that no further reason need be demanded for its inseparable connexion); for on this reasoning you would have to assume the same essential nature for class characteristics, qualities, and so on (which would render the assumption of a samavāya needless for them also). Nor is it a legitimate proceeding to postulate an unseen entity such as the samavāya is, and then to assume for it such and such an essential nature.&amp;ndash;These objections apply to the samavāya whether it be viewed as eternal or non-eternal. The next Sūtra urges a further objection against it if viewed as eternal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For things possessing colour, e.g. jars, are non-eternal, because it is observed that they are produced from other causes of the same, i.e. non-eternal nature, and so on. To a non-perceived thing which is assumed in accordance with what is actually perceived, we may not ascribe any attributes that would be convenient to us; and it is in accordance with actual experience that you Vaiśeshikas assume the atoms to possess colour and other qualities. Hence your theory is untenable.&amp;ndash;Let it then, in order to avoid this difficulty, be assumed that the atoms do not possess colour and other sensible qualities. To this alternative the next Sūtra refers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For as the qualities of effected things depend on the qualities of their causes, earth, water, and so on, would in that case be destitute of qualities. And if to avoid this difficulty, it be held that the atoms do possess qualities, we are again met by the difficulty stated in the preceding Sūtra. Objections thus arising in both cases, the theory of the atoms is untenable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even on the aggregate with its two causes, there is non-establishment of that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We so far have refuted the Vaiseshikas, who hold the doctrine of atoms constituting the general cause. Now the followers of Buddha also teach that the world originates from atoms, and the Sūtras therefore proceed to declare that on their view also the origination, course, and so on, of the world cannot rationally be accounted for. These Bauddhas belong to four different classes. Some of them hold that all outward things, which are either elements (bhūta) or elemental (bhautika), and all inward things which are either mind (kitta) or mental (kaitta),&amp;ndash;all these things consisting of aggregates of the atoms of earth, water, fire and air&amp;ndash;are proved by means of Perception as well as Inference. Others hold that all external things, earth, and so on, are only to be inferred from ideas (vijñāna). Others again teach that the only reality are ideas to which no outward things correspond; the (so-called) outward things are like the things seen in dreams. The three schools mentioned agree in holding that the things admitted by them have a momentary existence only, and do not allow that, in addition to the things mentioned, viz. elements and elemental things, mind and mental things, there are certain further independent entities such as ether, Self, and so on.&amp;ndash;Others finally assert a universal void, i.e. the non-reality of everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that (this) is to be explained through successive causality; we say &amp;rsquo;no,&amp;rsquo; on account of their not being the causes of aggregation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;If it be said that through the successive causality of Nescience and so on, the formation of aggregates and other matters may be satisfactorily accounted for.&amp;rsquo; To explain. Although all the entities (acknowledged by the Bauddhas) have a merely momentary existence, yet all that is accounted for by avidyā. Avidyā means that conception, contrary to reality, by which permanency, and so on, are ascribed to what is momentary, and so on. Through avidyā there are originated desire, aversion, &amp;amp;c., which are comprised under the general term &amp;lsquo;impression&amp;rsquo; (saṁskāra); and from those there springs cognition (vijñāna) which consists in the &amp;lsquo;kindling&amp;rsquo; of mind; from that mind (citta) and what is of the nature of mind (caitta) and the substances possessing colour, and so on. viz. earth, water, &amp;amp;c. From that again the six sense-organs, called &amp;rsquo;the six abodes&amp;rsquo;; from that the body, called &amp;rsquo;touch&amp;rsquo; (sparśa); from that sensation (vedanā), and so on. And from that again avidyā, and the whole series as described; so that there is an endlessly revolving cycle, in which avidyā, and so on, are in turn the causes of the links succeeding them. Now all this is not possible without those aggregates of the elements and elemental things which are called earth, and so on; and thereby the rationality of the formation of those aggregates is proved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the time when the subsequent momentary existence originates, the preceding momentary existence has passed away, and it cannot therefore stand in a causal relation towards the subsequent one. For if non-existence had causal power, anything might originate at any time at any place.&amp;ndash;Let it then be said that what constitutes a cause is nothing else but existence in a previous moment.&amp;ndash;But, if this were so, the previous momentary existence of a jar, let us say, would be the cause of all things whatever that would be met with in this threefold world in the subsequent moment-cows, buffaloes, horses, chairs, stones, &amp;amp;c.!&amp;ndash;Let us then say that a thing existing in a previous moment is the cause only of those things, existing in the subsequent moment, which belong to the same species.&amp;ndash;But from this again it would follow that one jar existing in the previous moment would be the cause of all jars, to be met with in any place, existing in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;20&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There not being (a cause), there results contradiction of the admitted principle; otherwise simultaneousness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it be said that the effect may originate even when a cause does not exist, then&amp;ndash;as we have pointed out before&amp;ndash;anything might originate anywhere and at any time. And not only would the origination of the effect thus remain unexplained, but an admitted principle would also be contradicted. For you hold the principle that there are four causes bringing about the origination of a cognition, viz. the adhipati-cause, the sahakāri-cause, the ālambhana-cause, and the samanantara-cause. The term adhipati denotes the sense-organs.&amp;ndash;And if, in order to avoid opposition to an acknowledged principle, it be assumed that the origination of a further momentary jar takes place at the time when the previous momentary jar still exists, then it would follow that the two momentary jars, the causal one and the effected one, would be perceived together; but as a matter of fact they are not so perceived. And, further, the doctrine of general momentariness would thus be given up. And should it be said that(this is not so, but that) momentariness remains, it would follow that the connexion of the sense-organ with the object and the cognition are simultaneous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is non-establishment of pratisankhyā&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and apratisankhyā destruction, on account of non-interruption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far the hypothesis of origination from that which is not has been refuted. The present Sūtra now goes on to declare that also the absolute (niranvaya) destruction of that which is cannot rationally be demonstrated. Those who maintain the momentariness of all things teach that there are two kinds of destruction, one of a gross kind, which consists in the termination of a series of similar momentary existences, and is capable of being perceived as immediately resulting from agencies such as the blow of a hammer (breaking a jar, e.g.); and the other of a subtle kind, not capable of being perceived, and taking place in a series of similar momentary existences at every moment. The former is called pratisankhyā-destruction; the latter apratisankhyā-destruction.&amp;ndash;Both these kinds of destruction are not possible.&amp;ndash;Why?&amp;ndash;On account of the non-interruption, i.e. on account of the impossibility of the complete destruction of that which is. The impossibility of such destruction was proved by us under II, 1, 14, where we showed that origination and destruction mean only the assumption of new states on the part of one and the same permanent substance, and therefrom proved the non-difference of the effect from the cause.&amp;ndash;Here it may possibly be objected that as we see that a light when extinguished passes away absolutely, such absolute destruction may be inferred in other cases also. But against this we point out that in the case of a vessel of clay being smashed we perceive that the material, i.e. clay, continues to exist, and that therefrom destruction is ascertained to be nothing else but the passing over of a real substance into another state. The pioper assumption, therefore, is that the extinguished light also has passed over into a different state, and that in that state it is no longer perceptible may be explained by that state being an extremely subtle one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The acknowledgment of either of these views gives rise to difficulties. If the effect originates from nothing, it is itself of the nature of nothing; for it is observed that effects share the nature of what they originate from. Pitchers and ornaments, e.g. which are produced from clay and gold respectively, possess the nature of their causal substances. But you hold yourself that the world is not seen to be of the nature of nothingness; and certainly it is not observed to be so.&amp;ndash;Again, if that which is underwent absolute destruction, it would follow that after one moment the entire world would pass away into nothingness; and subsequently the world again originating from nothingness, it would follow that, as shown above, it would itself be of the nature of nothingness (i.e. there would no longer be a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; world).&amp;ndash;There being thus difficulties on both views, origination and destruction cannot take place as described by you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This gives us an opportunity to disprove the view of Ether(space) being likewise a mere irrational non-entity, as the Bauddhas hold it to be. Ether cannot be held to be a mere irrational non-entity, because, like those things which are admitted to be positive existences, i.e. earth, and so on, it is proved by consciousness not invalidated by any means of proof. For the formation of immediate judgments such as &amp;lsquo;here a hawk flies, and there a vulture,&amp;rsquo; implies our being conscious of ether as marking the different places of the flight of the different birds. Nor is it possible to hold that Space is nothing else but the non-existence (abhāva) of earth, and so on; for this view collapses as soon as set&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To be an object of cognition means nothing more than to be the cause of the origination of cognition. Nor does this definition imply that the sense-organs also are the objects of cognition. For a cause of cognition is held to be an object of cognition only in so far as it imparts to the cognition its own form (and this the sense-organs do not). Now even a thing that has perished may have imparted its form to the cognition, and on the basis of that form, blue colour, and so on, the thing itself is inferred. Nor can it be said (as the Yogācāras do) that the form of subsequent cognitions is due to the action of previous cognitions (and not to the external thing); for on this hypothesis it could not be explained how in the midst of a series of cognitions of blue colour there all at once arises the cognition of yellow colour. The manifold character of cognitions must therefore be held to be due to the manifold character of real thing.&amp;ndash;To this we reply &amp;rsquo;not from non-entity; this not being observed.&amp;rsquo; The special forms of cognition, such as blue colour, and so on, cannot be the forms of things that have perished, and therefore are not in Being, since this is not observed. For it is not observed that when a substrate of attributes has perished, its attributes pass over into another thing. (Nor can it be said that the thing that perished leaves in cognition a reflection of itself, for) reflections also are only of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a fact that the attainment of things desired and the warding off of things not desired is effected through effort, and so on. But if all existences momentarily perish, a previously existing thing, or special attributes of it, such as after-effects (through which Svarga and the like are effected) or knowledge (through which Release is effected) do not persist, and hence nothing whatever can be accomplished by effort. And as thus all effects would be accomplished without a cause, even perfectly inert men would accomplish all the ends to be reached in this and in the next life, including final release. Here terminates the adhikarana of &amp;rsquo;the aggregates.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is no reasonable ground, they say, for the view that the manifoldness of ideas is due to the manifoldness of things, since ideas themselves&amp;ndash;no less than the things assumed by others&amp;ndash;have their distinct forms, and hence are manifold. And this manifold nature of ideas is sufficiently explained by so-called vāsanā. Vāsanā means a flow of ideas (states of consciousness&amp;ndash;pratyaya) of different character. We observe, e.g., that a cognition which has the form of a jar (i.e. the idea of a jar) gives rise to the cognition of the two halves of a jar, and is itself preceded and produced by the cognition of a jar, and this again by a similar cognition,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For dream-cognitions are originated by organs impaired by certain defects, such as drowsiness, and are moreover sublated by the cognitions of the waking state; while the cognitions of the waking state are of a contrary nature. There is thus no equality between the two sets.&amp;ndash;Moreover, if all cognitions are empty of real content, you are unable to prove what you wish to prove since your inferential cognition also is devoid of true content. If, on the other hand, it be held to have a real content, then it follows that no cognition is devoid of such content; for all of them are alike cognitions, just like the inferential cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The world further comprises six substances (dravya), viz. souls (jīva), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), bodies (pudgala), time (kāla), and space (ākāśa). The souls are of three different kinds-bound (in the state of bondage), perfected by Yoga (Yogasiddha), and released (mukta). &amp;lsquo;Merit&amp;rsquo; is that particular world-pervading substance which is the cause of the motion of all things moving; &amp;lsquo;demerit&amp;rsquo; is that all-pervading substance which is the cause of stationariness, &amp;lsquo;Body&amp;rsquo; is that substance which possesses colour, smell, taste, and touch. It is of two kinds, atomic or compounded of atoms; to the latter kind belong wind, fire, water, earth, the bodies of living creatures, and so on. &amp;lsquo;Time&amp;rsquo; is a particular atomic substance which is the cause of the current distinction of past, present, and future. &amp;lsquo;Space&amp;rsquo; is one, and of infinite extent. From among these substances those which are not atomic are comprehended under the term &amp;rsquo;the five astikāyas (existing bodies)&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the astikāya of souls, the astikāya of merit, the astikāya of demerit, the astikāya of matter, the astikāya of space.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;33&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And likewise non-entireness of the Self.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On your view there would likewise follow non-entireness of the Self. For your opinion is that souls abide in numberless places, each soul having the same size as the body which it animates. When, therefore, the soul previously abiding in the body of an elephant or the like has to enter into a body of smaller size, e. g. that of an ant, it would follow that as the soul then occupies less space, it would not remain entire, but would become incomplete.&amp;ndash;Let us then avoid this difficulty by assuming that the soul passes over into a different state&amp;ndash;which process is called paryāya,&amp;ndash;which it may manage because it is capable of contraction and dilatation.&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For this would imply that the soul is subject&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to change, and all the imperfections springing from it, viz. non-permanence, and so on, and hence would not be superior to non-sentient things such as jars and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;35&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the endurance of the final (size), and the (resulting) permanency of both; there is no difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final size of the soul, i.e. the size it has in the state of Release, is enduring since the soul does not subsequently pass into another body; and both, i.e. the soul in the state of Release and the size of that soul, are permanent (nitya). From this it follows that that ultimate size is the true essential size of the soul and also belongs to it previously to Release. Hence there is no difference of sizes, and the soul cannot therefore have the size of its temporary bodies. The Ārhata theory is therefore untenable.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the impossibility in one.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Sūtras now declare that, for the same reasons, the doctrine of Paśupati also has to be disregarded. The adherents of this view belong to four different classes&amp;ndash;Kāpālas, Kālāmukhas, Pāśupatas, and Śaivas. All of them hold fanciful theories of Reality which are in conflict with the Veda, and invent various means for attaining happiness in this life and the next. They maintain the general material cause and the operative cause to be distinct, and the latter cause to be constituted by Paśupati. They further hold the wearing of the six so-called &amp;lsquo;mudrā&amp;rsquo; badges and the like to be means to accomplish the highest end of man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This being so, they must prove the Lord&amp;rsquo;s being the ruler (of the material cause) on the basis of observation. But it is impossible to prove that the Lord is the ruler of the Pradhāna in the same way as the potter e.g. is the ruler of the clay. For the Lord is without a body, while the power of ruling material causes is observed only in the case of embodied beings such as potters. Nor may you have recourse to the hypothesis of the Lord being embodied; for&amp;ndash;as we have shown under I, 1, 3&amp;ndash;there arise&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;38&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you say, as in the case of the organs; we deny this, on account of enjoyment and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may possibly be said that, in the same way as the enjoying (individual) soul, although in itself without a body, is seen to rule the sense-organs, the body, and so on, the great Lord also, although without a body, may rule the Pradhāna. But this analogy cannot be allowed &amp;lsquo;on account of enjoyment,&amp;rsquo; and so on. The body&amp;rsquo;s being ruled by the soul is due to the unseen principle in the form of good and evil works, and has for its end the requital of those works. Your analogy would thus imply that the Lord also is under the influence of an unseen principle, and is requited for his good and evil works.&amp;ndash;The Lord cannot therefore be a ruler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Paśupati theory cannot therefore be accepted.&amp;ndash;It is true that the Sūtra, &amp;lsquo;but in case of conflict (with Scripture) it is not to be regarded&amp;rsquo; (Pū. Mī. Sū. I, 3, 3), has already established the non-acceptability of all views contrary to the Veda; the present adhikaraṇa, however, raises this question again in order specially to declare that the Paśupati theory iś contrary to the Veda. Although the Pāśupata and the Śaiva systems exhibit some features which are not altogether contrary to the Veda, yet they are unacceptable because they rest on an assumption contrary to the Veda, viz. of the difference of the general, instrumental and material causes, and imply an erroneous interchange of higher and lower entities.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;Paśupati.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;40&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the impossibility of origination.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras now proceed to refute a further doubt, viz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that the Pañcarātra tantra&amp;ndash;which sets forth the means of attaining supreme beatitude, as declared by the Lord (Bhagavat)&amp;ndash;may also be destitute of authority, in so far, namely, as belonging to the same class as the tantras of Kapila and others. The above Sūtra raises the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory of the Bhāgavatas is that from Vāsudeva, who is the highest Brahman and the highest cause, there originates the individual soul called Sankarshaṇa; from Sankarshaṇa the internal organ called Pradyumna; and from Pradyumna the principle of egoity called Aniruddha. Now this theory implies the origination of the individual soul, and this is contrary to Scripture. For scriptural texts declare the soul to be without a beginning&amp;ndash;cp. &amp;rsquo;the intelligent one is not born and does not die&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 18), and other texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But this is inadmissible, since the text &amp;lsquo;from him there is produced breath, mind, and all sense-organs&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) declares that the mind also springs from none else but the highest Brahman. As the Bhāgavata doctrine thus teaches things opposed to Scripture, its authoritativeness cannot be admitted.&amp;ndash;Against these objections the next Sūtra declares itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;43&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The origination of the jīva is, moreover, distinctly controverted in the books of the Bhāgavatas also. Thus in the Parama-saṁhitā &amp;lsquo;The nature of Prakr̥ti consists therein that she is non-sentient, for the sake of another, eternal, ever-changing, comprising within herself the three guṇas. and constituting the sphere of action and experience for all agents. With her the soul (purusha) is connected in the way of inseparable association; that soul is known to be truly without beginning and without end.&amp;rsquo; And as all Saṁhitas make similar statements as to the eternity of the soul, the Pañcarātra doctrine manifestly controverts the view of the essential nature of the jiva being something that originates. How it is possible that in the Veda as well as in common life the soul is spoken of as being born, dying, &amp;amp;c., will be explained under Sū. II, 3, 17. The conclusion, therefore, is that the Bhāgavata system also denies the origination of the soul, and that hence the objections raised on this ground against its authoritativeness are without any force. Another objection is raised by some. Sāṇḍilya, they argue, is said to have promulgated the Pañcarātra doctrine because he did not find a sure basis for the highest welfare of man in the Veda and its auxiliary disciplines, and this implies that the Pañcarātra is opposed to the Veda.&amp;ndash;his objection, we reply, springs from nothing else but the mere unreasoning faith of men who do not possess the faintest knowledge&lt;/p&gt;</description>
