30. And (the divinity is) endowed with all powers, because that is seen.

The highest divinity which is different in nature from all other things is endowed with all powers; for scriptural texts show it to be such, 'His high power is revealed as manifold, as essential, and so his knowledge, force, and action' (Śvet. Up. VI, 8). In the same way another text first declares the highest divinity to differ in nature from everything else, 'Free from sin, from old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst',and then goes on to represent it as endowed with all powers, 'realising all its wishes, realising all its intentions',&c.(Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5). Compare also 'He, consisting of mind, having praṇa for his body, whose form is light, who realises his wishes,' &c. (Cḥ. Up. III, 14, 2).
