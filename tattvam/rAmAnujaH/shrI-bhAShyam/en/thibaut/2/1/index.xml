      <description>&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For we do not observe that in&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pots and jars which are fashioned out of a lump of clay there persists the quality of &amp;lsquo;being a lump&amp;rsquo; which belongs to the causal substance. And should you say that it suffices that there should be equality in some or any attribute, we point out that such is actually the case with regard to Brahman and the world, both of which have the attribute of &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; and others. The true state of the case rather is as follows. There is equality of nature between an effect and a cause, in that sense that those essential characteristics by which the causal substance distinguishes itself from other things persist in its effects also: those characteristic features, e.g., which distinguish gold from clay and other materials, persist also in things made of gold-bracelets and the like. But applying this consideration to Brahman and the world we find that Brahman&amp;rsquo;s essential nature is to be antagonistic to all evil, and to consist of knowledge, bliss and power, while the world&amp;rsquo;s essential nature is to be the opposite of all this. Brahman cannot, therefore, be the material cause of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But (there is) denotation of the superintending (deities), on account of distinction and entering.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to set aside the objection started. In texts such as &amp;rsquo;to him the earth said,&amp;rsquo; the terms &amp;rsquo;earth&amp;rsquo; and so on, denote the divinities presiding over earth and the rest.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo; Through distinction and connexion.&amp;rsquo; For earth and so on are denoted by the distinctive term &amp;lsquo;divinities&amp;rsquo;; so e.g. &amp;lsquo;Let me enter into those three divinities&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 3, 2), where fire, water, and earth are called divinities; and Kau. Up. II, 14, &amp;lsquo;All divinities contending with each other as to pre-eminence,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;all these divinities having recognised pre-eminence in prāṇa.&amp;rsquo; The &amp;rsquo;entering&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra refers to Ait. Ar. II, 4, 2, 4, &amp;lsquo;Agni having become speech entered into the mouth; Aditya having become sight entered into the eyes,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., where the text declares that Agni and other divine beings entered into the sense-organs as their superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that (the effect is) non-existing; we say no, there being a mere denial.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, an objection is raised, if Brahman, the cause, differs in nature from the effect, viz. the world, this means that cause and effect are separate things and that hence the effect does not exist in the cause, i.e. Brahman; and this again implies that the world originates from what has no existence!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. For what the preceding Sūtra has laid down is merely the denial of an absolute rule demanding that cause and effect should be of the same nature; it was not asserted that the effect is a thing altogether different and separate from the cause. We by no means abandon our tenet that Brahman the cause modifies itself so as to assume the form of a world differing from it in character. For such is the case with the honey&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of such consequences in reabsorption (the Vedānta-texts would be) inappropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;lsquo;reabsorption&amp;rsquo; here stands as an instance of all the states of Brahman, reabsorption, creation, and so on&amp;ndash;among which it is the first as appears from the texts giving instruction about those several states &amp;lsquo;Being only was this in the beginning&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;The Self only was this in the beginning.&amp;rsquo; If we accept the doctrine of the oneness of substance of cause and effect, then, absorption, creation, &amp;amp;c. of the world all being in Brahman, the different states of the world would connect themselves with Brahman, and the latter would thus be affected by all the imperfections of its effect; in the same way as all the attributes of the bracelet are present in the gold also. And the undesirable consequence of this would be that contradictory attributes as predicated in different Vedānta-texts would have to be attributed to one and the same substance; cp. &amp;lsquo;He who is all-knowing&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); &amp;lsquo;Free from sin, free from old age and death&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5); &amp;lsquo;Of him there is known neither cause nor effect&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. VI, 8); &amp;lsquo;Of these two one eats the sweet fruit&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. IV, 6); &amp;lsquo;The Self that is not a Lord is bound because he has to enjoy&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. I, 8); &amp;lsquo;On account of his impotence he laments, bewildered&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. IV, 7).&amp;ndash;Nor can we accept the explanation that, as Brahman in its causal as well as its effected state has all sentient and non-sentient beings for its body; and as all imperfections inhere in that body only, they do not touch Brahman in either its causal or effected state. For it is not possible that the world and Brahman should stand to each other in the relation of effect and cause, and if it were possible, the imperfections due to connexion with a body would necessarily cling to Brahman. It is not, we say, possible that the intelligent and non-ntelligent beings together should constitute the body of Brahman. For a body is a particular aggregate of earth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not so; as there are parallel instances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teaching of the Vedānta-texts is not inappropriate, since there are instances of good and bad qualities being separate in the case of one thing connected with two&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;different states. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra indicates the impossibility of Brahman being connected with even a shadow of what is evil. The meaning is as follows. As Brahman has all sentient and non-sentient things for its body, and constitutes the Self of that body, there is nothing contrary to reason in Brahman being connected with two states, a causal and an effected one, the essential characteristics of which are expansion on the one hand and contraction on the other; for this expansion and contraction belong (not to Brahman itself, but) to the sentient and non-sentient beings. The imperfections adhering to the body do not affect Brahman, and the good qualities belonging to the Self do not extend to the body; in the same way as youth, childhood, and old age, which are attributes of embodied beings, such as gods or men, belong to the body only, not to the embodied Self; while knowledge, pleasure and so on belong to the conscious Self only, not to the body. On this understanding there is no objection to expressions such as &amp;lsquo;he is born as a god or as a man&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the same person is a child, and then a youth, and then an old man&amp;rsquo; That the character of a god or man belongs to the individual soul only in so far as it has a body, will be shown under III, 1, 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For on this latter theory the origination of the world cannot be accounted for. The Sānkhyas hold that owing to the soul&amp;rsquo;s approximation to Prakr̥ti the attributes of the latter&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This latter point is proved by the fact that the arguments set forth by Buddha, Kaṇāda, Akshapāda, Jina, Kapila and Patañjali respectively are all mutually contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Sūtra means to say that by the demolition given above of the Sānkhya doctrine which is not comprised within the Veda the remaining theories which are in the same position, viz. the theories of Kaṇāda, Akshapāda, Jina, and Buddha, must likewise be considered as demolished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that from (Brahman) becoming an enjoyer, there follows non-distinction (of Brahman and the individual soul); we reply&amp;ndash;it may be as in ordinary life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sānkhya here comes forward with a new objection. You maintain, he says, that the highest Brahman has the character either of a cause or an effect according as it has for its body sentient and non-sentient beings in either their subtle or gross state; and that this explains the difference in nature between the individual soul and Brahman. But such difference is not possible, since Brahman, if embodied, at once becomes an enjoying subject (just like the individual soul). For if, possessing a body, the Lord necessarily experiences all pain and pleasure due to embodiedness, no less than the individual soul does.&amp;ndash;But we have, under I, 2, 8, refuted the view of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s being liable to experiences of pleasure and pain!&amp;ndash;By no means! There you have shown only that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s abiding within the heart of a creature so as to constitute the object of its devotion does not imply fruition on his part of pleasure and pain. Now, however, you maintain that the Lord is embodied just like an individual soul, and the unavoidable inference from this is that, like that soul, he undergoes pleasurable and painful experiences. For we observe that embodied souls, although not capable of participating in the changing states of the body such as childhood, old age, &amp;amp;c., yet experience pleasures and pains caused by the normal or abnormal condition of the matter constituting the body. In agreement with this Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;As long as he possesses a body there is for him no escape from pleasure and pain; but when he&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The present Sūtra now raises a primā facie objection against that very non-difference, and then proceeds to refute it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But an objection here presents itself. If these texts really imply that the &amp;lsquo;other one,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the soul, is Brahman, there will follow certain imperfections on Brahman&amp;rsquo;s part, viz. that Brahman, endowed as it is with omniscience, the power of realising its purposes, and so on, does not create a world of a nature beneficial to itself, but rather creates a world non-beneficial to itself; and the like. This world no doubt is a storehouse of numberless pains, either originating in living beings themselves or due to the action of other natural beings, or caused by supernatural agencies. No rational independent person endeavours to produce what is clearly non-beneficial to himself. And as you hold the view of the non-difference of the world from Brahman, you yourself set aside all those texts which declare Brahman to be different from the soul; for were there such difference, the doctrine of general non-difference could not be established. Should it be maintained that the texts declaring difference refer to difference due to limiting adjuncts, while the texts declaring non-difference mean essential non-difference, we must ask the following question&amp;ndash;does the non-conditioned Brahman know, or does it not know, the soul which is essentially non-different from it? If it does not know it, Brahman&amp;rsquo;s omniscience has to be abandoned. If, on the other hand, it knows it, then&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 7, 22); &amp;lsquo;Knowing as separate the Self and the Mover, blessed by him he gains Immortality&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;23&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is impossibility of that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the same way as it is impossible that the different non-sentient things such as stones, iron, wood, herbs, &amp;amp;c., which are of an extremely low constitution and subject to constant change, should be one in nature with Brahman, which is faultless, changeless, fundamentally antagonistic to all that is evil, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.; so it is also impossible that the individual soul, which is liable to endless suffering, and a mere wretched glowworm as it were, should be one with Brahman who, as we know from the texts, comprises within himself the treasure of all auspicious qualities, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. Those texts, which exhibit Brahman and the soul in coordination, must be understood as conveying the doctrine, founded on passages such as &amp;lsquo;of whom the Self is the body,&amp;rsquo; that as the jīva constitutes Brahman&amp;rsquo;s body and Brahman abides within the jīva as its Self, Brahman has the jīva for its mode; and with this doctrine the co-ordination referred to is not only not in conflict but even confirms it&amp;ndash;as we have shown repeatedly, e.g. under Sū. I, 4, 22. Brahman&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We now proceed to show that it is not unreasonable to hold that, possessing all those attributes, it is able to effect by its mere will and wish the creation of this entire manifold Universe.&amp;ndash;But, it may here be said, it is certainly a matter of observation that agents of limited power are obliged to employ a number of instrumental agencies in order to effect their purposes; but how should it follow therefrom that the view of the all-powerful Brahman producing the world without such instrumental agencies is in any way irrational?&amp;ndash;As, we reply, it is observed in ordinary life that even such agents as possess the capability of producing certain effects stand in need of certain instruments, some slow-witted person may possibly imagine that Brahman, being destitute of all such instruments, is incapable of creating the world. It is this doubt which we have to dispel. It is seen that potters, weavers, &amp;amp;c., who produce jars, cloth, and the like, are incapable of actually producing unless they make use of certain implements, although they may fully&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This one, non-divided, Brahman thereupon having formed the resolution of being many divided itself into the aggregate of material things&amp;ndash;ether, air, and so on&amp;ndash;and the aggregate of souls from Brahmā down to blades of grass. This being so, it must be held that the entire highest Brahman entered into the effected state; that its intelligent part divided itself into the individual souls, and its non-intelligent part into ether, air, and so on. This however stultifies all those often-quoted texts which declare Brahman in its causal state to be devoid of parts. For although the cause is constituted by Brahman in so far as having for its body matter and souls in their subtle state, and the effect by Brahman invested with matter and souls in their gross state; the difficulty stated above cannot be avoided, since also that element in Brahman which is embodied is held to enter into the effect. If, on the other hand, Brahman is without parts, it cannot become many, and it is not possible that there should persist a part not entering into the effected state. On the ground of these unacceptable results we conclude that Brahman cannot be the cause.&amp;ndash;This objection the next Sūtra disposes of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is no&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;inappropriateness; &amp;lsquo;on account of Scripture.&amp;rsquo; Scripture declares on the one hand that Brahman is not made up of parts, and on the other that from it a multiform creation proceeds. And in matters vouched for by Scripture we must conform our ideas to what Scripture actually says.&amp;ndash;But then Scripture might be capable of conveying to us ideas of things altogether self-contradictory; like as if somebody were to tell us &amp;lsquo;Water with fire&amp;rsquo;!&amp;ndash;The Sūtra therefore adds &amp;lsquo;on account of its being founded on the word.&amp;rsquo; As the possession, on Brahman&amp;rsquo;s part, of various powers (enabling it to emit the world) rests exclusively on the authority of the word of the Veda and thus differs altogether from other matters (which fall within the sphere of the other means of knowledge also), the admission of such powers is not contrary to reason.

But that such attributes do not extend to the Self is due to the variety of the essential nature of things. This the Sūtra expresses in &amp;lsquo;for (there are) manifold (powers).&amp;rsquo; We perceive that fire, water, and so on, which are of different kind, possess different powers, viz. heat, and so on: there is therefore nothing unreasonable in the view that the highest Brahman which differs in kind from all things observed in ordinary life should possess innumerous powers not perceived in ordinary things. Thus Parāśara also&amp;ndash;in reply to a question founded on ordinary observation&amp;ndash;viz. &amp;lsquo;How can creative energy be attributed to Brahman, devoid of qualities, pure, &amp;amp;c.?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;declares &amp;lsquo;Numberless powers, lying beyond the sphere of all ordinary thought, belong to Brahman, and qualify it for creation, and so on; just as&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 8). In the same way another text first declares the highest divinity to differ in nature from everything else, &amp;lsquo;Free from sin, from old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst&amp;rsquo;,and then goes on to represent it as endowed with all powers, &amp;lsquo;realising all its wishes, realising all its intentions&amp;rsquo;,&amp;amp;c.(Cḥ.

It is in this spirit that Scripture says &amp;lsquo;He sees without eyes, he hears without ears, without hands and feet he hastens and grasps&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up.

In the case of all those who enter on some activity after having formed an idea of the effect to be accomplished, there exists a motive in the form of something beneficial either to themselves or to others. Now Brahman, to whose essential nature it belongs that all his wishes are eternally fulfilled, does not attain through the creation of the world any object not attained before. Nor again is the second alternative possible. For a being, all whose wishes are fulfilled, could concern itself about others only with a view to benefitting them. No merciful divinity would create a world so full, as ours is, of evils of all kind&amp;ndash;birth, old age, death, hell, and so on;&amp;ndash;if it created at all, pity would move it to create a world altogether happy. Brahman thus having no possible motive cannot be the cause of the world.&amp;ndash;This primā facie view is disposed of in the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We see in ordinary life how some great king, ruling this earth with its seven dvīpas, and possessing perfect strength, valour, and so on, has a game at balls, or the like, from no other motive than to amuse himself; hence there is no objection to the view that sport only is the motive prompting Brahman to the creation, sustentation, and destruction of this world which is easily fashioned by his mere will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the assumption of his having actually created the world would lay him open to the charge of partiality, in so far as the world contains beings of high, middle, and low station&amp;ndash;gods, men, animals, immovable beings; and to that of cruelty, in so far as he would be instrumental in making his creatures experience pain of the most dreadful kind.&amp;ndash;The reply to this is &amp;rsquo;not so, on account of there being regard&amp;rsquo;; i.e. &amp;lsquo;on account of the inequality of creation depending on the deeds of the intelligent beings, gods, and so on, about to be created.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Śruti and Smr̥ti alike declare that the connexion of the individual souls with bodies of different kinds&amp;ndash;divine, human, animal, and so on&amp;ndash;depends on the karman of those souls; compare &amp;lsquo;He who performs good works becomes good, he who performs bad works becomes bad. He becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 5). In the same way the reverend Parāśara declares that what causes the difference in nature and status between gods, men, and so on, is the power of the former deeds of the souls about to enter into a new creation&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;He (the Lord) is the operative cause only in the creation of new beings; the material cause is constituted by the potentialities of the beings to be created. The being to be embodied requires nothing but an operative cause; it is its own potentiality which leads its being into that condition of being (which it is to occupy in the new creation).&amp;rsquo; Potentiality here means karman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
