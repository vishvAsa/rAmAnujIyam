      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-pāda&#34;&gt;THIRD PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not Ether; on account of the absence of scriptural statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated that the Sānkhya-system and other systems standing outside the Veda are untenable since they rest on fallacious reasoning and are self-contradictory. In order to prove that our own view is altogether free from all objections of this kind, we shall now explain in detail the mode in which this world, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings, is produced by Brahman, whom we hold to be the general creator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But there is.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is origination of Ether. For Scripture, which is concerned with matters transcending sense perception, is able to establish the truth even of the origination of Ether, although this be not proved by other means of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in a matter known from Scripture a contradictory inference, such as that Ether cannot originate because it is without parts, is not of sufficient force. That the non-originatedness of the Self also does not rest on its being without parts will be shown further on.&amp;ndash;Here the Pūrvapakshin raises an objection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It has a secondary sense, on account of impossibility and of the text.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;From that Self there sprang Ether.&amp;rsquo; the origination of Ether is not to be taken in its literal sense; for according to the Cḥāndogya-text &amp;lsquo;it sent forth fire.&amp;rsquo; Brahman engaged in creation first produces fire, and fire thus having the first place, the text cannot possibly mean to say that Ether also was produced. Moreover, there is another text, viz.&amp;lsquo;Vāyu and antariksha (i.e. Ether), this is the Immortal,&amp;rsquo; according to which Ether is immortal, i. e. non-produced.&amp;ndash;But how can one and the same word viz. it &amp;lsquo;sprang&amp;rsquo; (i.e. originated), be taken in a metaphorical sense with reference to Ether, and in its literal sense with reference to fire, and so on?&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There may be (a double sense) of the one (word), as in the case of the word &amp;lsquo;Brahman.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since in the clause &amp;lsquo;from that Self there sprang Brahman,&amp;rsquo; the word &amp;lsquo;sprang&amp;rsquo; cannot be taken in its literal senbe, it may be used there in a secondary sense; while the same word as connected with the subsequent clauses &amp;lsquo;from Vāyu Agni,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., may have its primary sense. This would be analogous to the use of the word Brahman in Mu. Up. I, 1. There in the clause &amp;lsquo;From him is born that Brahman, name, form, and matter&amp;rsquo; (9). the word &lt;em&gt;Brahman&lt;/em&gt; is used in a secondary sense, i.e. denotes the Pradhāna; while in the same chapter, in the clause &amp;lsquo;Brahman swells by means of brooding&amp;rsquo; (8), the same word denotes Brahman in its primary sense. It is true indeed that in this latter case the. word &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; occurs twice; while in the Taitt. text the word &amp;lsquo;sambhūta&amp;rsquo; occurs once only, and has to be carried&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The non-abandonment of the promissory statement (results) from non-difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not appropriate to assume, from deference to the Cḥāndogya-text, a secondary meaning for those other texts also which declare Ether to have originated. For the Cḥāndogyaitself virtually admits the origination of Ether; in so far, namely, as the clause &amp;rsquo;that by which the non-heard is heard,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., declares that through the knowledge of Brahman everything is known. This declaration is not abandoned, i.e. is adhered to, only if the Ether also is an effect of Brahman and thus non-different from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the first place which there is assigned to fire rests only thereon that no mention is made of the creation of Ether, and this has no force to negative the creation of Ether as positively stated in other texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That a special Sūtra is devoted to the origination of air&amp;ndash;instead of disposing in one Sūtra of Ether and air&amp;ndash;is for the sake of Sūtra 10, which states that &amp;lsquo;hence (i.e. from air) there originated fire.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is non-origination of that which is, i.e. of Brahman only; of whatever is different from Brahman non-origination cannot possibly be established. This means&amp;ndash;the origination of Ether and air has been proved only in order to illustrate a general truth. Only that which iś, i.e. Brahman, which is the general cause, cannot originate. Whatever is other than Brahman, i. e. the entire world comprising the Unevolved, the great principle (mahat), ahankāra, the tanmātras, the sense-organs, the Ether, the air, and so on, cannot possibly be shown to be non-originated, since its being an effect is proved by the text declaring that everything is known through one thing, and in other ways.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the Ether.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The doubt now arises whether the more remote effects of Brahman originate, each of them, only from that substance which is their immediately antecedent cause or from Brahman in the form of that substance.&amp;ndash;The decision is that they originate from those&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;substances only; for the text &amp;lsquo;from air fire&amp;rsquo; directly states the origination of fire from air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

II. 1, 1). &amp;lsquo;It (water) sent forth food&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 2, 3). But how can the word &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; denote earth?&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Earth on account of the subject-matter, the colour, and other texts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That the word &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; denotes the earth is to be inferred from the fact that the section in which the word occurs has for its subject-matter the creation of the elements; as everything eatable is a product of the earth, the term denoting the effect is there applied to denote the cause. In the same chapter, where the colour of the elements is mentioned (&amp;lsquo;The red colour of a flame is the colour of fire, the white one that of water, the black one that of food &amp;lsquo;), the collocation of words clearly shows that &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; means something of the same kind as fire and water, viz. the elements of earth. And there are other texts also which treat of the same topic and declare the origination of earth from water, cp. Taitt. Up. II, 1, &amp;lsquo;from fire sprang water, from water earth.&amp;rsquo; All this proves that the term &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; denotes earth, and that hence earth originates from water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of all effected things, the &lt;em&gt;Mahat&lt;/em&gt;, and so on, the highest Person himself, in so far as embodied in the immediately preceding substance, is the direct cause.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;From the inferential mark supplied by the reflection of them.&amp;rsquo; By &amp;lsquo;reflection&amp;rsquo; the Sūtra means the resolve expressed in the recurring phrase, &amp;lsquo;May I be many&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;That fire thought, may I be many&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;That water thought, may I be many&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). As these texts declare that there was thought in the form of a resolve of self-multiplication&amp;ndash;which thought can belong to a Self only, we conclude that also the Mahat, the ahankāra, the Ether, and so on, accomplish the sending forth of their respective effects only after similar thought, and such thought can belong only to the highest Brahman embodied in the Mahat, ahankāra, and so on. That the highest Brahman is embodied in all beings and constitutes their Self, is directly stated in the antaryāmin-brāhmaṇa, &amp;lsquo;He who abiding in the earth; abiding in water; abiding in fire,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. III, 7, 3 ff.); and likewise in the Subāla-Up, &amp;lsquo;Whose body is the earth,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c., up to &amp;lsquo;Whose body is the Unevolved.&amp;rsquo; The Pūrvapakshin had maintained that the creation, from Brahman, of breath, and so on, which is declared in texts such as &amp;lsquo;From him are born breath, mind,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., may be understood as a mediate creation. This point is taken up by the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The direct origination from Brahman of all effects&amp;ndash;which in passages such as the one quoted by the Pūrvapakshin is stated in a form the reverse of the (true) order of origination according to which the Unevolved, the Mahat, the ahankāra, Ether, and so on, succeed each other&amp;ndash;is possible only on the supposition of the origination of each effect being really from Brahman itself in the form of a special causal substance. To understand the causality of Brahman as a merely mediate one would be to contradict all those statements of immediate origination. Texts such as the one quoted thus confirm the conclusion that everything originates from Brahman directly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We cannot, the opponent says, admit the conclusion that the passage from the Muṇḍka Up. &amp;lsquo;from him is born breath, mind,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., declares the immediate origination from Brahman of all things, and that hence the passage confirms the view, first suggested by the inferential mark of &amp;rsquo;thought&amp;rsquo; (see above, Sū. 14), that everything springs from Brahman direct. For the purport of the text is to state a certain order of succession, and we hence conclude that all the beings mentioned were successively created. In the second half of the text we recognise the series of ether, air, fire, &amp;amp;c., which is known to us from other texts, and from the fact of their being exhibited in one and the same text we conclude that knowledge and mind&amp;ndash;which are mentioned between breath on the one side and the elements on the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(The primā facie view here is as follows.) As Brahman, which has all things for its modes, is not the object of Perception and the other means of knowledge which give rise to the apprehension of the things only which are Brahman&amp;rsquo;s modes, and as hence, previously to the study of the Vedānta-texts, the idea of that to which the modes belong (i.e. of Brahman) does not arise, and as the knowledge of all words finally denoting Brahman depends on the existence of the idea of that to which the modes belong (i. e.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not the Self, on account of scriptural statement, and on account of the eternity (which results) from them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras so far have stated that this entire world, from Ether downwards, originates from the highest Brahman. It now becomes a matter for discussion whether the individual soul also originates in the same way or not.&amp;ndash;It does so originate, the Pūrvapakshin maintains. For on this assumption only the scriptural statement as to the cognition of all things through the cognition of one thing holds good, and moreover Scripture declares that before creation everything was one. Moreover, there are texts directly stating that the soul also was produced in the same way as Ether and other created things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For this very reason (the individual soul is) a knower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that, different therein from Ether and the rest, the soul is not produced. This leads to the consideration of the soul&amp;rsquo;s essential nature. Is that essential nature constituted by mere intelligence as Sugata and Kapila hold; or is the soul as Kaṇāda thinks, essentially non-intelligent, comparable to a stone, while intelligence is merely an adventitious quality of it; or is it essentially a knowing subject?&amp;ndash;The soul is mere intelligence, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for the reason that Scripture declares it to be so. For in the antaryāmin-brāhmaṇa the clause which in the Mādhyandina-text runs as follows, &amp;lsquo;he who abides in the Self,&amp;rsquo; is in the text of the Kāṇvas represented by the clause &amp;lsquo;he who abides in knowledge.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Its passing out is described in the following passage &amp;lsquo;by that light this Self departs, either through the eye, or through the skull, or through other parts of the body&amp;rsquo; (B_ri._ Up. IV, 4, 2). Its going in the following text &amp;lsquo;all those who pass away out of this world go to the moon,&amp;rsquo; and its returning in the text &amp;lsquo;from that world he comes again into this world, for action.&amp;rsquo; All this going, and so on, cannot be reconciled with the soul being present everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &amp;lsquo;passing out&amp;rsquo; might somehow be reconciled with a non-moving Self (such as the omnipresent Self would be) if it were taken in the sense of the Self separating from the body; but for the going and returning no analogous explanation is possible. They, therefore, must be taken as effected by the Self itself (which, then, cannot be omnipresent and non-moving).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;22&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that (the soul) is not atomic, on account of scriptural statement of (what is) not that; we say no, on account of the other one being the topic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The passage &amp;lsquo;He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Prāṇas, the person consisting of knowledge&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 7) introduces as the topic of discussion the personal Self, and further on in the same chapter we read &amp;rsquo;the unborn Self, the great one&amp;rsquo; (IV, 4, 22). The personal Self, being expressly called &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, cannot, therefore, be atomic!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. &amp;lsquo;Since the other one is the topic.&amp;rsquo; In the second text quoted that Self which is other than the personal Self&amp;ndash;i.e. the highest Self (prājña) constitutes the topic. In the beginning of the chapter, indeed, the individual Self is introduced, but later on, between the two texts quoted, the instruction begins to concern itself with the highest Self, &amp;lsquo;he by whom there is known the Self of intelligence&amp;rsquo; (pratibuddha ātmā; IV, 4, 13). It is this latter Self which, in 22 is called &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, not the individual Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 1, 9).&amp;ndash;By the term &amp;lsquo;unmāna&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra we have to understand measurement by selection of comparative instances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture declares the minuteness of the individual Self by reference to things which are like atoms in size, &amp;lsquo;The individual soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred times, and yet it is to be infinite&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. V, 9); &amp;rsquo;that lower one is seen of the measure of the point of a goad&amp;rsquo; (V, 8). For these reasons also the individual Self must be viewed as atomic.&amp;ndash;But this conflicts with the fact that sensation extends over the whole body!&amp;ndash;This objection the next Sūtra refutes by means of an analogous instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;25&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said (that this is not so) on account of specialisation of abode; we say no, on account of the acknowledgment (of a place of the Self), viz. in the heart.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a difference. The drop of ointment can produce its effect as at any rate it is in contact with a definite part of the body. But we know of no such part in the case of the soul!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. Scripture informs us that the Self abides in a definite part of the body, viz. the heart. &amp;lsquo;For that Self is in the heart, there are a hundred and one veins.&amp;rsquo; And in reply to the question &amp;lsquo;What is that Self?&amp;rsquo; the text has &amp;lsquo;He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Prāṇas, the Person of light, consisting of knowledge&amp;rsquo; (B_ri._ Up. IV, 3, 7).&amp;ndash;The parallel case of the sandal-ointment is referred to in order to point out that the Self abides in some particular part of the body; while the ointment is not bound to any special place.&amp;ndash;In the next Sūtra the Sūtrakāra proceeds to state how, according to his own view, the Self, although abiding in one spot only, gives rise to effects extending over the whole body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Self extends through the whole body by means of its quality, viz. knowledge or consciousness. &amp;lsquo;As light.&amp;rsquo; As the light of things abiding in one place&amp;ndash;such as gems, the sun, and so on&amp;ndash;is seen to extend to many places, so the consciousness of the Self dwelling in the heart pervades the entire body. That the knowledge of the knowing subject may extend beyond its substrate, as the light of a luminous body does, we have already explained under the first Sūtra.&amp;ndash;But it has been said that the Self is &lt;em&gt;mere&lt;/em&gt; knowledge; how then can knowledge be said to be a quality&amp;ndash;which is something different from the essential nature of a thing?&amp;ndash;This the next Sūtra explains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

IV, 3, 30).&amp;ndash;It has been said that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;he who abiding in knowledge&amp;rsquo; (B_ri._ Up. III, 7, 22); &amp;lsquo;Knowledge performs the sacrifice&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 5, 1); &amp;lsquo;having knowledge for its nature, absolutely free from stain,&amp;lsquo;Scripture speaks of the Self as being mere knowledge (not a knower).

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But (the Self) is designated as that because it has that quality (viz. knowledge) for its essential quality; as in the case of the intelligent (prājña) Self.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; discards the objection. Because that quality, viz. the quality of knowledge, is the essential quality, therefore the Self is, in the passages quoted, designated as knowledge. For knowledge constitutes the essential quality of the Self. Similarly, the intelligent highest Self is occasionally called &amp;lsquo;Bliss,&amp;rsquo; because bliss is its essential quality. Compare &amp;lsquo;If that bliss existed not in the ether&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7, 1); &amp;lsquo;He perceived that bliss is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1). That bliss is the essential attribute of Brahman is proved by texts such as &amp;lsquo;That is one bliss of Brahman&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He who knows the bliss of Brahman is afraid of nothing&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 4, 1).&amp;ndash;Or else the analogous case to which the Sūtra refers may be that of the intelligent Brahman being designated by the term &amp;lsquo;knowledge,&amp;rsquo; in texts such as &amp;lsquo;Truth, knowledge, the Infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1). That knowledge is the essential quality of Brahman is known from passages such as &amp;rsquo;together with the intelligent Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;He who is all-knowing&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;30&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And there is no objection, since (the quality of knowledge) exists wherever the Self is; this being observed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since knowledge is an attribute which is met with wherever a Self is, there is no objection to the Self being designated by that attribute. Similarly we observe that special kinds of cows, as e.g. hornless ones, are designated by the term &amp;lsquo;cow,&amp;rsquo; since the quality of possessing the generic character of cows is met with everywhere in connexion with the essential character of such animals with mutilated horns; since in fact that quality contributes to define their essential character. The &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra is meant to suggest a further argument, viz. that to apply to the Self the term &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; is suitable for that reason also that like knowledge the Self is self-illuminated. The objection that knowledge or consciousness cannot be an attribute inseparably connected with the essential nature of the Self as there is no consciousness in deep sleep and similar states is taken up in the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;31&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since there may be manifestation of that which exists; as in the case of virile power and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to set the raised objection aside. The case may be that while consciousness is present also in deep sleep, and so on, it is manifested in the waking state only; whence there would be no objection to viewing consciousness as an essential attribute of the Self. &amp;lsquo;As in the case of virile power and the like.&amp;rsquo; Special substances such as the virile element are indeed present in the male child already, but then are not manifest, while later on they manifest themselves with advancing youth; but all the same the possession of those substances is essential to the male being, not merely adventitious. For to be made up of seven elementary substances (viz. blood, humour, flesh, fat, marrow, bone, and semen) is an essential, property of the body. That even in deep sleep and similar states the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; shines forth we have explained above. Consciousness is always there, but only in the waking state and in dreams it is observed to relate itself to objects. And that to be a subject of cognition, and so on, are essential attributes of the Self, we have also proved before. The conclusion, therefore, is that to be a knowing subject is the essential character of the Self. And that Self is of atomic size. The text &amp;lsquo;when he has departed there is no consciousness&amp;rsquo; (sa_mgñ_ā; B_ri._ Up. II, 4, 12) does not declare that the released Self has no consciousness; but only that in the case of that Self there is absent that knowledge (experience) of birth, death, and so on, which in the Saṁsāra state is caused by the connexion of the Self with the elements- as described in the preceding passage, &amp;rsquo;that great being having risen from out these elements again perishes after them.&amp;rsquo; For the text as to the absence of sa_mgñ_ā after death must be interpreted in harmony with other texts describing the condition of the released soul, such as &amp;rsquo;the seeing one does not see death nor illness nor pain; the seeing one sees everything and obtains everything everywhere&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;Kh.&lt;/em&gt; Up. VII, 25, 2); &amp;rsquo;not remembering that body&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;32&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There would result permanent consciousness or non-consciousness, or else limitative restriction to either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other view, i.e. on the view of the Self being omnipresent and mere knowledge, it would follow either that consciousness and also non-consciousness would permanently take place together everywhere; or else that there would be definite permanent restriction to either of the two, i.e. either permanent consciousness or permanent non-consciousness.&amp;ndash;If the omnipresent Self, consisting of mere knowledge only, were the cause of all that actual consciousness and non-consciousness on the part of Selfs which takes place in the world, it might be conceived either as the cause of both&amp;ndash;i.e. consciousness and non-consciousness&amp;ndash;and this would mean that there is everywhere and at all times simultaneous consciousness and non-consciousness. If, on the other hand, it were the cause of consciousness only, there would never and nowhere be unconsciousness of anything; and if it were the cause of non-consciousness only, there would never and nowhere be consciousness of anything. On our view, on the other hand, the actually perceived distribution of consciousness and non-consciousness explains itself, since we hold the Self to abide within bodies only, so that naturally consciousness takes place there only, not anywhere else.&amp;ndash;The view, finally (held by the Vaiśeshikas), of the consciousness of the Self depending on its organs (mind, senses, &amp;amp;c.; while the omnipresent Self is, apart from those organs, non-sentient, jaḍa), results in the same difficulties as the view criticised above; for as all the Selfs are omnipresent they are in permanent conjunction with all organs; and moreover it would follow that the adr̥shṭas (due to the actions of the different bodies) could&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;33&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(The soul is) an agent, on account of Scripture (thus) having a purport.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that the individual Self is a knowing subject and atomic. Now the question arises whether that Self is an agent or, being itself non-active, erroneously ascribes to itself the activity of the non-sentient guṇas. The primā facie answer is that the individual Self is not an agent, since the sacred texts concerned with the Self declare that the Self does not act, while the guṇas do act. Thus, e.g. in the Kaṭḥavallī, where the text at first denies of the individual Self all the attributes of Prakr̥ti, such as being born, ageing and dying (&amp;lsquo;he is not born, he does not die&amp;rsquo;), and then also denies that the Self is the agent in acts such as killing and the like, &amp;lsquo;If the slayer thinks that he slays, if the slain thinks that he is slain, they both do not understand; for this one does not slay, nor is that one slain&amp;rsquo; (I, 2, 19). This means&amp;ndash;if one thinks the Self to be the slayer one does not know the Self. And the Lord himself teaches that non-agency is the essential nature of the individual soul, and that it is mere delusion on the Self&amp;rsquo;s part to ascribe to itself agency. &amp;lsquo;By the attributes (guṇa) of Prakr̥ti, actions are wrought all round.&amp;rsquo; He who is deluded by self-conceit thinks &amp;lsquo;I am the agent&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;when the seer beholds no other agent than the guṇas&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;Prakr̥ti is said to be the cause of all agency of causes and effects, whilst the soul is the cause of all enjoyment of pleasure and pain&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. III, 27; XIV, 19; XIII, 20).&amp;ndash;The soul, therefore, is an enjoyer only, while all agency belongs to Prakr̥ti&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies, &amp;lsquo;an agent, on account of Scripture thus having a meaning.&amp;rsquo; The Self only is an agent, not the guṇas, because thus only Scripture has a meaning. For the scriptural injunctions, such as &amp;lsquo;he who desires the heavenly world is to sacrifice,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;He who desires Release is to meditate on Brahman,&amp;rsquo; and similar ones, enjoin action on him only who will enjoy the fruit&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. II, 1, 18), i.e. it teaches that the Self is active in taking to itself the prāṇas and moving about in the body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If not so, there would be change of grammatical expression.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because in the text &amp;lsquo;Knowledge performs the sacrifice, it performs all works&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 5) the Self is designated as the agent in all worldly and Vedic works, for this reason also the Self must be held to be an agent. And should it be said that the word &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; in that text denotes not the Self, but the internal organ or buddhi, we point out that in that case there would be a change of grammatical expression, that is to say, as the buddhi is the instrument of action, the text would exhibit the instrumental case instead of the nominative case &amp;lsquo;by knowledge, and so on&amp;rsquo; (vijñānena instead of vijñānam).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sūtra 32 has declared that if the Self were all-pervading it would follow that there would be no definite determination with regard to consciousness. Similarly, if the Self were not an agent but all activity belonged to Prakr̥ti it would follow that as Prakr̥ti is a common possession of all souls, all actions would result in enjoyment (experience) on the part of all souls, or else on the part of none; for as each Self is held to be omnipresent, they are all of them in equal proximity to all parts of the Pradhāna. For the same reason it could not be maintained that the distribution of results between the different souls depends on the different internal organs which are joined to the souls; for if the souls are omnipresent, no soul will be exclusively connected with any particular internal organ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if this were so, there would be no longer any proof for the existence of the Self; for they expressly teach that &amp;rsquo;the person (i.e. the soul) exists, on account of the fact of enjoyment.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But that state consists therein that the meditating being realises its difference from Prakr̥ti, and this is a conception which Prakr̥ti itself (of which the internal organ is only a modification) cannot form. The Self alone, therefore, is the agent. But this would imply that the activity of the Self is never at rest! Of this difficulty the next Sūtra disposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Just as a carpenter, although having his axe and other implements ready at hand, works or does not work just as he pleases. If the internal organ, on the contrary, were essentially active, it would constantly be acting, since as a non-intelligent being it could not be influenced by particular reasons for action, such as the desire for enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is free; for if it were dependent on the highest Self, the whole body of scriptural injunctions and prohibitions would be unmeaning.

In this way (i.e. since the action primarily depends on the volitional effort of the soul) injunctions and prohibitions are not devoid of meaning. The &amp;lsquo;and the rest&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra is meant to suggest the grace and punishments awarded by the Lord.&amp;ndash;The case is analogous to that of property of which two men are joint owners. If one of these wishes to transfer that property to a third person he cannot do so without the permission of his partner, but that that permission is given is after all his own doing, and hence the fruit of the action (reward or anything) properly belongs to him only.&amp;ndash;That, in the case of evil&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The following question now arises&amp;ndash;Is the individual soul absolutely different from Brahman? or is it nothing else than Brahman itself in so far as under the influence of error? or is it Brahman in so far as determined by a limiting adjunct (upādhi)? or is it a part (aṁsa) of Brahman?&amp;ndash;The doubt on this point is due to the disagreement of the scriptural texts.&amp;ndash;But this whole matter has already been decided under Sū. II, 1, 22.&amp;ndash;True. But as a difficulty presents itself on the ground of the conflicting nature of the texts&amp;ndash;some asserting the difference and some the unity of the individual soul and Brahman&amp;ndash;the matter is here more specially decided by its being proved that the soul is a part of Brahman. As long as this decision remains unsettled, the conclusions arrived at under the two Sūtras referred to, viz. that the soul is non-different from Brahman and that Brahman is &amp;lsquo;additional&amp;rsquo; to the soul, are without a proper basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 12, 6)&amp;ndash;on account of this mantra also the soul must be held to be a part of Brahman. For the word &amp;lsquo;foot&amp;rsquo; denotes a part. As the individual souls are many the mantra uses the plural form &amp;lsquo;all beings.&amp;rsquo; In the Sūtra (42) the word &amp;lsquo;part&amp;rsquo; is in the singular, with a view to denote the whole class. For the same reason in II, 3, 18 also the word &amp;lsquo;atman&amp;rsquo; is in the singular. For that the individual Selfs are different from the Lord, and are many and eternal, is declared by texts such as &amp;lsquo;He who, eternal and intelligent, fulfils the desires of many who likewise are eternal and intelligent&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13). Since thus the plurality of the eternal individual Selfs rests on good authority, those who have an insight into the true nature of Selfs will discern without difficulty different characteristics distinguishing the individual Selfs, although all Selfs are alike in so far as having intelligence for their essential nature. Moreover the Sūtra II, 3, 48 directly states the plurality of the individual Selfs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Gī. XV, 7). For this reason also the soul must be held to be a part of Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if the soul is a part of Brahman, all the imperfections of the soul are Brahman&amp;rsquo;s also!

Not so is the highest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; discards the objection. &amp;lsquo;Like light and so on.&amp;rsquo; The individual soul is a part of the highest Self; as the light issuing from a luminous thing such as fire or the sun is a part of that body; or as the generic characteristics of a cow or horse, and the white or black colour of things so coloured, are attributes and hence parts of the things in which those attributes inhere; or as the body is a part of an embodied being. For by a part we understand that which constitutes one place (deśa) of some thing, and hence a distinguishing attribute (viśeshṇa) is a part of the thing distinguished by that attribute. Hence those analysing a thing of that kind discriminate between the &lt;em&gt;distinguishing&lt;/em&gt; clement or part of it, and the &lt;em&gt;distinguished&lt;/em&gt; element or part. Now although the distinguishing attribute and the thing distinguished thereby stand to each other in the relation of part and whole, yet we observe them to differ in essential character. Hence there is no contradiction between the individual and the highest Self&amp;ndash;the former of which is a viśeshaṇa of the latter&amp;ndash;standing to each other in the relation of part and whole, and their being at the same time of essentially different nature. This the Sūtra declares &amp;rsquo;not so is the highest,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the highest Self is not of the same nature as the individual soul. For as the luminous body is of a nature different from that of its light, thus the highest Self differs from the individual soul which is a part of it. It is this difference of character&amp;ndash;due to the individual soul being the distinguishing clement and the highest Self being the substance distinguished thereby&amp;ndash;to which all those texts refer which declare difference. Those texts, on the other hand, which declare non-difference are&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For this reason there is no confusion or mixing up of the individual spheres of enjoyment and experience. The Sūtrakāra introduces this reference to an advantage of his own view of things, in order to intimate that the views of the soul being Brahman deluded or else Brahman affected by a limiting adjunct are on their part incapable of explaining how it is that the experiences of the individual Self and the highest Self, and of the several individual Selfs, are not mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;50&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the non-determination of the adr̥shṭas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the adr̥shṭas also which are the causes of the series of upādhis have for their substrate Brahman itself, there is no reason for their definite allotment(to definite individual souls), and hence again there is no definite separation of the spheres of experience. For the limiting adjuncts as well as the adr̥shṭas cannot by their connexion with Brahman split up Brahman itself which is essentially one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;51&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And it is thus also in the case of purposes and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason there can be no definite restriction in the case of purposes and so on which are the causes of the,different adr̥shṭas. (For they also cannot introduce plurality into Brahman that is fundamentally one.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;52&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said (that that is possible) owing to the difference of place; we deny this, on account of (all upādhis) being within (all places).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although Brahman is one only and not to be split by the several limiting adjuncts with which it is connected,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;yet the separation of the spheres of enjoyment is not impossible since the places of Brahman which are connected with the upādhis are distinct.&amp;ndash;This the Sūtra negatives on the ground that, as the upādhis move here and there and hence all places enter into connexion with all upādhis, the mixing up of spheres of enjoyment cannot be avoided. And even if the upādhis were connected with different places, the pain connected with some particular place would affect the whole of Brahman which is one only.&amp;ndash;The two Sūtras II, 3, 32 and 37 have stated an objection against those who, without taking their stand on the Veda, held the view of an all-pervading soul. The Sūtras II, 3, 50 and ff., on the other hand, combat the view of those who, while basing their doctrine on the Veda, teach the absolute unity of the Self.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the part.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
