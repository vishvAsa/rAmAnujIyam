50. On account of the non-determination of the adr̥shṭas.

As the adr̥shṭas also which are the causes of the series of upādhis have for their substrate Brahman itself, there is no reason for their definite allotment(to definite individual souls), and hence again there is no definite separation of the spheres of experience. For the limiting adjuncts as well as the adr̥shṭas cannot by their connexion with Brahman split up Brahman itself which is essentially one.
