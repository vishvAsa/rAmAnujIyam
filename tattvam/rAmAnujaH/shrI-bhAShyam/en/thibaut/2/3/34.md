34. On account of taking and the declaration as to its moving about.

The text beginning 'And as a great king,' &c., declares that 'the Self taking the pranas moves about in its own body,

according to its pleasure' (Br̥. Up. II, 1, 18), i.e. it teaches that the Self is active in taking to itself the prāṇas and moving about in the body.
