47. Permission and exclusion (result) from connexion with a body; as in the case of light and so on.

Although all souls are essentially of the same nature in so far as they are parts of Brahman, knowing subjects and so on, the permissions and exclusions referred to are possible for the reason that each individual soul is joined to some

particular body, pure or impure, whether of a Brāhmaṇa or Kshattriya or Vaiśya or Śūdra, and so on. 'As in the case of fire and so on.' All fire is of the same kind, and yet one willingly fetches fire from the house of a Brāhmaṇa, while one shuns fire from a place where dead bodies are burnt. And from a Brāhmaṇa one accepts food without any objection, while one refuses food from a low person.
