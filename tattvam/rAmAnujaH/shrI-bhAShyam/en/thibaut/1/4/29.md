29. Herewith all (texts) are explained, explained.

Hereby, i.e. by the whole array of arguments set forth in the four p훮das of the first adhy훮ya; all those particular passages of the Ved훮nta-texts which give instruction as to the cause of the world, are explained as meaning to set forth a Brahman all-wise, all-powerful, different in nature from all beings intelligent and non-intelligent. The repetition of the word 'explained' is meant to indicate the termination of the adhy훮ya.
