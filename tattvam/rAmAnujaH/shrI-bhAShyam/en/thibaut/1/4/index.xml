      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fourth-pāda&#34;&gt;FOURTH PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that some (mention) that which rests on Inference; we deny this because (the form) refers to what is contained in the simile of the body; and (this the text) shows.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far the Sūtras have given instruction about a Brahman, the enquiry into which serves as a means to obtain what is the highest good of man, viz. final release; which is the cause of the origination, and so on, of the world; which differs in nature from all non-sentient things such as the Pradhāna, and from all intelligent beings whether in the state of bondage or of release; which is free from all shadow of imperfection; which is all knowing, all powerful, has the power of realising all its purposes, comprises within itself all blessed qualities, is the inner Self of all, and possesses unbounded power and might. But here a new special objection presents itself. In order to establish the theory maintained by Kapila, viz. of there being a Pradhāna and individual souls which do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have their Self in Brahman, it is pointed out by some that in certain branches of the Veda there are met with certain passages which appear to adumbrate the doctrine of the Pradhāna being the universal cause. The Sūtras now apply themselves to the refutation of this view, in order thereby to confirm the theory of Brahman being the only cause of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the subtle (body), on account of its capability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The elements in their fine state are what is called the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved,&amp;rsquo; and this entering into a particular condition becomes the body. It is the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved&amp;rsquo; in the particular condition of the body, which in the text under discussion is called the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;On account of its capability,&amp;rsquo; i.e. because Unevolved non-sentient matter, when assuming certain states and forms, is capable of entering on activities promoting the interest of man. But, an objection is raised, if the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved&amp;rsquo; is taken to be matter in its subtle state, what objection is there to our accepting for the explanation of our text that which is established in the Sānkhya-system? for there also the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved&amp;rsquo; means nothing else but matter in its subtle state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To this the next Sūtra replies&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Matter in its subtle state) subserves an end, on account of its dependence on him (viz. the Supreme Person).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matter in its subtle state subserves ends, in so far only as it is dependent on the Supreme Person who is the cause of all. We by no means wish to deny unevolved matter and all its effects in themselves, but in so far only as they are maintained not to have their Self in the Supreme Person. For the fact is that they constitute his body and He thus constitutes their Self; and it is only through this their relation to him that the Pradhāna, and so on, are capable of accomplishing their several ends. Otherwise the different essential natures of them all could never&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now our text does not refer to the Un-evolved as an object of knowledge, and it cannot therefore be the Pradhāna assumed by the Sānkhyas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that (the text) declares (it); we say, not so; for the intelligent Self (is meant), on account of subject-matter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;He who has meditated on that which is without sound, without touch, without form, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell, without beginning, without end, beyond the Great, unchangeable; is freed from the jaws of death&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 3,15), this scriptural text, closely following on the text under discussion, represents the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved&amp;rsquo; as the object of knowledge!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. What that śloka represents as the object of meditation is (not the Unevolved but) the intelligent Self, i.e. the Supreme Person. For it is the latter who forms the general subject-matter, as we infer from two preceding passages, viz. &amp;lsquo;He who has knowledge for his charioteer, and who holds the reins of the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, the highest place of Vishṇu&amp;rsquo;; and &amp;lsquo;That Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect.&amp;rsquo; For this reason, also, the clause &amp;lsquo;Higher than the person there is nothing&amp;rsquo; cannot be taken as meant to deny the existence of an entity beyond the &amp;lsquo;purusha&amp;rsquo; in the Sānkhya sense. That the highest Self possesses the qualities of being without sound, &amp;amp;c., we moreover know from other scriptural texts, such as Mu. Up. I, 1, 6 &amp;lsquo;That which is not to be seen, not to be grasped,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. And the qualification &amp;lsquo;beyond the Great, unchangeable&amp;rsquo; is meant to declare that the highest Self is beyond the individual Self which had been called &amp;rsquo;the Great&amp;rsquo; in a previous passage &amp;lsquo;beyond the intellect is the Great Self.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And of three only there is this mention and question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Upanishad under discussion there is mention&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;made of three things only as objects of knowledge&amp;ndash;the three standing to one another in the relation of means, end to be realised by those means, and persons realising,&amp;ndash;and questions are asked as to those three only. There is no mention of, nor question referring to, the Unevolved.&amp;ndash;Naciketas desirous of Release having been allowed by Death to choose three boons, chooses for his first boon that his father should be well disposed towards him&amp;ndash;without which he could not hope for spiritual welfare. For his second boon he chooses the knowledge of the Naciketa-fire, which is a means towards final Release. &amp;lsquo;Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice which leads to heaven; tell it to me, full of faith. Those who live in the heaven-world reach Immortality&amp;ndash;this I ask as my second boon.&amp;rsquo; The term &amp;lsquo;heaven-world&amp;rsquo; here denotes the highest aim of man, i.e. Release, as appears from the declaration that those who live there enjoy freedom from old age and death; from the fact that further on (I, 1, 26) works leading to perishable results are disparaged; and from what Yama says in reply to the second demand &amp;lsquo;He who thrice performs this Nāciketa-rite overcomes birth and death.&amp;rsquo; As his third boon he, in the form of a question referring to final release, actually enquires about three things, viz. &amp;rsquo;the nature of the end to be reached, i.e. Release; the nature of him who wishes to reach that end; and the nature of the means to reach it, i.e. of meditation assisted by certain works. Yama, having tested Naciketas&amp;rsquo; fitness to receive the desired instruction, thereupon begins to teach him. &amp;lsquo;The Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has entered inLo the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss; having known him as God, by means of meditation on his Self, the wise one leaves joy and sorrow behind.&amp;rsquo; Here the clause &amp;lsquo;having known the God,&amp;rsquo; points to the divine Being that is to be meditated upon; the clause &amp;lsquo;by means of meditation on his Self points to the attaining agent, i.e. the individual soul as an object of knowledge; and the clause &amp;lsquo;having known him the wise ones leave joy and sorrow behind&amp;rsquo; points to the meditation through which Brahman is to be reached. Naciketas, pleased with the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For that they exist in this latter relation is proved by Scripture as well as Smr̥ti.&amp;ndash;A text of the followers of the Atharvan runs as follows: &amp;lsquo;Her who produces all effects, the non-knowing one, the unborn one, wearing eight forms, the firm one&amp;ndash;she is known (by the Lord) and ruled by him, she is spread out and incited and ruled by him, gives birth to the world for the benefit of the souls. A cow she is without beginning and end, a mother producing all beings; white, black, and red, milking all wishes for the Lord. Many babes unknown drink her. the impartial one;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. X, 4, 16); &amp;lsquo;That light which shines beyond heaven&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.

There is no contradiction between the Prakr̥ti being ajā and originating from light. On account of instruction being given about the formation (kalpana), i.e. creation of the world. This interpretation of &amp;lsquo;kalpana&amp;rsquo; is in agreement with the use of the verb klip in the text, &amp;lsquo;as formerly the creator made (akalpayat) sun and moon.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the diversity and of the excess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Vājasaneyins read in their text &amp;lsquo;He in whom the five &amp;ldquo;five-people&amp;rdquo; and the ether rest, him alone I believe to be the Self; I, who know, believe him to be Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 17). The doubt here arises whether this text be meant to set forth the categories as established in Kapila&amp;rsquo;s doctrine, or not.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former view, on the ground that the word &amp;lsquo;five-people,&amp;rsquo; qualified by the word &amp;lsquo;five,&amp;rsquo; intimates the twenty-five categories of the Sānkhyas. The compound &amp;lsquo;five-people&amp;rsquo; (pañcajanāḥ) denotes groups of five beings, just as the term pañca-pūlyaḥ denotes aggregates of five bundles of grass. And as we want to know how many such groups there are, the additional qualification &amp;lsquo;five&amp;rsquo; intimates that there are five such groups; just as if it were said &amp;lsquo;five five-bundles, i. e. five aggregates consisting of five bundles each.&amp;rsquo; We thus understand that the &amp;lsquo;five five-people&amp;rsquo; are twenty-five things, and as the mantra in which the term is met with refers to final release, we recognise the twenty-five categories known from the Sānkhya-smr̥ti which are here referred to as objects to be known by persons desirous of release. For the followers of Kapila teach that &amp;rsquo;there is the fundamental causal substance which is not an effect. There are seven things, viz. the Mahat, and so on, which are causal substances as well as effects. There are sixteen effects. The soul is neither a causal substance nor an effect&amp;rsquo; (Sān. Kā. 3). The mantra therefore is meant to intimate the categories known from the Sānkhya.&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies that from the mention of the number twenty-five supposed to be implied in the expression &amp;rsquo;the five five-people,&amp;rsquo; it does not follow that the categories of the Sānkhyas are meant. &amp;lsquo;On account of the diversity,&amp;rsquo; i.e. on account of the five-people further qualified by the number five being different from the categories of the Sānkhyas. For in the text &amp;lsquo;in whom the five five-people and the ether rest,&amp;rsquo; the &amp;lsquo;in whom&amp;rsquo; shows the five-people to have their abode, and hence their Self, in Brahman; and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By light, food not being (mentioned in the text) of some.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the text of some, viz. the Kāṇvas, where food is not mentioned, the five-people are recognised to be the five senses, owing to the phrase &amp;lsquo;of lights&amp;rsquo; which is met with in another complementary passage. In the mantra, &amp;lsquo;him the gods worship as the light of lights,&amp;rsquo; which precedes the mantra about the &amp;lsquo;five-people,&amp;rsquo; Brahman is spoken of as the light of lights, and this suggests the idea of certain lights the activity of which depends on Brahman. The mantra leaves it undetermined what these lights are; but from what follows about the &amp;lsquo;five-people,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., we learn that what is meant are the senses which light up as it were their respective objects. In &amp;rsquo;the breath of breath&amp;rsquo; the second &amp;lsquo;breath&amp;rsquo; (in the genitive case) denotes the sense-organ of touch, as that organ is connected with air, and as the vital breath (which would otherwise suggest itself as the most obvious explanation of prāṇa) does not harmonise with the metaphorical term &amp;rsquo;light.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Of the eye&amp;rsquo; refers to the organ of sight; &amp;lsquo;of the ear&amp;rsquo; to the organ of hearing. &amp;lsquo;Of food&amp;rsquo; comprises the senses of smell and taste together: it denotes the sense of smell on the ground that that sense is connected with earth, which may be &amp;lsquo;food,&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of (Brahman) as described being declared to be the cause with regard to Ether, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here the philosopher who holds the Pradhāna to be the general cause comes forward with another objection. The Vedānta-texts, he says, do not teach that creation proceeds from one and the same agent only, and you therefore have no right to hold that Brahman is the sole cause of the world. In one place it is said that our world proceeded from &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Being only this was in the beginning&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 2, 1). In other places the world is said to have sprung from &amp;lsquo;Non-being&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Non-being indeed this was in the beginning&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7, i); and &amp;lsquo;Non-being only was this in the beginning; it became Being&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. III, 19, 1). As the Vedānta-texts are thus not consequent in their statements regarding the creator, we cannot conclude from them that Brahman is the sole cause of the world. On the other hand, those texts do enable us to conclude that the Pradhāna only is the universal cause. For the text &amp;lsquo;Now all this was then undeveloped&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 4, 7) teaches that the world was merged in the undeveloped Pradhāna. and the subsequent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From connexion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Brahman intelligent, consisting of bliss, &amp;amp;c., connects itself also with the passage &amp;lsquo;Non-being was this in the beginning&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7). For the section of the text which precedes that passage (viz. &amp;lsquo;Different from this Self consisting of understanding is the Self consisting of Bliss;&amp;ndash;he wished, may I be many;&amp;ndash;he created all whatever there is. Having created he entered into it; having entered it he became sat and tyat&amp;rsquo;) clearly refers to Brahman consisting of Bliss, which realises its purposes, creates all beings, and entering into them is the Self of all. When, therefore, after this we meet with the.śloka (&amp;lsquo;Non-being this was in the beginning&amp;rsquo;) introduced by the words &amp;lsquo;On this there is also this śloka&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which shows that the śloka is meant to throw light on what precedes; and when further or we have the passage &amp;lsquo;From fear of it the wind blows&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., which, referring to the same Brahman, predicates of it universal rulership, bliss of nature, and so on; we conclude with certainty that the śloka about &amp;lsquo;Non-being&amp;rsquo; also refers to Brahman. As during a pralaya the distinction of names and forms does not exist, and Brahman also then does not exist in so far as connected with names and forms, the text applies to Brahman the term &amp;lsquo;Non-being.&amp;rsquo; The text &amp;lsquo;Non-being only this was in the beginning&amp;rsquo; explains itself in the same way.&amp;ndash;Nor can we admit&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because it denotes the world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sānkhya comes forward with a further objection. Although the Vedānta-texts teach an intelligent principle to be the cause of the world, they do not present to us as objects of knowledge anything that could be the cause of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the world, apart from the Pradhāna and the soul as established by the Sānkhya-system. For the Kaushītakins declare in their text, in the dialogue of Bālāki and Ajātaśatru, that none but the enjoying(individual) soul is to be known as the cause of the world, &amp;lsquo;Shall I tell you Brahman? He who is the maker of those persons and of whom this is the work (or &amp;ldquo;to whom this work belongs&amp;rdquo;) he indeed is to be known&amp;rsquo; (Kau. Up. IV, 19). Bālāki at the outset proposes Brahman as the object of instruction, and when he is found himself not to know Brahman, Ajātaśatru instructs him about it, &amp;lsquo;he indeed is to be known.&amp;rsquo; But from the relative clause &amp;rsquo;to whom this work belongs,&amp;rsquo; which connects the being to be known with work, we infer that by Brahman we have here to understand the enjoying soul which is the ruler of Prakr̥ti, not any other being. For no other being is connected with work; work, whether meritorious or the contrary, belongs to the individual soul only. Nor must you contest this conclusion on the ground that &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; is here to be explained as meaning the object of activity, so that the sense of the clause would be &amp;lsquo;he of whom this entire world, as presented by perception and the other means of knowledge, is the work.&amp;rsquo; For in that case the separate statements made in the two clauses, &amp;lsquo;who is the maker of those persons&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;of whom this is the work,&amp;rsquo; would be devoid of purport(the latter implying the former). Moreover, the generally accepted meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;karman,&amp;rsquo; both in Vedic and worldly speech, is work in the sense of good and evil actions. And as the origination of the world is caused by actions of the various individual souls, the designation of &amp;lsquo;maker of those persons&amp;rsquo; also suits only the individual soul. The meaning of the whole passage therefore is &amp;lsquo;He who is the cause of the different persons that have their abode in the disc of the sun, and so on, and are instrumental towards the retributive experiences of the individual souls; and to whom there belongs karman, good and evil, to which there is due his becoming such a cause; ḥe indeed is to be known, &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; essential nature is to be cognised in distinction from Prakr̥ti.&amp;rsquo; And also in what follows, &amp;lsquo;The two came to a person who was asleep. He&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that this is not so on account of the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air; we reply that this has been explained before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With reference to the plea urged by the Pūrvapakshin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that, owing to inferential marks pointing to the individual soul, and the circumstance of mention being made of the chief vital air, we must decide that the section treats of the enjoying individual soul and not of the highest Self, the Sūtra remarks that this argumentation has already been disposed of, viz. in connexion with the Pratardana vidyā. For there it was shown that when a text is ascertained, on the ground of a comprehensive survey of initial and concluding clauses, to refer to Brahman, all inferential marks which point to other topics must be interpreted so as to fall in with the principal topic. Now in our text Brahman is introduced at the outset &amp;lsquo;Shall I tell you Brahman?&amp;rsquo; it is further mentioned in the middle of the section, for the clause &amp;lsquo;of whom this is the work&amp;rsquo; does not refer to the soul in general but to the highest Person who is the cause of the whole world; and at the end again we hear of a reward which connects itself only with meditations on Brahman, viz. supreme sovereignty preceded by the conquest of all evil. &amp;lsquo;Having overcome all evil he obtains pre-eminence among all beings, sovereignty and supremacy&amp;ndash;yea, he who knows this.&amp;rsquo; The section thus being concerned with Brahman, the references to the individual soul and to the chief vital air must also be interpreted so as to fall in with Brahman. In the same way it was shown above that the references to the individual soul and the chief vital air which are met with in the Pratardana vidyā really explain themselves in connexion with a threefold meditation on Brahman. As in the passage &amp;lsquo;Then with this prāṇa alone he becomes one&amp;rsquo; the two words &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;prāṇa&amp;rsquo; may be taken as co-ordinated and it hence would be inappropriate to separate them (and to explain &amp;lsquo;in the prāṇa which abides in this soul&amp;rsquo;), and as the word &amp;lsquo;prāṇa&amp;rsquo; is ascertained to mean Brahman also, we must understand the mention of prāṇa to be made with a view to meditation on Brahman in so far as having the prāṇa for its body. But how can the references to the individual soul be put in connexion with Brahman?&amp;ndash;This point is taken up by the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But Jaimini thinks that it has another purport,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;on account of the question and answer; and thus some also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to preclude the idea that the mention made of the individual soul enables us to understand the whole section as concerned with that soul.&amp;ndash;The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the mention made of the individual soul has another meaning, i.e. aims at conveying the idea of what is different from the individual soul, i.e. the nature of the highest Brahman. &amp;lsquo;On account of question and answer.&amp;rsquo; According to the story told in the Upanishad, Ajātaśatru leads Bālāki to where a sleeping man is resting, and convinces him that the soul is different from breath, by addressing the sleeping person, in whom breath only is awake, with names belonging to prāṇa &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; without the sleeper being awaked thereby, and after that rousing him by a push of his staff. Then, with a view to teaching Bālāki the difference of Brahman from the individual soul, he asks him the following questions: &amp;lsquo;Where, O Bālāki, did this person here sleep? Where was he? Whence did he thus come back?&amp;rsquo; To these questions he thereupon himself replies, &amp;lsquo;When sleeping he sees no dream, then he becomes one in that prāṇa alone.&amp;ndash;From that Self the organs proceed each towards its place, from the organs the gods, from the gods the worlds.&amp;rsquo; Now this reply, no less than the questions, clearly refers to the highest Self as something different from the individual Self. For that entering into which the soul, in the state of deep sleep, attains its true nature and enjoys complete serenity, being free from the disturbing experiences of pleasure and pain that accompany the states of waking and of dream; and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the connected meaning of the sentences.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the conclusion arrived at there may remain a suspicion that here and there in the Upanishads texts are to be met with which aim at setting forth the soul as maintained in Kapila&amp;rsquo;s system, and that hence there is no room for a being different from the individual soul and called Lord. This suspicion the Sūtra undertakes to remove, in connexion with the Maitreyi-brāhmaṇa, in the Br̥hadaraṇyaka. There we read &amp;lsquo;Verily, a husband is dear, not for the love of the husband, but for the love of the Self a husband is dear, and so on. Everything is dear, not for the love of everything, but for the love of the Self everything is dear. The Self should be seen, should be heard, should be reflected on, should be meditated upon. When the Self has been seen, heard, reflected upon, meditated upon, then all this is known&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 5, 6).&amp;ndash;Here the doubt arises whether the Self enjoined in this passage as the object of seeing, &amp;amp;c., be the soul as held by the Sānkhyas, or the Supreme Lord, all-knowing, capable of realising all his purposes, and so on. The Pūrvapakshin upholds the former alternative. For, he says, the beginning no less than the middle and the concluding part of the section conveys the idea of the individual soul only. In the beginning the individual soul only is meant, as appears from the connexion of the Self with husband, wife, children, wealth, cattle, and so on. This is confirmed by the middle part of the section where the Self is said to be connected with origination and destruction, &amp;lsquo;a mass of knowledge, he having risen from these elements vanishes again into them. When he has departed there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;20&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(It is) a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved; thus Āśmarathya thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the teacher Āśmarathya the circumstance that terms denoting the individual soul are used to denote Brahman is a mark enabling us to infer that the promissory declaration according to which through the knowledge of one thing everything is known is well established. If the individual soul were not identical with Brahman in so far as it is the effect of Brahman, then the knowledge of the soul&amp;ndash;being something distinct from Brahman&amp;ndash;would not follow from the knowledge of the highest Self. There are the texts declaring the oneness of Brahman previous to creation, such as &amp;rsquo;the Self only was this in the beginning&amp;rsquo; (Ait. Ār. II, 4, 1, 1), and on the other hand those texts which declare that the souls spring from and again are merged in Brahman; such as &amp;lsquo;As from a blazing fire sparks being like unto fire fly forth a thousandfold, thus are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable, and return thither also&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 1). These two sets of texts together make us apprehend that the souls are one with Brahman in so far as they are its effects. On this ground a word denoting the individual soul denotes the highest Self as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Auḍulomi thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is wrong to maintain that the designation of Brahman by means of terms denoting the individual soul is intended to prove the truth of the declaration that through the knowledge of one thing everything is known, in so far namely as the soul is an effect of Brahman and hence one with it. For scriptural texts such as &amp;rsquo;the knowing Self is not born, it dies not&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18), declare the soul not to have originated, and it moreover is admitted that the world is each time created to the end of the souls undergoing experiences retributive of their former deeds; otherwise the inequalities of the different parts of the creation would be inexplicable. If moreover the soul were a mere effect of Brahman, its Release would consist in a mere return into the substance of Brahman,&amp;ndash;analogous to the refunding into Brahman of the material elements, and that would mean that the injunction and performance of acts leading to such Release would be purportless. Release, understood in that sense, moreover would not be anything beneficial to man; for to be refunded into Brahman as an earthen vessel is refunded into its own causal substance, i.e. clay, means nothing else but complete annihilation. How, under these circumstances, certain texts can speak of the origination and reabsorption of the individual soul will be set forth later on.&amp;ndash;According to the opinion of the teacher Auḍulomi, the highest Selfs being denoted by terms directly denoting the individual soul is due to the soul&amp;rsquo;s becoming Brahman when departing from the body. This is in agreement with texts such as the following, &amp;lsquo;This serene being having risen from this body and approached the highest light appears in its true form&amp;rsquo; (Kḥ. Up. VIII, 3, 4); &amp;lsquo;As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is higher than the high&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;22&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of (Brahman&amp;rsquo;s) abiding (within the individual soul); thus Kāśakr̥tsna (holds).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We must object likewise to the view set forth in the preceding Sūtra, viz. that Brahman is denoted by terms denoting the individual soul because that soul when departing becomes one with Brahman. For that view cannot stand the test of being submitted to definite alternatives.&amp;ndash;Is the soul&amp;rsquo;s not being such, i.e. not being Brahman, previously to its departure from the body, due to its own essential nature or to a limiting adjunct, and is it in the latter case real or unreal? In the first case the soul can never become one with Brahman, for if its separation from Brahman is due to its own essential nature, that separation can never vanish as long as the essential nature persists. And should it be said that its essential nature comes to an end together with its distinction from Brahman, we reply that in that case it perishes utterly and does not therefore become Brahman. The latter view, moreover, precludes itself as in no way beneficial to man, and so on.&amp;ndash;If, in the next place, the difference of the soul from Brahman depends on the presence of real limiting adjuncts, the soul is Brahman even before its departure from the body, and we therefore cannot reasonably accept the distinction implied in saying that the soul becomes Brahman only when it departs. For on this view there exists nothing but Brahman and its limiting adjuncts, and as those adjuncts cannot introduce difference into Brahman which is without parts and hence incapable of difference, the difference resides altogether in the adjuncts, and hence the soul is Brahman even before its departure from the body.&amp;ndash;If, on the other hand, the difference due to the adjuncts is not real, we ask&amp;ndash;what is it then that becomes Brahman on the departure of the soul?&amp;ndash;Brahman itself whose true nature had previously been obscured by Nescience, its limiting adjunct!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. Of Brahman whose true nature consists in eternal, free, self-luminous intelligence, the true nature cannot possibly be hidden by Nescience. For by &amp;lsquo;hiding&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;obscuring&amp;rsquo; we understand the cessation of the light that belongs to the essential nature of a thing. Where, therefore, light itself and alone constitutes the essential nature of a thing, there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It must indeed be admitted, he says, that the Vedānta-texts teach the cause of the world to be an all-knowing Lord; for they attribute to that cause thought and similar characteristics. But at the same time we learn from those same texts that the material cause of the world is none other than the Pradhāna; with an all-knowing, unchanging superintending Lord they connect a Pradhāna,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;27&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Owing to modification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means&amp;ndash;owing to the essential nature of modification (pariṇāma). The modification taught in our system is not such as to introduce imperfections into the highest Brahman, on the contrary it confers on it limitless glory. For our teaching as to Brahman&amp;rsquo;s modification is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brahman&amp;ndash;essentially antagonistic to all evil, of uniform goodness, differing in nature from all beings other than itself, all-knowing, endowed with the power of immediately realising all its purposes, in eternal possession of all it wishes for, supremely blessed&amp;ndash;has for its body the entire universe, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings&amp;ndash;the universe being for it a plaything as it were&amp;ndash;and constitutes the Self of the Universe. Now, when this world which forms Brahman&amp;rsquo;s body has been gradually reabsorbed into Brahman, each constituent element being refunded into its immediate cause, so that in the end there remains only the highly subtle, elementary matter which Scripture calls Darkness; and when this so-called Darkness itself, by assuming a form so extremely subtle that it hardly deserves to be called something separate from Brahman, of which it constitutes the body, has become one with Brahman; then Brahman invested with this ultra-subtle body forms the resolve &amp;lsquo;May I again possess a world-body constituted by all sentient and non-sentient beings, distinguished by names and forms just as in the previous aeon,&amp;rsquo; and modifies (pariṇāmayati) itself by gradually evolving the world-body in the inverse order in which reabsorption had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;28&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And because it is called the womb.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brahman is the material as well as the operative cause of the world for that reason also that certain texts call it the womb, &amp;rsquo;the maker, the Lord, the Person, Brahman, the womb&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3); &amp;rsquo;that which the wise regard as the womb of all beings&amp;rsquo; (I, 1, 6). And that &amp;lsquo;womb&amp;rsquo; means as much as material cause, appears from the complementary passage &amp;lsquo;As a spider sends forth and draws in its threads&amp;rsquo; (I, 1, 7)&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Herewith all (texts) are explained, explained.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hereby, i.e. by the whole array of arguments set forth in the four pādas of the first adhyāya; all those particular passages of the Vedānta-texts which give instruction as to the cause of the world, are explained as meaning to set forth a Brahman all-wise, all-powerful, different in nature from all beings intelligent and non-intelligent. The repetition of the word &amp;rsquo;explained&amp;rsquo; is meant to indicate the termination of the adhyāya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
