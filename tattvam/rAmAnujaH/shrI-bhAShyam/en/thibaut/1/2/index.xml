      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Everywhere; because there is taught what is known.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read in the Cḥāndogya, &amp;lsquo;Man is made of thought; according to what his thought is in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life. Let him form this thought: he who consists of mind, whose body is breath, whose form is light,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (III, 14). We here understand that of the meditation enjoined by the clause &amp;rsquo;let him form this thought&amp;rsquo; the object is the being said to consist of mind, to have breath for its body, &amp;amp;c. A doubt, however, arises whether the being possessing these attributes be the individual soul or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, mind and breath are instruments of the individual soul; while the text &amp;lsquo;without breath, without mind,&amp;rsquo; distinctly denies them to the highest Self. Nor can the Brahman mentioned in a previous clause of the same section (&amp;lsquo;All this indeed is Brahman&amp;rsquo;) be connected as an object with the meditation enjoined in the passage under discussion; for Brahman is there referred to in order to suggest the idea of its being the Self of all&amp;ndash;which idea constitutes a means for bringing about that calmness of mind which is helpful towards the act of meditation enjoined in the clause &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate with calm mind,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. Nor, again, can it be said that as the meditation conveyed by the clause &amp;rsquo;let him form this thought&amp;rsquo; demands an object, Brahman, although mentioned in another passage, only admits of being connected with&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The highest Self can be apprehended only by a mind purified by meditation on that Self, such meditation being assisted by the seven means, viz. abstention, &amp;amp;c. (see above, p. 17). This intimates that the highest Self is of pure goodness, precluding all evil, and therefore different in nature from everything else; for by the impure minded impure objects only can be apprehended.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Having the vital breath for its body&amp;rsquo; means&amp;ndash;being the supporter of all life in the world.

It is not possible therefore to hold that the section under discussion should refer to the individual soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This shows that the soul which obtains is the person meditating, and the highest Brahman that is to be obtained, the object of meditation: Brahman, therefore, is something different from the attaining soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the difference of words.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The clause &amp;lsquo;That is the Self of me, within the heart&amp;rsquo; designates the embodied soul by means of a genitive form, while the object of meditation is exhibited in the nominative case. Similarly, a text of the Vājasaneyins, which treats of the same topic, applies different terms to the embodied and the highest Self, &amp;lsquo;Like a rice grain, or a barley grain, or a canary seed, or the kernel of a canary seed, thus that golden Person is within the Self&amp;rsquo; (Śat. Br. X, 6, 3, 2). Here the locative form, &amp;lsquo;within the Self,&amp;rsquo; denotes the embodied Self, and the nominative, &amp;rsquo;that golden Person,&amp;rsquo; the object to be meditated on.&amp;ndash;All this proves the highest Self to be the object of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Gi. XV, 15, 19; XVIII, 61). These Smr̥ti-texts show the embodied soul to be the meditating subject, and the highest Self the object of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that (the passage does) not&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(refer to Brahman) on account of the smallness of the abode, and on account of the denotation of that (viz. minuteness of the being meditated on); we say no, because (Brahman) has thus to be meditated upon, and because (in the same passage) it is said to be like ether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be contended that, as the text &amp;lsquo;he is my Self within the heart&amp;rsquo; declares the being meditated on to dwell within a minute abode, viz. the heart; and as moreover another text&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;smaller than a grain of rice,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., declares it to be itself of minute size, that being cannot be the highest Self, but only the embodied soul. For other passages speak of the highest Self as unlimited, and of the embodied soul as having the size of the point of a goad (cp. e.g. Mu. Up. I, 1, 6, and Śvet. Up. V, 8).&amp;ndash;This objection the Sūtra rebuts by declaring that the highest Self is spoken of as such, i.e. minute, on account of its having to be meditated upon as such. Such minuteness does not, however, belong to its true nature; for in the same section it is distinctly declared to be infinite like ether&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. III, 14, 3). This shows that the designation of the highest Self as minute is for the purpose of meditation only.&amp;ndash;The connexion of the whole section then is as follows. The clause &amp;lsquo;All this is Brahman; let a man meditate with calm mind on this world as beginning, ending, and breathing in Brahman,&amp;rsquo; enjoins meditation on Brahman as being the Self of all, in so far as it is the cause of the origin and destruction of all, and entering into all beings as their soul gives life to them. The next clause, &amp;lsquo;Man is made of thought; according as his thought is in this world, so will he be when he has departed this life,&amp;rsquo; declares the attainment of the desired object to depend on the nature of the meditation; and the following clause, &amp;lsquo;Let him therefore form the following thought,&amp;rsquo; thereupon repeats the injunction with a view to the declaration of details. The clause &amp;lsquo;He who consists of mind,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., up to &amp;lsquo;who is never surprised,&amp;rsquo; then&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition (of pleasure and pain); we reply, not so, on account of difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, if the highest Brahman is assumed to dwell within bodies, like the individual soul, it follows that, like the latter, it is subject to the experience of pleasure and pain, such experience springing from connexion with bodies!&amp;ndash;Of this objection the Sūtra disposes by remarking &amp;rsquo;not so, on account of difference (of reason).&amp;rsquo; For what is the cause of experiences, pleasurable or painful, is not the mere dwelling within a body, but rather the subjection to the influence of good and evil deeds; and such subjection is impossible in the case of the highest Self to which all evil is foreign. Compare the scriptural text &amp;lsquo;One of the two eats the sweet fruit, the other one looks on without eating&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The eater (is the highest Self) on account of there being taken all that is movable and immovable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read in the Kaṭḥavallī (I, 3, 25), &amp;lsquo;Who then knows where he is to whom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but food, and death itself a condiment? &amp;lsquo;A doubt here arises whether the &amp;rsquo;eater&amp;rsquo;, suggested by the words &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;condiment,&amp;rsquo; is the individual soul or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The individual soul, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for all enjoyment presupposes works, and works belong to the individual soul only.&amp;ndash;Of this view the Sūtra disposes. The &amp;rsquo;eater&amp;rsquo; can be the highest Self only, because the taking, i. e. eating, of the whole aggregate of movable and immovable things can be predicated of that Self only. &amp;lsquo;Eating&amp;rsquo; does not here mean fruition dependent on work, but rather the act of reabsorption of the world on the part of the highest Brahman, i. e. Vishṇu, who is the cause of the origination, subsistence, and final destruction of the universe. This appears from the fact that Vishṇu is mentioned in the same section, &amp;lsquo;He reaches the end of his journey, and that is the highest place of Vishṇu&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. I, 3, 9). Moreover the clause &amp;rsquo;to whom death is a condiment&amp;rsquo; shows that by the Brahmans and Kshattriyas, mentioned in the text, we have to understand the whole universe of moving and non-moving things, viewed as things to be consumed by the highest Self. For a condiment is a thing which, while itself being eaten, causes other things to be eaten; the meaning of the passage, therefore, is that while death itself is consumed, being a condiment as it were, there is at the same time eaten whatever is flavoured or made palatable by death, and that is the entire world of beings in which the Brahmans and Kshattriyas&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cp. &amp;lsquo;The wise who knows the Self as great and omnipresent does not grieve&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. I, 2, 22); &amp;lsquo;That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained; the Self chooses him as his own&amp;rsquo; (I, 2, 23).&amp;ndash;Moreover, the clause (forming part of the text under discussion),&amp;lsquo;Who knows him (i.e. the being which constitutes the topic of the section) where he is?&amp;rsquo; clearly shows that we have to recognise here the Self of which it had previously been said that it is hard to know unless it assists us with its grace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;rsquo;two entered into the cave&amp;rsquo; are the two Selfs; on account of this being seen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two, entered into the cave and drinking their reward, are neither the embodied soul together with the vital breath, nor the embodied soul together with the buddhi; it is rather the embodied Self and the highest Self which are designated by those terms. For this is seen, i.e. it is seen that in that section the individual Self and the highest Self only are spoken of as entered into the cave. To the highest Self there refers I, 2, 12, &amp;lsquo;The wise who by meditation on his Self recognises the Ancient who is difficult to see, who has entered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind.&amp;rsquo; And to the individual soul there refers I ,4, 7, &amp;lsquo;Who is together with the vital breath, who is Aditi, who is made of the deities, who entering into the cave abides therein, who was born variously through the elements.&amp;rsquo; Aditi here means the individual soul which enjoys (atti) the fruits of its works; which is associated with the vital breath; which is made of the deities, i.e. whose enjoyment is dependent on the different sense-organs; which abides in the hollow of the heart; and which, being connected with the elementary substances, earth, and so on, is born in various forms&amp;ndash;human, divine, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;That the text speaks of the two Selfs as drinking their reward (while actually the individual soul only does so) is to be understood in the same way as the phrase &amp;rsquo;there go the umbrella-bearers&amp;rsquo; (one of whom only carries the umbrella). Or else we may account for this on the ground that both are agents with regard to the drinking, in so far as the &amp;lsquo;drinking&amp;rsquo; individual soul is caused to drink by the highest Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of distinctive qualities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere in that section we meet with statements of distinctive attributes of the two Selfs, the highest Self&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;being represented as the object of meditation and attainment, and the individual Self as the meditating and attaining subject. The passage &amp;lsquo;When he has known and understood that which is born from Brahman, the intelligent, to be divine and venerable, then he obtains everlasting peace&amp;rsquo; (I, 1, 17) refers to the meditating individual soul which recognises itself as being of the nature of Brahman. On the other hand, I, 3, 2, &amp;lsquo;That which is a bridge for sacrificers. the highest imperishable Brahman for those who wish to cross over to the fearless shore, the Nāciketa, may we be able to know that,&amp;rsquo; refers to the highest Self as the object of meditation; &amp;lsquo;Nāciketa&amp;rsquo; here meaning that which is to be reached through the Nāciketa-rite. Again, the passage &amp;lsquo;Know the Self to be sitting in the chariot and the body to be the chariot&amp;rsquo; (I, 3, 3) refers to the meditating individual soul; and the verse, I, 3, 9, &amp;lsquo;But he who has understanding for his charioteer, and holds the reins of the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, and that is the highest place of Vishṇu.&amp;rsquo; refers to the embodied and the highest Selfs as that which attains and that which is to be attained. And in the text under discussion also (I, 3, 1), the two Selfs are distinctly designated as light and shade, the one being all-knowing, the other devoid of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(The Person) within the eye (is the highest Self) on account of suitability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cḥandogas have the following text: &amp;lsquo;The Person that is seen within the eye, that is the Self. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. IV, 15, 1). The doubt here arises whether the person that is here spoken of as abiding within the eye is the reflected Self, or some divine being presiding over the sense of sight, or the embodied Self, or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;It is the reflected Self, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for the text refers to the person seen as something well known, and the expression, &amp;lsquo;is seen,&amp;rsquo; clearly refers to something directly perceived. Or it may be the individual soul, for that also may be referred to as something well known, as it is in special connexion with the eye: people, by looking into the open eye of a person, determine whether the living soul remains in him or is departing. Or else we may assume that the Person seen within the eye is some particular divine being, on the strength of the scriptural text, Br̥. Up. V, 5, 2, &amp;lsquo;He (the person seen within the sun) rests with his rays in him (the person within the eye).&amp;rsquo; Any of these beings may quite suitably be referred to as something well known.&amp;ndash;Of these alternatives the Sūtra disposes by declaring that the Person within the eye is the highest Self. For the text goes on to say about the Person seen within the eye, &amp;lsquo;They call him Saṁyadvāma, for all blessings go towards him. He is also Vāmanī, for he leads all blessings. He is also Bhāmanī, for he shines in all worlds.&amp;rsquo; And all these attributes can be reconciled with the highest Self only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 7, 18, &amp;lsquo;He who dwells within the eye, who rules the eye within.&amp;rsquo; We therefore recognise that highest Self in the text, &amp;lsquo;That Person which is seen within the eye.&amp;rsquo; The argument founded on reference to &amp;lsquo;something well known&amp;rsquo; thus suits the highest Self very well; and also the clause which denotes immediate perception (&amp;lsquo;is seen&amp;rsquo;) appears quite suitable, since the highest Self is directly intuited by persons practising mystic concentration of mind (Yoga).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The topic of the whole section is Brahman characterised by delight, as indicated in the passage &amp;lsquo;Ka(pleasure) is Brahman, Kha(ether) is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. IV,10, 5). To that same Brahman the passage under discussion (&amp;lsquo;The Person that is seen in the eye&amp;rsquo;) refers for the purpose of enjoining first a place with which Brahman is to be connected in meditation, and secondly some special qualities&amp;ndash;such as comprising and leading all blessings&amp;ndash;to be attributed to Brahman in meditation.&amp;ndash;The word &amp;lsquo;only&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra indicates the independence of the argument set forth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For that very reason that (ether) is Brahman.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the clause &amp;lsquo;What is Ka the same is Kha&amp;rsquo; speaks of ether as characterised by pleasure, the ether which is denoted by &amp;lsquo;Kha&amp;rsquo; is no other than the highest Brahman. To explain. On the Fires declaring &amp;lsquo;Breath is Brahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,&amp;rsquo; Upakośala says, &amp;lsquo;I understand that breath is Brahman, but I do not understand Ka and Kha.&amp;rsquo; The meaning of this is as follows. The Fires cannot speak of meditation on Brahman under the form of breath and so on, because they are engaged in giving instruction to me, who am afraid of birth, old age, death, &amp;amp;c., and desirous of final Release. What they declare to me therefore is meditation on Brahman itself. Now here Brahman is exhibited in co-ordination with certain well-known things, breath and so on. That Brahman should be qualified by co-ordination with breath is suitable, either from the point of view of Brahman having the attribute of supporting the world, or on account of Brahman being the ruler of breath, which stands to it in the relation of a body. Hence Upakośala says, &amp;lsquo;I understand that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now this same way is described by the teacher to Upakosala in connexion with the instruction as to the Person in the eye, &amp;lsquo;They go to light, from light to day,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.

Of the reflected Self it cannot be said that it permanently abides within the eye, for its presence there depends on the nearness to the eye of another person. The embodied Self again has its seat within the heart, which is the root of all sense-organs, so as to assist thereby the activities of the different senses; it cannot therefore abide within the eye. And with regard to the divinity the text says that &amp;lsquo;he rests with his rays in him, i.e. the eye&amp;rsquo;: this implies that the divine being may preside over the organ of sight although itself abiding in another place; it does not therefore abide in the eye. Moreover, non-conditioned immortality and similar qualities cannot belong to any of these three Selfs. The Person seen within the eye therefore is the highest Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Neither of these can be the Ruler within, since the text states attributes which cannot possibly belong to either. For there is not even the shadow of a possibility that essential capability of seeing and ruling all things, and being the Self of all, and immortality should belong either to the non-sentient Pradhāna or to the individual soul.&amp;ndash;The last two Sūtras have declared that the mentioned qualities belong to the highest Self, while they do not belong to the individual soul. The next Sūtra supplies a new, independent argument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Mādhyandinas read, &amp;lsquo;He who dwells in the Self, whom the Self does not know,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.; the Kāṇvas, &amp;lsquo;He who dwells&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;within understanding&amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;c.

That which is invisible, unseizable, without origin and qualities, &amp;amp;c., that it is which the wise regard as the source of all beings&amp;rsquo;; and further on, &amp;lsquo;That which is higher than the high Imperishable&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5, 6; II, 1, 2). The doubt here arises whether the Indestructible, possessing the qualities of imperceptibility, &amp;amp;c., and that which is higher than the Indestructible, should be taken to denote the Pradhāna and the soul of the Sānkhyas, or whether both denote the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, while in the text last discussed there is mentioned a special attribute of an intelligent being, viz. in the clause &amp;lsquo;unseen but a seer&amp;rsquo;, no similar attribute is stated in the former of the two texts under discussion, and the latter text clearly describes the collective individual soul, which is higher than the imperishable Pradhāna, which itself is higher than all its effects. The reasons for this decision are as follows:&amp;ndash;Colour and so on reside in the gross forms of non-intelligent matter, viz. the elements, earth, and so on. When, therefore, visibility and so on are expressly negatived, such negation suggests a non-sentient thing cognate to earth, &amp;amp;c., but of a subtle kind, and such a thing is no other than the Pradhāna. And as something higher than this Pradhāna there are known the collective souls only, under whose guidance the Pradhāna gives birth to all its effects, from the so-called Mahat downwards&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then, the text proceeds, in order to obtain this knowledge of Brahman, which had been handed down through a succession of teachers to Angiras, Śaunaka approached Angiras respectfully and asked him: &amp;lsquo;What is that through which, if known, all this is known?&amp;rsquo; i.e. since all knowledge is founded on the knowledge of Brahman, he enquires after the nature of Brahman. Angiras replies that he who wishes to attain Brahman must acquire two kinds of knowledge, both of them having Brahman for their object: an indirect one which springs from the study of the śāstras, viz. the Veda, Śikshā, Kalpa, and so on, and a direct one which springs from concentrated meditation (yoga). The latter kind of knowledge is the means of obtaining Brahman, and it is of the nature of devout meditation (bhakti), as characterised in the text &amp;lsquo;He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained&amp;rsquo; (III, 2, 3). The means again towards this kind of knowledge is such knowledge as is gained from sacred tradition, assisted by abstention and the other six auxiliary means (sec above, p. 17); in agreement with the text, &amp;lsquo;Him the Brahmattas seek to know by the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22).&amp;ndash;Thus the Reverend Parāśara also says, &amp;lsquo;The cause of attaining him is knowledge and work, and knowledge is twofold, according as it is based on sacred tradition or springs from discrimination.&amp;rsquo; The Muṇḍaka-tcxt refers to the inferior kind of knowledge in the passage &amp;rsquo;the lower knowledge is the R̥g-veda,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., up to &amp;lsquo;and the dharma- śāstras&amp;rsquo;; this knowledge is the means towards the intuition of Brahman; while the higher kind of knowledge, which is called &amp;lsquo;upāsanā,&amp;rsquo; has the character of devout meditation (bhakti), and consists in direct intuition of Brahman, is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Cḥ. Up. V, 11, 6; 18, 1). The doubt here arises whether that Vaiśvānara Self can be made out to be the highest Self or not. The Pūrvapakshin maintains the latter alternative. For, he says, the word Vaiśvānara is used in the sacred texts in four different senses. It denotes in the first place the intestinal fire, so in Br̥. Up, V, 9, &amp;lsquo;That is the Vaiśvānara fire by which the food that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise is that which one hears when one covers one&amp;rsquo;s ears. When man is on the point of departing this life he does not hear that noise.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;It next denotes the third of the elements, so in R̥. Saṁh.

When, therefore, we recognise that shape as referred to in the text, this supplies an inferential mark of Vaiśvānara being the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The &amp;rsquo;thus&amp;rsquo; (iti) in the Sūtra denotes a certain mode, that is to say, &amp;lsquo;a shape of such a kind being recognised in the text enables us to infer that Vaiśvānara is the highest Self.&amp;rsquo; For in Scripture and Smr̥ti alike the highest Person is declared to have such a shape. Cp. e.g. the text of the Átharvaṇas. &amp;lsquo;Agni is his head, the sun and moon his eyes, the regions his cars, his speech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the Universe; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self of all things&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, I, 4). &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo; in this passage denotes the heavenly world, in agreement with the text &amp;rsquo;that world indeed is Agni.&amp;rsquo; And the following Smrr̥ti texts: &amp;lsquo;He of whom the wise declare the heavenly world to be the head, the ether the navel, sun and moon the eyes, the regions the ears, the earth the feet; he whose Self is unfathomable is the leader of all beings&amp;rsquo;; and &amp;lsquo;of whom Agni is the mouth, heaven the head, the ether the navel, the earth the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Vaiśvānara cannot be ascertained to be the highest Self, because, on the account of the text and of the abiding within, we can understand by the Vaiśvānara in our text the intestinal fire also.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jaimini thinks that there is no objection to (the word &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo;) directly (denoting the highest Self).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far it has been maintained that the word &amp;lsquo;Agni,&amp;rsquo; which stands in co-ordination with the term &amp;lsquo;Vaiśvānara,&amp;rsquo; denotes the highest Self in so far as qualified by the intestinal fire constituting its body; and that hence the text under discussion enjoins meditation on the highest Self. Jaimini, on the other hand, is of opinion that there is no reasonable objection to the term &amp;lsquo;Agni,&amp;rsquo; no less than the term: &amp;lsquo;Vaiśvānara,&amp;rsquo; being taken &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; to denote the highest Self. That is to say&amp;ndash;in the same way as the term &amp;lsquo;Vaiśvānara,&amp;rsquo; although a common term, yet when qualified by attributes especially belonging to the highest Self is known to denote the latter only as possessing the quality of ruling all men; so the word &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo; also when appearing in connexion with special attributes belonging to the highest Self denotes that Self only. For any quality on the ground of which &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo; may be etymologically explained to denote ordinary fire&amp;ndash;as when e.g. we explain &amp;lsquo;agni&amp;rsquo; as he who &amp;lsquo;agre nayati&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;may also, in its highest non-conditioned degree, be ascribed to the supreme Self.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;30&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of definiteness; thus Āśmarathya opines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher Āśmarathya is of opinion that the text represents the highest Self as possessing a definite extent, to the end of rendering the thought of the meditating devotee more definite. That is to say&amp;ndash;the limitation due to the limited extent of heaven, sun, &amp;amp;c. has the purpose of rendering definite to thought him who pervades (abhi) all this Universe and in reality transcends all measure (vimāna).&amp;ndash;A further difficulty remains. For what purpose is the highest Brahman here represented like a man, having a head and limbs?&amp;ndash;This point the next Sūtra elucidates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;31&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of meditation, Bādari thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher Bādari thinks that the representation in the text of the supreme Self in the form of a man is for the purpose of devout meditation. &amp;lsquo;He who in this way meditates on that Vaiśvānara Self as &amp;ldquo;prādeśamātra&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;abhivimāna,&amp;rdquo; he eats food in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.&amp;rsquo; What this text enjoins is devout meditation for the purpose of reaching Brahman. &amp;lsquo;In this way&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;as having a human form.&amp;rsquo; And &amp;rsquo;the eating&amp;rsquo; of food in all worlds, &amp;amp;c. means the gaining of intuitional knowledge of Brahman which abides everywhere and is in itself of the nature of supreme bliss. The special kind of food, i.e. the special objects of enjoyment which belong to the different Selfs standing under the influence of karman cannot be meant here; for those limited objects have to be shunned by those who desire final release. A further question arises. If Vaiśvānara is the highest Self, how can the text say that the altar is its chest, the grass on the altar its hairs, and so&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;32&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of imaginative identification, thus Jaimini thinks; for thus the text declares.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the altar is stated to be the chest of Vaiśvānara, and so on, in order to effect an imaginative identification of the offering to Prāṇa which is daily performed by the meditating devotees and is the means of pleasing Vaiśvānara, having the heaven and so on for his body, i.e. the highest Self, with the Agnihotra-offering. For the fruit due to meditation on the highest Self, as well as the identity of the offering to breath with the Agnihotra, is declared in the following text, &amp;lsquo;He who without knowing this offers the Agnihotra&amp;ndash;that would be as if removing the live coals he were to pour his libation on dead ashes. But he who offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its purport, he offers it in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs. As the fibres of the Ishīkā reed when thrown into the fire are burnt, thus all his sins are burnt.&amp;rsquo; (V, 24, 1-3.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;33&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moreover, they record him in that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They (i.e. the Vājasaneyins) speak of him, viz. Vaiśvānara who has heaven for his head, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;i.e. the highest Self&amp;ndash;as within that, i.e. the body of the devotee, so as to form the abode of the oblation to Prāṇa; viz. in the text,&amp;lsquo;Of that Vaiśvānara Self the head is Sutejas,&amp;rsquo; and so on. The context is as follows. The clause &amp;lsquo;He who meditates on the Vaiśvānara Self as prādeśamātra,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. enjoins meditation on the highest Self having the three worlds for its body, i.e. on Vaiśvānara. The following clause &amp;lsquo;he eats food in all worlds&amp;rsquo; teaches that the attaining of Brahman is the reward of such meditation. And then the text proceeds to teach the Agnihotra offered to Prāṇa, which is something subsidiary to the meditation taught. The text here establishes an identity between the members&amp;ndash;fire, sun, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;of the Vaiśvānara enjoined as object of meditation (which members&lt;/p&gt;</description>
