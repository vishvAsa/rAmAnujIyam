21. For both also speak of it as something different.

Both, i.e. the Mādhyandinas as well as the Kāṇvas, distinguish in their texts the embodied soul, together with speech and other non-intelligent things, from the Ruler within, representing it as an object of his rule. The Mādhyandinas read, 'He who dwells in the Self, whom the Self does not know,' &c.; the Kāṇvas, 'He who dwells

within understanding', &c. The declaration of the individual Self being ruled by the Ruler within implies of course the declaration of the former being different from the latter.

The conclusion from all this is that the Ruler within is a being different from the individual soul, viz. the highest Self free from all evil, Nārāyaṇa.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the internal Ruler'.
