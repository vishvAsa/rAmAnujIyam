The enquiry into the nature of duty, however, does not form such a prerequisite, since a consideration of the Vedanta-texts may be undertaken by any one who has read those texts, even if he is not acquainted with works.&amp;ndash;But in the Vedanta-texts there are enjoined meditations on the Udgītha and the like which;uc matters auxiliary to works; and such meditations are not possible for him who is not acquainted with those works!&amp;ndash;You who raise this objection clearly are ignorant of what kind of knowledge the Śārīraka Mīmāṁsā is concerned with! What that śāstra aims at is to destroy completely that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE SMALL SIDDHĀNTA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-small-siddhānta&#34;&gt;THE SMALL SIDDHĀNTA.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To this argumentation we make the following reply. We admit that release consists only in the cessation of Nescience, and that this cessation results entirely from the knowledge of Brahman. But a distinction has here to be made regarding the nature of this knowledge which&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the Vedānta-texts aim at enjoining for the purpose of putting an end to Nescience. Is it merely the knowledge of the sense of sentences which originates from the sentences? or is it knowledge in the form of meditation (upāsana) which has the knowledge just referred to as its antecedent? It cannot be knowledge of the former kind: for such knowledge springs from the mere apprehension of the sentence, apart from any special injunction, and moreover we do not observe that the cessation of Nescience is effected by such knowledge merely. Our adversary will perhaps attempt to explain things in the following way. The Vedānta-texts do not, he will say, produce that knowledge which makes an end of Nescience, so long as the imagination of plurality is not dispelled. And the fact that such knowledge, even when produced, does not at once and for every one put a stop to the view of plurality by no means subverts my opinion; for, to mention an analogous instance, the double appearance of the moon&amp;ndash;presenting itself to a person affected with a certain weakness of vision&amp;ndash;does not come to an end as soon as the oneness of the moon has been apprehended by reason. Moreover, even without having come to an end, the view of plurality is powerless to effect further bondage, as soon as the root, i.e. Nescience, has once been cut But this defence we are unable to admit. It is impossible that knowledge should not arise when its means, i.e. the texts conveying knowledge, are once present. And we observe that even when there exists an antagonistic imagination (interfering with the rise of knowledge), information given by competent persons, the presence of characteristic marks (on which a correct inference may be based), and the like give rise to knowledge which sublates the erroneous imagination. Nor can we admit that even after the sense of texts has been apprehended, the view of plurality may continue owing to some small remainder of beginningless imagination. For as this imagination which constitutes the means for the view of plurality is itself false, it is necessarily put an end to by the rise of true knowledge. If this did not take place, that imagination would never come to an end, since there is no&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The theory therefore must needs be rejected by all those who, through texts, perception and the other means of knowledge&amp;ndash;assisted by sound reasoning&amp;ndash;have an insight into the true nature of things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Speech operates with words and sentences. Now a word (pada) originates from the combination of a radical element and a suffix, and as these two elements have different meanings it necessarily follows that the word itself can convey only a sense affected with difference. And further, the plurality of words is based on plurality of meanings; the sentence therefore which is an aggregate of words expresses some special combination of things (meanings of words), and hence has no power to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pratyaksha&amp;ndash;even of the nirvikalpaka kind&amp;ndash;proves difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;pratyaksha--even-of-the-nirvikalpaka-kind--proves-difference&#34;&gt;Pratyaksha&amp;ndash;even of the nirvikalpaka kind&amp;ndash;proves difference.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perception in the next place&amp;ndash;with its two subdivisions of non-determinate (nirvikalpaka) and determinate (savikalpaka) perception&amp;ndash;also cannot be a means of knowledge for things devoid of difference. Determinate perception clearly has for its object things affected with difference; for it relates to that which is distinguished by generic difference and so on. But also non-determinate perception has for its object only what is marked with difference; for it is on the basis of non-determinate perception that the object distinguished by generic character and so on is recognised in the act of determinate perception. Non-determinate perception is the apprehension of the object in so far as destitute of some differences but not of all difference. Apprehension of the latter kind is in the first place not observed ever to take place, and is in the second place impossible: for all apprehension by consciousness takes place by means of some distinction &amp;lsquo;This is such and such.&amp;rsquo; Nothing can be apprehended apart from some special feature of make or structure, as e.g. the triangularly shaped dewlap in the case of cows. The true distinction between non-determinate and determinate perception is that the former is the apprehension of the first individual among a number of things belonging to the same class, while the latter is the apprehension of the second, third, and so on, individuals. On the apprehension of the first individual cow the perceiving person is not conscious of the fact that the special shape which constitutes the generic character of the class &amp;lsquo;cows&amp;rsquo; extends to the present individual also; while this special consciousness arises in the case of the perception of the second and third cow. The perception of the second individual thus is &amp;lsquo;determinate&amp;rsquo; in so far as it is determined by a special attribute, viz. the extension, to the perception, of the generic character of a class&amp;ndash;manifested in a certain&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Take the judgment &amp;lsquo;This is such and such&amp;rsquo;; how can we realise here the non-difference of &amp;lsquo;being this&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being such and such&amp;rsquo;? The &amp;lsquo;such and such&amp;rsquo; denotes a peculiar make characterised, e.g. by a dewlap, the &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo; denotes the thing distinguished by that peculiar make; the non-difference of these two is thus contradicted by immediate consciousness. At the outset the thing perceived is perceived as separate from all other things, and this separation is founded on the fact that the thing is distinguished by a special constitution, let us say the generic characteristics of a cow, expressed by the term &amp;lsquo;such and such.&amp;rsquo; In general, wherever we cognise the relation of distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And thus, even in the case of disagreement as to the number of the different instruments of knowledge, a thing devoid of difference could not be established by any of them since the instruments of knowledge acknowledged by all have only one and the same object, viz. what is marked by difference. And a person who maintains the existence of a thing devoid of difference on the ground of differences affecting that very thing simply contradicts himself without knowing what he does; he is in fact no better than a man who asserts that his own mother never had any children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You yourself admit that in the case of knowledge and in that of colour and other qualities this relation holds good, viz. that something which gives rise to a judgment about another thing at the same time gives rise to a judgment about itself; the same may therefore be admitted with regard to difference &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The true meaning of Svayaṁprakāsatva.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-true-meaning-of-svayaṁprakāsatva&#34;&gt;The true meaning of Svayaṁprakāsatva.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We next take up the point as to the self-luminousness of consciousness (above, p. 33). The contention that consciousness is not an object holds good for the knowing Self at the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;time when it illumines (i.e. constitutes as its objects) other things; but there is no absolute rule as to all consciousness never being anything but self-luminous. For common observation shows that the consciousness of one person may become the object of the cognition of another, viz. of an inference founded on the person&amp;rsquo;s friendly or unfriendly appearance and the like, and again that a person&amp;rsquo;s own past states of consciousness become the object of his own cognition&amp;ndash;as appears from judgments such as &amp;lsquo;At one time I knew.&amp;rsquo; It cannot therefore be said &amp;lsquo;If it is consciousness it is self-proved&amp;rsquo; (above p. 33), nor that consciousness if becoming an object of consciousness would no longer be consciousness; for from this it would follow that one&amp;rsquo;s own past states, and the conscious states of others&amp;ndash;because being objects of consciousness&amp;ndash;are not themselves consciousness. Moreover, unless it were admitted that there is inferential knowledge of the thoughts of others, there would be no apprehension of the connexion of words and meaning, and this would imply the absolute termination of all human intercourse depending on speech. Nor also would it be possible for pupils to attach themselves to a teacher of sacred lore, for the reason that they had become aware of his wisdom and learning. The general proposition that consciousness does not admit of being an object is in fact quite untenable. The essential &amp;rsquo;nature of consciousness or knowledge&amp;ndash;consists therein that it shines forth, or manifests itself, through its own being to its own substrate at the present moment; or (to give another definition) that it is instrumental in proving its own object by its own being &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But this is an attempt to prove something not proved by something else that is equally unproved; comparable to a man blind from birth undertaking to guide another blind man! You have no right to maintain the non-existence of the antecedent non-existence of consciousness on the ground that there is nothing to make us apprehend that non-existence; for there is something to make us apprehend it, viz. consciousness itself!&amp;ndash;But how can consciousness at the time when it is, make us apprehend its own previous non-existence which is contradictorily opposed to it?&amp;ndash;Consciousness, we rejoin, does not necessarily constitute as its objects only what occupies the same time with itself; were it so it would follow that neither the past nor the future can be the object of consciousness. Or do you mean that there is an absolute rule that the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no consciousness without object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;there-is-no-consciousness-without-object&#34;&gt;There is no consciousness without object.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nor is there any consciousness devoid of objects; for nothing of this kind is ever known. Moreover, the self-luminousness of consciousness has, by our opponent himself, been proved on the ground that its essential nature consists in illumining (revealing) objects; the self-luminousness of consciousness not admitting of proof apart from its essential nature which consists in the lighting up of objects. And as moreover, according to our opponent, consciousness cannot be the object of another consciousness, it would follow that (having neither an object nor itself being an object) it is something altogether unreal, imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is capable of change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;consciousness-is-capable-of-change&#34;&gt;Consciousness is capable of change.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against the assertion that the alleged non-origination of consciousness at the same time proves that consciousness is not capable of any other changes (p. 36), we remark that the general proposition on which this conclusion rests is too wide: it would extend to antecedent non-existence itself, of which it is evident that it comes to an end, although it does not originate. In qualifying the changes as changes of &amp;lsquo;Being,&amp;rsquo; you manifest great logical acumen indeed! For according to your own view Nescience also (which is not &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo;) does not originate, is the substrate of manifold changes, and comes to an end through the rise of knowledge! Perhaps you will say that the changes of Nescience are all unreal. But, do you then, we ask in reply, admit that any change is real? You do not; and yet it is only this admission which would give a sense to the distinction expressed by the word &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;consciousness-is-the-attribute-of-a-permanent-conscious-self&#34;&gt;Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let it then be said that consciousness is proof (siddhiḥ) itself. Proof of what, we ask in reply, and to whom? If no definite answer can be given to these two questions, consciousness cannot be defined as &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo;; for &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo; is a relative notion, like &amp;lsquo;son.&amp;rsquo; You will perhaps reply &amp;lsquo;Proof to the Self&amp;rsquo;; and if we go on asking &amp;lsquo;But what is that Self&amp;rsquo;? you will say, &amp;lsquo;Just consciousness as already said by us before.&amp;rsquo; True, we reply, you said so; but it certainly was not well said. For if it is the nature of consciousness to be &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo; (&amp;rsquo;light,&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo;) on the part of a person with regard to something, how can this consciousness which is thus connected with the person and the thing be itself conscious of itself? To explain: the essential character of consciousness or knowledge is that by its very existence it renders things capable of becoming objects, to its own substrate, of thought and speech. This consciousness (anubhūti), which is also termed jñāna, avagati, saṁvid, is a particular attribute belonging to a conscious Self and related to an object: as such it is known to every one on the testimony of his own Self&amp;ndash;as appears from ordinary judgments such as &amp;lsquo;I know the jar,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;I understand this matter,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;I am conscious of (the presence of) this piece of cloth.&amp;rsquo; That such is the essential nature of consciousness you yourself admit; for you have proved thereby its self-luminousness. Of this consciousness which thus clearly presents itself as the attribute of an agent and as related to an object, it would be difficult indeed to prove that at the same time it is itself the agent; as difficult as it would be to prove that the object of action is the agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You maintain that consciousness which is in reality devoid alike of objects and substrate presents itself, owing to error, in the form of a knowing subject, just as mother o&amp;rsquo; pearl appears as silver; (consciousness itself being viewed as a real substrate of an erroneous imputation), because an erroneous imputation cannot take place apart from a substrate. But this theory is indefensible. If things were as you desciibe them, the conscious &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; would be cognised as co-ordinate with the state of consciousness &amp;lsquo;I am consciousness,&amp;rsquo; just as the shining thing presenting itself to our eyes is judged to be silver. But the fact is that the state of consciousness presents itself as something apart, constituting a distinguishing&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In deep sleep the quality of darkness prevails in the mind and there is no consciousness of outward things, and thus there is no distinct and clear presentation of the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;; but all the same the Self somehow presents itself up to the time of waking in the one form of the &amp;lsquo;I,&amp;rsquo; and the latter cannot therefore be said to be absent.

The &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; is not a mere attribute of the Self so that even after its destruction the essential nature of the Self might persist&amp;ndash;as it persists on the cessation of ignorance; but it constitutes the very nature of the Self. Such judgments as &amp;lsquo;I know&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Knowledge has arisen in me&amp;rsquo;, show, on the other hand, that we are conscious of knowledge as a mere attribute of the Self.&amp;ndash;Moreover, a man who suffering pain, mental or of other kind&amp;ndash;whether such pain be real or due to error only&amp;ndash;puts himself in relation to pain&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;I am suffering pain&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;naturally begins to reflect how he may once for all free himself from all these manifold afflictions and enjoy a state of untroubled ease; the desire of final release thus having arisen in him he at once sets to work to accomplish it. If, on the other hand, he were to realise that the effect of such activity would be the loss of personal existence, he surely would turn away as soon as somebody began to tell him about &amp;lsquo;release&amp;rsquo;. And the result of this would be that, in the absence of willing and qualified pupils, the whole scriptural teaching as to final release would lose its authoritative character.&amp;ndash;Nor must you maintain against this that even in the state of release there persists pure consciousness; for this by no means improves your case. No sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity termed &amp;lsquo;pure light!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;What constitutes the &amp;lsquo;inward&amp;rsquo; Self thus is the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;, the knowing subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The True cannot be known through the Untrue.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With reference to the assertion (p. 24 ff.) that Perception, which depends on the view of plurality, is based on some defect and hence admits of being otherwise accounted for&amp;ndash;whence it follows that it is sublated by Scripture; we ask you to point out what defect it is on which Perception is based and may hence be accounted for otherwise.&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo; The beginningless imagination of difference&amp;rsquo; we expect you to reply.&amp;ndash;But, we ask in return, have you then come to know by some other means that this beginningless imagination of difference, acting in a manner analogous to that of certain defects of vision, is really the cause of an altogether perverse view of things?&amp;ndash;If you reply that this is known just from the fact that Perception is in conflict with Scripture, we point out that you are reasoning in a circle: you prove the defectiveness of the imagination of plurality through the fact that Scripture tells us about a substance devoid of all difference; and at the same time you prove the latter point through the former. Moreover, if Perception gives rise to perverse cognition because it is based on the imagination of plurality, Scripture also is in no better case&amp;ndash;for it is based on the very same view.&amp;ndash;If against this you urge that Scripture, although based on a defect, yet sublates Perception in so far as it is the cause of a cognition which dispels all plurality apprehended through Perception, and thus is later in order than Perception; we rejoin that the defectiveness of the foundation of Scripture having once been recognised, the circumstance of its being later is of no avail. For if a man is afraid of a rope which he mistakes for a snake his fear does not come to an end because another man, whom he considers to be in error himself, tells him &amp;lsquo;This is no snake, do not be afraid.&amp;rsquo; And that Scripture is founded on something defective is known at the very time of hearing Scripture, for the reflection (which follows on hearing) consists in repeated attempts to cognise the oneness of Brahman&amp;ndash;a cognition which is destructive of all the plurality apprehended&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Intelligence free from all difference.&amp;ndash;This we cannot allow. For the section in which the quoted text occurs, in order to make good the initial declaration that by the knowledge of one thing all things are known, shows that the highest Brahman which is denoted by the term &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; is the substantial and also the operative cause of the world; that it is all-knowing, endowed with all powers; that its purposes come true; that it is the inward principle, the support and the ruler of everything; and that distinguished by these and other good qualities it constitutes the Self of the entire world; and then finally proceeds to instruct Śvetaketu that this Brahman constitutes his Self also (&amp;lsquo;Thou art that&amp;rsquo;). We have fully set forth this point in the Vedārtha-saṁgraha and shall establish it in greater detail in the present work also, in the so-called ārambhaṇa-adhikaraṇa.&amp;ndash;In the same way the passage &amp;rsquo;the higher knowledge is that by which the Indestructible is apprehended, &amp;amp;c.&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5) first denies of Brahman all the evil qualities connected with Prakr̥ti, and then teaches that to it there belong eternity, all-pervadingness. subtilty, omnipresence, omniscience, imperishableness,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of Nescience cannot be proved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-theory-of-nescience-cannot-be-proved&#34;&gt;The theory of Nescience cannot be proved.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To explain. When I am conscious that I am non-knowing, is there or is there not apprehension of the Self as having non-existence of knowledge for its attribute, and of knowledge as the counterentity of non-knowledge? In the former case there can be no consciousness of the absence of knowledge, for that would imply a contradiction. In the latter case, such consciousness can all the less exist, for it presupposes knowledge of that to which absence of knowledge belongs as an attribute (viz. the Self) and of its own counterentity, viz. knowledge. The same difficulty arises if we view the absence of knowledge as either the object of Inference, or as the object of the special means of proof called &amp;lsquo;abhāva&amp;rsquo; (i.e. anupalabdhi). If, on the other hand, non-knowledge is viewed (not as a merely negative, but) as a positive entity, there arises no contradiction even if there is (as there is in fact) at the same time knowledge of the Self as qualified by non-knowledge, and of knowledge as the counterentity of non-knowledge; and we therefore must accept the conclusion that the state of consciousness expressed by &amp;lsquo;I am non-knowing,&amp;rsquo; has for its object a non-knowledge which is a positive entity.&amp;ndash;But, a Nescience which is a positive entity, contradicts the witnessing consciousness, whose nature consists in the lighting up of the truth of things! Not so, we reply. Witnessing consciousness has for its object not the true nature of things, but Nescience; for otherwise the lighting up (i.e. the consciousness) of false things could not take place. Knowledge which has for its object non-knowledge (Nescience), does not put an end to that non-knowledge. Hence there is no contradiction (between caitanya and ajñana).&amp;ndash;But, a new objection is raised, this positive entity, Nescience, becomes an object of witnessing Consciousness, only in so far as it (Nescience) is defined by some particular object (viz. the particular thing which is not known), and such objects depend for their proof on the different means of knowledge. How then can that Nescience, which is defined by the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; (as expressed e. g. in the judgment, &amp;lsquo;I do not&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the scriptural account of creation preceded by intention on the part of the Creator it is said that each of these elements was made tripartite; and this tripartite constitution of all things is apprehended by Perception as well. The red colour in burning fire comes from (primal elementary) fire, the white colour from water, the black colour from earth&amp;ndash;in this way Scripture explains the threefold nature of burning fire. In the same way all things are composed of elements of all things. The Vishṇu Purāṇa, in its account of creation, makes a similar statement: &amp;ldquo;The elements possessing various powers and being unconnected could not, without combination, produce living beings, not having mingled in any way. Having combined, therefore, with one another, and entering into mutual associations&amp;ndash;beginning with the principle called Mahat, and extending down to the gross elements&amp;ndash;they formed an egg,&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;c. (Vi. Pu. I, 2, 50; 52). This tripartiteness of the elements the Sūtrakāra also declares&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a non-qualified Brahman.&amp;ndash;the meaning of &amp;rsquo;tat tvam asi.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;scripture-does-not-teach-that-release-is-due-to-the-knowledge-of-a-non-qualified-brahman--the-meaning-of-tat-tvam-asi&#34;&gt;Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a non-qualified Brahman.&amp;ndash;the meaning of &amp;rsquo;tat tvam asi.&#39;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nor can we admit the assertion that Scripture teaches the cessation of avidyā to spring only from the cognition of a Brahman devoid of all difference. Such a view is clearly negatived by passages such as the following: &amp;lsquo;I know that great person of sun-like lustre beyond darkness; knowing him a man becomes immortal, there is no other&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some texts declare a distinction of nature between non-intelligent matter, intelligent beings, and Brahman, in so far as matter is the object of enjoyment, the souls the enjoying subjects, and Brahman the ruling principle. &amp;lsquo;From that the Lord of Māyā creates all this; in that the other&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman as the universal self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;nescience-cannot-be-terminated-by-the-simple-act-of-cognising-brahman-as-the-universal-self&#34;&gt;Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman as the universal self.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The doctrine, again, that Nescience is put an end to by the cognition of Brahman being the Self of all can in no way be upheld; for as bondage is something real it cannot be put an end to by knowledge. How, we ask, can any one assert that bondage&amp;ndash;which consists in the experience of pleasure and pain caused by the connexion of souls with bodies of various kind, a connexion springing from good or evil actions&amp;ndash;is something false, unreal? And that the cessation of such bondage is to be obtained only through the grace of the highest Self pleased by the devout meditation of the worshipper, we have already explained. As the cognition of universal oneness which you assume rests on a view of things directly contrary to reality, and therefore is false, the only effect it can have is to strengthen the ties of bondage. Moreover, texts such as &amp;lsquo;But different is the highest Person&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XV, 17), and &amp;lsquo;Having known the Self and the Mover as separate&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. I, 6), teach that it is the cognition of Brahman as the inward ruler different from the individual soul, that effects the highest aim of man, i.e. final release. And, further, as that &amp;lsquo;bondage-terminating&amp;rsquo; knowledge which you assume is itself unreal, we should have to look out for another act of cognition to put an end to it.&amp;ndash;But may it not be said that this terminating cognition, after having put an end to the whole aggregate of distinctions antagonistic to it, immediately passes away itself, because being of a merely&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>30 the vedāntin aiming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Vedāntin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from Scripture, need not be disconcerted by the Mīmāṁsā-theory of all speech having informing power with regard to actions only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-vedāntin-aiming-to-ascertain-the-nature-of-brahman-from-scripture-need-not-be-disconcerted-by-the-mīmāṁsā-theory-of-all-speech-having-informing-power-with-regard-to-actions-only&#34;&gt;The Vedāntin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from Scripture, need not be disconcerted by the Mīmāṁsā-theory of all speech having informing power with regard to actions only.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here another primā facie view &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; finally presents itself. The power of words to denote things cannot be ascertained in any way but by observing the speech and actions of experienced people. Now as such speech and action always implies the idea of something to be done (kārya), words are means of knowledge only with reference to things to be done; and hence the matter inculcated by the Veda also is only things to be done. From this it follows that the Vedānta-texts cannot claim the position of authoritative means of knowledge with regard to Brahman, which is (not a thing to be done but) an accomplished fact.&amp;ndash;Against this view it must not be urged that in the case of sentences expressive of accomplished facts&amp;ndash;as e.g. that a son is born to somebody&amp;ndash;the idea of a particular thing may with certainty be inferred as the cause of certain outward signs&amp;ndash;such as e.g. a pleased expression of countenance&amp;ndash;which are generally due to the attainment of a desired object; for the possible causes of joy, past, present, and future, are infinite in number, and in the given case other causes of joy, as e.g. the birth having taken place in an auspicious moment, or having been an easy one, &amp;amp;c., may easily be imagined. Nor, again, can it be maintained that the denotative power of words with regard to accomplished things may be ascertained in the way of our inferring either the meaning of one word from the known meaning of other words, or the meaning of the radical part of a word from the known meaning of a formative element; for the fact is that we are only able to infer on the basis of a group of words known to denote a certain thing to be done, what the meaning of some particular constituent of that group may be.&amp;ndash;Nor, again, when a person, afraid of what he thinks to be a snake, is observed&lt;/p&gt;</description>
