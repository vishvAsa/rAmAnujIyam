19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred (i.e. matter).

In order that the individual soul which is enthralled by Nescience may operate as the cause of the world, it must needs be connected with non-sentient matter, called by such names as pradhāna, or ānumānika (that which is inferred). For such is the condition for the creative energy of Brahmā and similar beings. Our text, on the other hand, teaches that the creation of the aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things results from the mere wish of a being free from all connexion with non-sentient matter, 'He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth;' 'He sent forth all, whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). We thus understand that that Self of bliss which sends forth the world does not require connexion with non-sentient matter called ānumānika, and hence conclude that it is other than the individual soul.--A further reason is stated in the next Sūtra.
