RĀMĀNUJA'S SRĪBHĀSHYA



VEDĀNTA-SŪTRAS WITH  RĀMĀNUJA'S SRĪBHĀSHYA

FIRST ADHYĀYA.

FIRST PĀDA.

MAY my mind be filled with devotion towards the highest Brahman, the abode of Lakshmi who is luminously revealed in the Upanishads; who in sport produces, sustains, and reabsorbs the entire Universe; whose only aim is to foster the manifold classes of beings that humbly worship him.

The nectar of the teaching of Parāsara's son (Vyāsa),--which was brought up from the middle of the milk-ocean of the Upanishads--which restores to life the souls whose vital strength had departed owing to the heat of the fire of transmigratory existence--which was well guarded by the teachers of old--which was obscured by the mutual conflict of manifold opinions,--may intelligent men daily enjoy that as it is now presented to them in my words.

The lengthy explanation (vr̥tti) of the Brahma-sūtras which was composed by the Reverend Bodhāyana has been abridged by former teachers; according to their views the words of the Sūtras will be explained in this present work.
