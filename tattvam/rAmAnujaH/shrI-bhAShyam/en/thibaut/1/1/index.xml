      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Brahman is that) from which the origin, &amp;amp;c., of this (world proceed).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The expression &amp;rsquo;the origin&amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;c., means &amp;lsquo;creation, subsistence, and reabsorption&amp;rsquo;. The &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo; (in &amp;lsquo;of this&amp;rsquo;) denotes this entire world with its manifold wonderful arrangements, not to be fathomed by thought, and comprising within itself the aggregate of living souls from Brahmā down to blades of grass, all of which experience the fruits (of their former actions) in definite places and at definite times. &amp;lsquo;That from which,&amp;rsquo; i.e. that highest Person who is the ruler of all; whose nature is antagonistic to all evil; whose purposes come true; who possesses infinite auspicious qualities, such as knowledge, blessedness, and so on; who is omniscient, omnipotent, supremely merciful; from whom the creation, subsistence, and reabsorption of this world proceed&amp;ndash;he is Brahman: such is the meaning of the Sūtra.&amp;ndash;The definition here given of Brahman is founded on the text Taitt. Up. III, 1, &amp;lsquo;Bhr̥gu Vāruṇi went to his father Varuṇa, saying, Sir, teach me Brahman&amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;c., up to &amp;lsquo;That from which these beings are born, that by which when born they live, that into which they enter at their death, try to know that: that is Brahman.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For it is an acknowledged principle that Scripture has meaning only with regard to what is not established by other sources of knowledge.&amp;ndash;But what, to raise a primā facie counter objection, are those other sources of knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But that (i.e. the authoritativeness of Scripture with regard to Brahman) exists on account of the connexion (of Scripture with the highest aim of man).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to rebut the objection raised. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the authoritativeness of Scripture with regard to Brahman, is possible, on account of samanvaya, i.e. connexion with the highest aim of man&amp;ndash;that is to say because the scriptural texts are connected with, i.e. have for their subject, Brahman, which constitutes the highest aim of man. For such is the connected meaning of the whole aggregate of words which constitutes the Upanishads&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;That from whence these beings are born&amp;rsquo;(Taitt. Up. III, 1, 1). &amp;lsquo;Being only this was in the beginning, one, without a second&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 2), &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. And of aggregates of words which are capable of giving information about accomplished things known through the ordinary means of ascertaining the meaning of words, and which connectedly refer to a Brahman which is the cause of the origination, subsistence, and destruction of the entire world, is antagonistic to all imperfection and so on, we have no right to say that, owing to the absence of a purport in the form of activity or cessation of activity, they really refer to something other than Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of seeing (i.e. thinking) that which is not founded on Scripture (i.e. the Pradhāna) is not (what is taught by the texts referring to the origination of the world).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have maintained that what is taught by the texts relative to the origination of the world is Brahman, omniscient, and so on. The present Sūtra and the following Sūtras now add that those texts can in no way refer to the Pradhāna and similar entities which rest on Inference only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that (the word &amp;lsquo;seeing&amp;rsquo;) has a secondary (figurative) meaning; we deny this, on account of the word &amp;lsquo;Self&amp;rsquo; (being applied to the cause of the world).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The contention that, because, in passages standing close by, the word &amp;lsquo;seeing&amp;rsquo; is used in a secondary sense, the &amp;lsquo;seeing&amp;rsquo; predicated of the Sat (&amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo;) is also to be taken in a secondary sense, viz. as denoting (not real thought but) a certain condition previous to creation, cannot be upheld; for in other texts met with in the same section (viz. &amp;lsquo;All this has that for its Self; that is the True, that is the Self&amp;rsquo;, Cḥ. Up. VI, 8, 7), that which first had been spoken of as Sat is called the &amp;lsquo;Self&amp;rsquo;. The designation &amp;lsquo;Self&amp;rsquo; which in this passage is applied to the Sat in its relation to the entire world, sentient or non-sentient, is in no way appropriate to the Pradhāna. We therefore conclude that, as the highest Self is the Self of fire, water, and earth also, the words fire, &amp;amp;c. (in the passages stating that fire, &amp;amp;c. thought) denote the highest Self only. This conclusion agrees with the text &amp;lsquo;Let me enter into these three beings with this living Self, and evolve names and forms&amp;rsquo;, for this text implies that fire, water, &amp;amp;c. possess substantial being and definite names only through the highest Self having entered into them. The thought ascribed in the text to fire, water, &amp;amp;c. hence is thought in the proper sense, and the hypothesis that, owing to its connexion with these latter texts, the thought predicated of &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;iṭ thought,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.) should be thought in a figurative sense only thus lapses altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pradhāna is not the cause of the world for the following reason also:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And because there is no statement of its having to be set aside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the word &amp;lsquo;Sat&amp;rsquo; denoted the Pradhāna as the cause of the world, we should expect the text to teach that the idea of having his Self in that &amp;lsquo;Sat&amp;rsquo; should be set aside by Śvetaketu as desirous of Release; for that idea would be contrary to Release. So far from teaching this, the text, however, directly inculcates that notion in the words &amp;lsquo;Thou art that.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;The next Sūtra adds a further reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now, on the principle of the non-difference of cause and effect, this initial statement can only be fulfilled in that way that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;through the knowledge of the &amp;lsquo;Sat&amp;rsquo;, which is the cause, there is known the entire world, whether sentient or non-sentient, which constitutes the effect. But if the Pradhāna were the cause, the aggregate of sentient beings could not be known through it&amp;ndash;for sentient beings are not the effect of a non-sentient principle, and there would thus arise a contradiction.&amp;ndash;The next Sūtra supplies a further reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With reference to the &amp;lsquo;Sat&amp;rsquo; the text says, &amp;lsquo;Learn from me the true nature of sleep. When a man sleeps here, he becomes united with the Sat, he is gone to his own (Self). Therefore they say he sleeps (svapiti), because he is gone to his own (sva-apīta)&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.VI, 8, 1). This text designates the soul in the state of deep sleep as having entered into, or being merged or reabsorbed in, the Self. By reabsorption we understand something being merged in its cause. Now the non-intelligent Pradhāna cannot be the cause of the intelligent soul; hence the soul&amp;rsquo;s going to its Self can only mean its going to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the universal, Self. The term &amp;lsquo;individual soul&amp;rsquo; (jīva) denotes Brahman in so far as having an intelligent substance for its body, Brahman itself constituting the Self; as we learn from the text referring to the distinction of names and forms. This Brahman, thus called jīva., is in the state of deep sleep, no less than in that of a general pralaya, free from the investment of names and forms, and is then designated as mere &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; (sat); as the text says, &amp;lsquo;he is then united with the Sat&amp;rsquo;. As the soul is in the state of deep sleep free from the investment of name and form, and invested by the intelligent Self only, another text says with reference to the same state,&amp;rsquo; Embraced by the intelligent Self he knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 21). Up to the time of final release there arise in the soul invested by name and form the cognitions of objects different from itself. During deep sleep the souls divest themselves of names and forms, and are embraced by the &amp;lsquo;Sat&amp;rsquo; only; but in the waking state they again invest themselves&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the uniformity of view.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In the beginning the Self was all this; there was nothing else whatsoever thinking. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent forth these worlds&amp;rsquo; (Ait. Ār. II, 4, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;From that Self sprang ether, from ether air, from air fire, from fire water, from water earth&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1); &amp;lsquo;From this great Being were breathed forth the R̥g-veda,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;These and similar texts referring to the creation have all the same purport: they all teach us that the Supreme Lord is the cause of the world. We therefore conclude that in the Cḥ. passage also the Sat, which is said to be the cause of the world, is the Supreme Lord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 3, 2); &amp;lsquo;All these creatures have their root in the Sat, they dwell in the Sat, they rest in the Sat&amp;rsquo; (VI, 8, 4); &amp;lsquo;All this has that for its Self; it is the True, it is the Self (VI, 8, 7);&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Self consisting of Bliss (is the highest Self) on account of multiplication.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read in the text of the Taittirīyas, &amp;lsquo;Different from this Self, which consists of Understanding, is the other inner Self which consists of bliss&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 5).&amp;ndash;Here the doubt arises whether the Self consisting of bliss be the highest Self, which is different from the inner Self subject to bondage and release, and termed &amp;lsquo;jīva.&amp;rsquo; (i.e. living self or individual soul), or whether it be that very inner Self, i.e. the jīva.&amp;ndash;It iś that inner Self, the Pūrvapakshin contends. For the text says &amp;lsquo;of that this, i.e. the Self consisting of bliss, is the śārīra Self&amp;rsquo;; and śārīra means that which is joined to a body, in other words, the so-called jīva.&amp;ndash;But, an objection is raised, the text enumerates the different Selfs, beginning with the Self consisting of bliss, to the end that man may obtain the bliss of Brahman, which was, at the outset, stated to be the cause of the world (II, 1), and in the end teaches that the Self consisting of bliss is the cause of the world (II, 6). And that the cause of the world is the all-knowing Lord, since Scripture says of him that &amp;lsquo;he thought,&amp;rsquo; we have already explained.&amp;ndash;That cause of the world, the Pūrvapakshin rejoins, is not different from the jīva; for in the text of the Cḥāndogyas that Being which first is described as the creator of the world is exhibited, in two passages, in co-ordination with the jīva (&amp;lsquo;having entered into them with that living Self&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Thou art that, O Śvetaketu&amp;rsquo;). And the purport of co-ordination is to express oneness of being, as when we say, &amp;lsquo;This person here is that Devadatta we knew before.&amp;rsquo; And creation preceded by thought can very well be ascribed to an intelligent jīva. The connexion of the whole Taittirīya-text then is as follows. In the introductory clause, &amp;lsquo;He who knows Brahman attains the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up.&amp;ndash;bliss which is reached by successively multiplying by hundred all inferior kinds of bliss&amp;ndash;cannot belong to the individual soul, we conclude that it belongs to Brahman; and as Brahman cannot be an effect, and as -maya. may have the sense of &amp;lsquo;abounding in,&amp;rsquo; we conclude that the ānandamaya is Brahman itself; inner contradiction obliging us to set aside that sense of -maya which is recommended by regard to &amp;lsquo;consequence&amp;rsquo; and frequency of usage. The regard for consistency, moreover, already has to be set aside in the case of the &amp;lsquo;prāṇamaya&amp;rsquo;; for in that term -maya&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He alone causes bliss&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Taitt. Up. II, 7). This means&amp;ndash;He alone is the cause of bliss on the part of the individual souls.&amp;ndash;Some one is here designated as the cause of bliss enjoyed by the souls; and we thus conclude that the causer of bliss, who must be other than the souls to which bliss is imparted, is the highest Self abounding in bliss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The mantra thus is meant to render clear the meaning of the Brāhmaṇa passage. Now the Brahman to be reached by the meditating Devotee must be something different from him. The same point is rendered clear by all the following Brāhmaṇa passages and mantras: &amp;lsquo;from that same Self sprang ether,&amp;rsquo; and so on. The Self abounding in bliss therefore is other than the individual soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not the other, on account of impossibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other than the highest Self, i.e. the one called jīva, even in the state of release, is not that Self which the mantra describes; for this is not possible. For to a Self of that kind unconditioned intelligence (such as is, in the mantra, ascribed to Brahman; cp. the term &amp;lsquo;vipaścitā&amp;rsquo;) cannot belong. Unconditioned intelligence is illustrated by the power of all one&amp;rsquo;s purposes realising themselves; as expressed in the text &amp;lsquo;He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth.&amp;rsquo; Intelligence (vipaścittvam, i.e. power of insight into various things) does indeed belong to the soul in the state of release; but as in the Saṁsāra state the same soul is devoid of such insight, we cannot ascribe to it non-conditioned intelligence. And if the released soul is viewed as being mere non-differenced intelligence, it does not possess the capacity of seeing different things, and hence cannot of course possess vipaścittva in the sense stated above. That, however, the existence of a substance devoid of all difference cannot be proved by any means of knowledge, we have already shown before. Again, if the clause &amp;lsquo;from whence speech returns,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., were meant to express that speech and mind return from Brahman, this could not mean that the Real is devoid of all difference, but only that mind and speech are not means for the knowledge of Brahman. And from this it would follow that Brahman is something altogether empty, futile. Let us examine the context. The whole section, beginning with &amp;lsquo;He who knows Brahman reaches Brahman,&amp;rsquo; declares that Brahman is all-knowing, the cause of the world, consisting of pure bliss, the cause of bliss in others; that through its mere wish it creates the whole universe comprising matter and souls; that entering into the universe of created things it constitutes their Self; that it is the cause of fear and fearlessness; that it rules Vāyu&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For such is the condition for the creative energy of Brahmā and similar beings. Our text, on the other hand, teaches that the creation of the aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things results from the mere wish of a being free from all connexion with non-sentient matter, &amp;lsquo;He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth;&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;He sent forth all, whatever there is&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 6). We thus understand that that Self of bliss which sends forth the world does not require connexion with non-sentient matter called ānumānika, and hence conclude that it is other than the individual soul.&amp;ndash;A further reason is stated in the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. II, 7). This text declares that this one, i.e. the so-called individual soul, enjoys bliss through obtaining the ānandamaya, here called &amp;lsquo;flavour.&amp;rsquo; Now to say that any one is identical with that by obtaining which he enjoys bliss, would be madness indeed.&amp;ndash;It being thus ascertained that the Self of bliss is the highest Brahman, we conclude that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;if that bliss were not in the ether&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7). and &amp;lsquo;knowledge, bliss is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. III, 9, 28), the word &amp;lsquo;ānanda&amp;rsquo; denotes the &amp;lsquo;ānandamaya&amp;rsquo;; just as vijñāna means the vijñānamaya. It is for the same reason (viz. of ānanda meaning the same as ānandamaya) that the clause &amp;lsquo;he who knows the bliss of Brahman&amp;rsquo; exhibits Brahman as being connected&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up.VII). These texts declare all individual souls to be the body of the sinless highest Self which is said to be the inward principle of all of them.&amp;ndash;It is thereby completely proved that the highest Self is something different from all individual souls such as Āditya, and so on.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of the &amp;lsquo;one within.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He said&amp;ndash;Breath. For all these beings merge into breath alone, and from breath they arise. This is the deity belonging to the Prastāva. If without knowing that deity you had sung forth, your head would have fallen off.&amp;rsquo; Here the word &amp;lsquo;breath,&amp;rsquo; analogously to the word &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; denotes the highest Brahman, which is different from what is commonly called breath; we infer this from the fact that special characteristics of Brahman, viz. the whole world&amp;rsquo;s entering into and rising from it, are in that text referred to as well-known things. There indeed here arises a further doubt; for as it is a matter of observation that the existence, activity, &amp;amp;c., of the whole aggregate of creatures depend on breath, breath&amp;ndash;in its ordinary acceptation&amp;ndash;may be called the cause of the world. This doubt is, however, disposed of by the consideration that breath is not present in things such as stones and wood, nor in intelligence itself, and that hence of breath in the ordinary sense it cannot be said that &amp;lsquo;all beings enter into it,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. We therefore conclude that Brahman is here called &amp;lsquo;breath&amp;rsquo; in so far as he bestows the breath of life on all beings. And the general result of the discussion carried on in connexion with the last two Sūtras thus is that the words &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;breath&amp;rsquo; denote something other than what is ordinarily denoted by those terms, viz. the highest Brahman, the sole cause of this entire world, free from all evil, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;breath.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(III, 13, 7), &amp;lsquo;Now that light which shines above this heaven, higher than everything, in the highest worlds beyond which there are no other worlds, that is the same light which is within man.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Here a doubt arises, viz. whether the brightly shining thing here called &amp;rsquo;light&amp;rsquo; is the well-known light of the sun and so on, viewed as a causal universal principle (Brahman); or the all-knowing, &amp;amp;c., highest Person of infinite splendour, who is different in nature from all sentient and non-sentient beings, and is the highest cause.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains that the reference is to ordinary light. For, he says, the passage does not mention a particular characteristic attribute which can belong to the highest Self only&amp;ndash;while such attributes &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; met with in the texts referring to Ether and Breath&amp;ndash;, and as thus there is no opening for a recognition of the highest Self, and as at the same time the text identifies &amp;rsquo;light&amp;rsquo; with the intestinal heat of living beings, we conclude that the text represents the well-known ordinary light as Brahman, the cause of the world&amp;ndash;which is possible as causal agency is connected with extreme light and heat.&amp;ndash;This primā facie view the Sūtra sets aside. The light which the text states to be connected with heaven and possessing supreme splendour can be the highest Person only, since a preceding passage in the same section&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo; All the beings are one foot of it, three feet are the Immortal in heaven&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;refers to all beings as being a foot of that same being which is connected with heaven.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;26&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be objected that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the metre being denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus the direction of the mind (on Brahman) is declared; for thus it is seen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous section at first refers to the metre called Gāyatrī, &amp;lsquo;The Gāyatrī indeed is everything&amp;rsquo; (III, 12, 1), and then introduces&amp;ndash;with the words &amp;rsquo;this is also declared by a &lt;em&gt;Rik&lt;/em&gt; verse&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the verse, &amp;lsquo;Such is the greatness of it (viz. the Gāyatrī),&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. Now, as this verse also refers to the metre, there is not any reference to the highest Person.&amp;ndash;To this objection the second part of the Sūtra replies. The word &amp;lsquo;Gāyatrī&amp;rsquo; does not here denote the metre only, since this cannot possibly be the Self of all; but the text declares the application of the idea of Gāyatrī to Brahman, i.e. teaches, to the end of a certain result being obtained, meditation on Brahman in so far as similar to Gāyatrī. For Brahman having four feet, in the sense indicated by the &lt;em&gt;rik&lt;/em&gt;, may be compared to the Gāyatrī with its four (metrical) feet. The Gāyatrī (indeed has as a rule three feet, but) occasionally a Gāyatrī with four feet is met with; so, e.g., &amp;lsquo;Indraś śacīpatiḥ | valena pīḍitaḥ | duścyavano vr̥shā | samitsu sāsahiḥ.&amp;rsquo; We see that in other passages also words primarily denoting metres are employed in other senses; thus, e.g., in the saṁvargavidyā (Cḥ. Up. IV, 3, 8), where Virāj (the name of a metre of ten syllables) denotes a group of ten divine beings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Owing to this discrepancy, the Brahman referred to in the former text is not recognised in the latter.&amp;ndash;This objection the Sūtra disposes of by pointing out that owing to the essential agreement of the two statements, nothing stands in the way of the required recognition. When we say, &amp;lsquo;The hawk is on the top of the tree,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the hawk is above the top of the tree,&amp;rsquo; we mean one and the same thing.&amp;ndash;The &amp;rsquo;light,&amp;rsquo; therefore, is nothing else but the most glorious and luminous highest Person. Him who in the former passage is called four-footed, we know to have an extraordinarily beautiful shape and colour-(cp., e.g., &amp;lsquo;I know that great Person of sunlike colour beyond the darkness&amp;rsquo; (Śvet.Up. III, 9)&amp;ndash;, and as hence his brilliancy also must be extraordinary, he is, in the text under discussion, quite appropriately called &amp;rsquo;light.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;light.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For, he says, the word &amp;lsquo;Indra&amp;rsquo; is known to denote an individual God, and the word &amp;lsquo;Prāṇa,&amp;rsquo; which stands in grammatical co-ordination with Indra, also applies to individual souls. This individual being, called Indra, instructs Pratardana that meditation on himself is most beneficial to man. But what is most beneficial to man is only the means to attain immortality, and such a means is found in meditation on the causal principle of the world, as we know from the text, &amp;lsquo;For him there is delay only so long as he is not delivered; then he will be perfect&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 14, 2). We hence conclude that Indra, who is known as an individual soul, is the causal principle, Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As thus the initial part of the section clearly refers to an individual being, the terms occurring in the concluding part (&amp;lsquo;blessed,&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;non-ageing,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;immortal&amp;rsquo;) must be interpreted so as to make them agree with what precedes.&amp;ndash;This objection the Sūtra disposes of. &amp;lsquo;For the multitude of connexions with the Self&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;i.e. the multitude of things connected with the Self as its attributes&amp;ndash;is possible only &amp;lsquo;in that,&amp;rsquo; i.e. in that speaker viewed as the highest Brahman. &amp;lsquo;For, as in a car, the circumference of the wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on the nave, thus are these objects placed on the subjects, and the subjects on the prāna. That prāṇa indeed is the intelligent Self, blessed, non-ageing, immortal.&amp;rsquo; The &amp;lsquo;objects&amp;rsquo; (bhūtamātrāḥ) here are the aggregate of non-sentient things; the &amp;lsquo;subjects&amp;rsquo; (prajñāmātrāḥ) are the sentient beings in which the objects are said to abide; when thereupon the texts says that of these subjects the being called Indra and Prāṇa is the abode, and that he is blessed, non-ageing, immortal; this qualification of being the abode of this Universe, with all its non-sentient and sentient beings, can belong to the highest Self only, which is other than all individual souls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 3, 2); &amp;lsquo;In it all that exists has its Self (Cḥ. Up.VI, 8, 7); Entered within, the ruler of creatures, the Self of all&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Ar. III, 21); &amp;lsquo;He who dwelling in the Self is different from the Self,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;32&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said (that Brahman is not meant) on account of characteristic marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air; we say no, on account of the threefoldness of meditation; on account of (such threefold meditation) being met (in other texts also); and on account of (such threefold meditation) being appropriate here (also).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An objection is raised. &amp;lsquo;Let none try to find out what speech is, let him know the speaker&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;I slew the three-headed son of Tvash_tri_; I delivered the Arunmukhas, the devotees, to the wolves&amp;rsquo;; these passages state characteristic marks of an individual soul (viz. the god Indra).&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;As long as Prāṇa dwells in this body, so long there is life&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;Prāṇa alone is the conscious Self, and having laid hold of this body, it makes it rise up.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;These passages again mention&lt;/p&gt;</description>
