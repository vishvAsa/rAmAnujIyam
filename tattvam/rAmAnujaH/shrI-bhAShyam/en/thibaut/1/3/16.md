16. And on account of the settled meaning.

The word 'ether,' moreover, is known to have, among

other meanings, that of Brahman. Compare 'For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that ether were not bliss?' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); 'All these beings take their rise from the ether' (Cḥ. Up. I, 9, 1). It has to be kept in view that in the text under discussion the meaning 'Brahman' is supported by what is said about the qualities of the small ether--viz. freedom from sin, &c.--and hence is stronger than the other meaning--, according to which ākāśa signifies the elemental ether.

So far the Sūtras have refuted the view of the small ether being the element. They now enter on combating the notion that the small ether may possibly be the individual soul.
