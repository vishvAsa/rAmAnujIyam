34. And on account of (Jānaśruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood.

The first section of the vidyā tells us that Jānaśruti bestowed much wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages--which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances suggest Jānaśruti's being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the lowest caste.--The above Sūtra having declared that the kshattriya-hood of Jānaśruti is indicated in the introductory legend, the next Sūtra shows that the same circumstance is indicated in the concluding legend.
