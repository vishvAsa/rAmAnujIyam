      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-pāda&#34;&gt;THIRD PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c. (is the highest Self), on account of terms which are its own.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The followers of the Atharva-veda have the following text, &amp;lsquo;He in whom the heaven, the earth and the sky are woven, the mind also, with all the vital airs, know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words; he is the bank (setu) of the Immortal&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5). The doubt here arises whether the being spoken of as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is the individual soul or the highest Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 1, 3). &amp;lsquo;As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is higher than the high&amp;rsquo; (III, 2, 8). For it is only those freed from the bondage of Saṁsāra who shake off good and evil, are free from passion, and freed from name and form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not that which is inferred, on account of the absence of terms denoting it, and (so also not) the bearer of the Prāṇas (i. e. the individual soul).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the section under discussion does not treat of the Pradhāna, there being no terms referring to that, so it is with regard to the individual soul also. In the text of the Sūtra we have to read either anumānam, i. e. &amp;lsquo;inference,&amp;rsquo; in the sense of &amp;lsquo;object of inference,&amp;rsquo; or else ānumānam, &amp;lsquo;object of inference&amp;rsquo;; what is meant being in both cases the Pradhana inferred to exist by the Sānkhyas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 1, 2). This, and similar texts, speak of that one, i.e. the one previously described as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c., as different from the individual soul.&amp;ndash;The text means&amp;ndash;the individual soul grieves, being bewildered by her who is not &amp;lsquo;īśa,&amp;rsquo; i.e. Prakr̥ti, the object of fruition. But its grief passes away when it sees him who is other than itself, i.e. the beloved Lord of all, and his greatness which consists in his ruling the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And by the arguments set forth in the previous Sūtras of the present Pāda, we have removed all suspicion as to the topic started being dropped in the body of the Upanishad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of them eats the sweet fruit; without eating, the other looks on&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This text declares that one enjoys the fruit of works while the other, without enjoying, shining abides within the body. Now this shining being which does not enjoy the fruit of works can only be the being previously described as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c., and characterised as all knowing, the bridge of immortality, the Self of all; it can in no way be the individual Self which, lamenting, experiences the results of its works. The settled conclusion, therefore, is that the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is none other than the highest Self.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;heaven, earth, and so on.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The bhūman (is the highest Self), as the instruction about it is additional to that about serenity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cḥandogas read as follows: &amp;lsquo;Where one sees nothing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;else, hears nothing else, knows nothing else, that is fulness (bhūman). Where one sees something else, hears something else, knows something else, that is the Little&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 23, 24).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;lsquo;bhūman&amp;rsquo; is derived from &lt;em&gt;bahu&lt;/em&gt; (much, many), and primarily signifies &amp;lsquo;muchness.&amp;rsquo; By &amp;lsquo;much&amp;rsquo; in this connexion, we have however to understand, not what is numerous, but what is large, for the text uses the term in contrast with the &amp;lsquo;Little&amp;rsquo; (alpa), i.e. the &amp;lsquo;Small.&amp;rsquo; And the being qualified as &amp;rsquo;large,&amp;rsquo; we conclude from the context to be the Self; for this section of the Upanishad at the outset states that he who knows the Self overcomes grief (VII, 1, 3), then teaches the knowledge of the bhūman, and concludes by saying that &amp;rsquo;the Self is all this&amp;rsquo; (VII, 25, 2).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So immortality (&amp;lsquo;The Bhūman is immortal,&amp;rsquo; VII, 24, 1); not being based on something else (&amp;lsquo;it rests in its own greatness&amp;rsquo;); being the Self of all (&amp;rsquo;the bhūman is below,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., &amp;lsquo;it is all this&amp;rsquo;); being that which produces all (&amp;lsquo;from the Self there springs breath,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.). All these attributes can be reconciled with the highest Self only.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin has pointed to the text which declares the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; to be the Self of all (VII, 25, 1); but what that text really teaches is meditation on Brahman under the aspect of the &amp;lsquo;I.&amp;rsquo; This appears from the introductory clause &amp;lsquo;Now follows the instruction with regard to the I.&amp;rsquo; That of the &amp;lsquo;I,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the individual Self, also the highest Self is the true Self, scripture declares in several places, so e.g. in the text about the inward Ruler (Br̥. Up. III, 7). As therefore the individual soul finds its completion in the highest Self only, the word &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; also extends in its connotation up to the highest Self; and the instruction about the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; which is given in the text has thus for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Imperishable (is Brahman), on account of its supporting that which is the end of ether.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Vājasaneyins, in the chapter recording the questions asked by Gārgī, read as follows: &amp;lsquo;He said, O Gārgī, the Brāhmaṇas call that the Imperishable. It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long, it is not red, not fluid, it is without a shadow,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. III, 8, 8). A doubt here arises whether that Imperishable be the Pradhāna, or the individual soul, or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pradhāna, it may be maintained in the first place. For we see that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;higher than that which is higher than the Imperishable&amp;rsquo; the term &amp;lsquo;Imperishable&amp;rsquo; actually denotes the Pradhāna; and moreover the qualities enumerated, viz. not being either coarse or fine, &amp;amp;c., are characteristic of the Pradhāna.&amp;ndash;But, an objection is raised, in texts such as &amp;lsquo;That knowledge by which the Imperishable is apprehended&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5), the word &amp;lsquo;Imperishable&amp;rsquo; is seen to denote the highest Brahman!&amp;ndash;In cases, we reply, where the meaning of a word may be determined on the basis either of some&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now such supreme command, through which all things in the universe are held apart, cannot possibly belong to the individual soul in the state either of bondage or of release. The commanding &amp;lsquo;Imperishable&amp;rsquo; therefore is none other than the supreme Person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A supplementary passage excludes difference on the part of the Imperishable from the supreme Person. &amp;lsquo;That Imperishable, O Gārgī, is unseen but seeing; unheard but hearing; unthought but thinking; unknown but knowing. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that thinks but it, nothing that knows but it. In that Imperishable, O Gārgī, the ether is woven, warp and woof.&amp;rsquo; Here the declaration as to the Imperishable being what sees, hears, &amp;amp;c. excludes the non-intelligent Pradhāna; and the declaration as to its being all-seeing, &amp;amp;c. while not&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a snake frees itself from its skin, so he frees himself from evil. He is led up by the Sāman verses to the Brahma-world; he sees the person dwelling in the castle who is higher than the individual souls concreted&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now what is within that small ether that is to be sought for, that is to be understood&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 1).&amp;ndash;The question here arises whether that small ether (space) within the lotus of the heart be the material clement called ether, or the individual Self, or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The first view presenting itself is that the element is meant, for the reason that the word &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; is generally used in that sense; and because the clause &amp;lsquo;what is within that small ether&amp;rsquo; shows that the ether mentioned constitutes the abode of something else that is to be enquired into.&amp;ndash;This view is set aside by the Sūtra. The small ether within the heart is the highest Brahman, on account of the subsequent reasons, contained in clauses of the same section. The passage &amp;lsquo;That Self which is free from evil, free from old age, free from death, free from grief, free from hunger and thirst, whose wishes and purposes come true&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 7, 1) ascribes to that small ether qualities&amp;ndash;such as unconditioned Selfhood, freedom from evil, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;which clearly show that ether to be the highest Brahman. And this conclusion is confirmed by what other texts say about him who knows the small ether attaining the power of realising his own wishes,&amp;lsquo;Those who&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The circumstance, here stated, of all individual souls going to a place which the qualification &lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; connects with the subject-matter of the whole chapter, i.e. the small ether; and the further circumstance of the goal of their going being called the Brahma-world, also prove that the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Brahman).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In continuation of the passage &amp;lsquo;It is the Self free from Sin,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., which refers to the small ether, the text says: &amp;lsquo;it is a bank, a limitary support, that these worlds may not be confounded.&amp;rsquo; What the text here says about the small ether supporting the world proves it to be the highest Brahman; for to support the world is the glory of Brahman. Compare &amp;lsquo;He is the Lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22); &amp;lsquo;By the command of that Imperishable, O Gārgī, heaven and earth stand, held apart&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. III, 8, 9). Now this specific greatness of the highest Brahman, which consists in its supporting the world, is also observed in the small ether&amp;ndash;which proves the latter to be none other than Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Compare &amp;lsquo;For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that ether were not bliss?&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7); &amp;lsquo;All these beings take their rise from the ether&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. I, 9, 1). It has to be kept in view that in the text under discussion the meaning &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is supported by what is said about the qualities of the small ether&amp;ndash;viz. freedom from sin, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;and hence is stronger than the other meaning&amp;ndash;, according to which ākāśa signifies the elemental ether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is meant; we say no, on account of impossibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An objection is raised to the argumentation that, on account of complementary passages, the small ether must be explained to mean the highest Self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For, the objector says, a clear reference to him who is &amp;lsquo;other&amp;rsquo; than the highest Self, i.e. to the individual soul, is contained in the following passage (VIII, 12, 3): &amp;lsquo;Thus does that serenity (samprasāda), having risen from this body and approached the highest light, appear in its own form.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;That is the Self,&amp;rsquo; he said. &amp;lsquo;That is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 7, 3?). We admit that for the different reasons stated above the ether within the heart cannot be the elemental ether; but owing to the force of the intimations conveyed by the complementary passages just quoted, we must adopt the view that what is meant is the individual soul. And as the word &amp;lsquo;ākāśa&amp;rsquo; may be connected with prakāśa (light), it may be applied to the individual soul also.&amp;ndash;This view is set aside by the Sūtra. The small ether cannot be the individual soul because the qualities attributed in the text to the former, viz. freedom from sin, &amp;amp;c., cannot possibly belong to the individual soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that from a subsequent passage (it appears that the individual Soul is meant); rather (the soul) in so far as its true nature has become manifest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Pūrvapakshin now maintains that we ascertain from a subsequent declaration made by Prajāpati that it is just the individual Soul that possesses freedom from sin and the other qualities enumerated. The whole teaching of Prajāpati, he says, refers to the individual Soul only. Indra having heard that Prajāpati had spoken about a Self free from sin, old age, &amp;amp;c., the enquiry into which enables the soul to obtain all worlds and desires, approaches Prajāpati with the wish to learn the true nature of that Self which should be enquired into. Prajāpati thereupon, wishing to test the capacity of his pupil for receiving true instruction, gives him successive information about the embodied soul in the state of waking, dream and dreamless sleep. When he finds that Indra sees no good in instruction of this kind and thus shows himself fit to receive instruction about the true nature of the disembodied Self, he explains to him that the body is a mere abode for a ruling Self; that that bodiless Self is essentially immortal; and that the soul, as long as it is joined to a body due to karman, is compelled to experience pleasure and pain corresponding to its embodied state, while it rises above all this when it has freed itself from the body (VIII, 12, 1). He then continues: &amp;lsquo;Thus that serenity having risen from this body and approached the highest light, appears in its own form&amp;rsquo;; thus teaching him the true nature, free from a body, of the individual soul. He next informs him that the &amp;lsquo;highest light&amp;rsquo; which the soul reaches is the supreme Person (&amp;lsquo;That is the supreme Person&amp;rsquo;), and that the soul having reached that highest light and freed itself from what obscured its own true nature, obtains in the world of Brahman whatever enjoyments it desires, and is no longer connected with a body springing from karman and inseparable from pain and pleasure, or with anything else that causes distress. (&amp;lsquo;He moves about there laughing,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.). He next illustrates&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And the reference has a different meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text in question declares that the released individual soul when reaching the highest light, i.e. Brahman, which is free from all sin, and so on, attains its true nature, which is characterised by similar freedom from sin, and so on. Now this reference to the individual soul, as described in the teaching of Prajāpati, has the purpose of giving instruction (not about the qualities of the individual soul, but) about the nature of that which is the cause of the qualities of the individual soul, i.e. the qualities specially belonging to the supreme Person. The reason why, in the section containing the teaching of Prajāpati, information is given as to the true nature of the released individual soul is that such knowledge assists the doctrine referring to the small ether. For the individual Self which wishes to reach Brahman must know his own true nature also, so as to realise that he, as being himself endowed with auspicious qualities, will finally arrive at an intuition of the highest Brahman, which is a mass of auspicious qualities raised to the highest degree of excellence. The cognition of the soul&amp;rsquo;s own true nature is itself comprised in the result of the meditation on Brahman, and the results which are&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The text making that statement is Mu. Up.

Gī. XIV, 2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that the last two Sūtras constitute a separate adhikaraṇa (head of discussion), meant to prove that the text Mu. Up. II, 2, 10 (&amp;lsquo;After him the shining one, everything shines; by the light of him all this is lighted&amp;rsquo;), refers to the highest Brahman. This view is, however, inadmissible, for the reason that with regard to the text quoted no pūrvapaksha can arise, it having been proved under I, 2, 21 ff., and 1,3, 1, ff., that the whole section of which that text forms part is concerned with Brahman; and it further having been shown under I, 1, 24 ff., that Brahman is apprehended under the form of light.&amp;ndash;The interpretation moreover does not fit in with the wording of the Sūtras.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of the &amp;lsquo;small one.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Ka. Up. II, 4, 1; 13). And &amp;lsquo;The Person not larger than a thumb, the inner Self, is always settled in the heart of men&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 6, 17). A doubt here arises whether the being measured by the extent of a span be the individual soul or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, another scriptural text also declares the individual soul to have that measure,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The individual soul also can be said to have the measure of a thumb only in so far as dwelling within the heart; for scripture directly states that its real size is that of the point of a goad, i.e. minute. And as men only are capable of devout meditation, and hence alone have a claim on scripture, the fact that the hearts of other living creatures also, such as donkeys, horses, snakes, &amp;amp;c., have the same size, cannot give rise to any objection.&amp;ndash;The discussion of this matter will be completed later on  [^sbe48124.htmfn_30].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This offers an opportunity for the discussion of the question whether also other classes of individual souls, such as devas, are qualified for knowledge of Brahman. The Pūrvapakshin denies this qualification in the case of gods and other beings, on the ground of absence of capability. For, he says, bodiless beings, such as gods, are incapable of the accomplishment of meditation on Brahman, which requires as its auxiliaries the seven means enumerated above (p. 17)&amp;ndash;This must not be objected to on the ground of the devas, and so on, having bodies; for there is no means of proof establishing such embodiedness. We have indeed proved above that the Vedānta-texts may intimate accomplished things, and hence are an authoritative means for the cognition of Brahman; but we do not meet with any Vedānta-text, the purport of which is to teach that the devas, and so on, possess bodies. Nor can this point be established through mantras and arthavāda texts; for these are merely supplementary to the injunctions of actions (sacrificial, and so on), and therefore have a different aim. And the injunctions themselves prove nothing with regard to the devas, except that the latter are that with a view to which those actions are performed. In the same way it also cannot be shown that the gods have any desires or wants (to fulfil or supply which they might enter on meditation of Brahman). For the two reasons above we therefore conclude that the devas, and so on, are not qualified for meditation on Brahman.&amp;ndash;This view is contradicted by the Sūtra. Such meditation is possible in the case of higher beings also Bādarāyaṇa thinks; on account of the possibility of want and capacity on their part also. Want and wish exist in their case since they also are liable to suffering, springing from the assaults, hard to be endured, of the different kinds of pain, and since they also know that supreme enjoyment is to be found in the highest Brahman, which is untouched by the shadow even of imperfection, and is a mass of auspicious qualities in their highest perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;26&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny this, on account of the observation of the assumption of several (bodies).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An objection here presents itself. If we admit the gods to have bodies, a difficulty arises at the sacrifices, as it is impossible that one and the same corporeal Indra&amp;ndash;who is at the same time invited by many sacrificers &amp;lsquo;come,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;O Indra&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;come, O Lord of the red horses,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;should be present at all those places. And that the gods, Agni and so on, really do come to the sacrifices is proved by the following scriptural text: &amp;lsquo;To whose sacrifice do the gods go, and to whose not? He who first receives the gods, sacrifices to them on the following day&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Saṁh. I, 6, 7, 1). In refutation of this objection the Suūtra points out that there is seen, i.e. recorded, the assumption of several bodies at the same time, on the part of beings endowed with special powers, such as Saubhari.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But another difficulty presents itself with regard to the words of which the Veda consists. For if Indra and the other gods are corporeal beings, it follows that they are made up of parts and hence non-permanent. This implies either that the Vedic words denoting them&amp;ndash;not differing therein from common worldly words such as Devadatta&amp;ndash;are totally devoid of meaning during all those periods which precede the origination of the beings called Indra and so on, or follow on their destruction; or else that the Veda itself is non-permanent, non-eternal.&amp;ndash;This objection is not valid, the Sūtra points out, for the reason that those beings, viz. Indra and so on, again and again originate from the Vedic words. To explain. Vedic words, such as Indra and so on, do not, like the word Devadatta and the like, denote, on the basis of convention, one particular individual only: they rather denote by their own power particular species of beings, just as the word &amp;lsquo;cow&amp;rsquo; denotes a particular species of animals. When therefore a special individual of the class called Indra has perished, the creator, apprehending from the Vedic word &amp;lsquo;Indra&amp;rsquo; which is present to his mind the class characteristics of the beings denoted by that word, creates another Indra possessing&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Jaimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods, &amp;amp;c.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself for consideration, viz. whether the gods are qualified or not to undertake those meditations of which they themselves are the objects. The Sūtra states as a pūrvapaksha view held by Jaimini, that they are not so qualified, for the reason that there are no other Ādityas, Vasus, and so on, who could be meditated on by the Ādityas and Vasus themselves; and that moreover for the Ādityas and Vasus the qualities and position of those classes of deities cannot be objects of desire, considering that they possess them already. The so-called Madhuvidyā (Cḥ. Up. III) represents as objects of devout meditation certain parts of the sun which are being enjoyed by the different classes of divine beings, Vasus, Ādityas, and so on&amp;ndash;the sun being there called &amp;lsquo;madhu.&amp;rsquo; i.e. honey or nectar, on account of his being the abode of a certain nectar to be brought about by certain sacrificial works to be known from the R̥g-veda, and so on; and as the reward of such meditation the text names the attainment of the position of the Vasus, Ādityas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. IV, 4, 16). This text declares that the meditation of the gods has for its object the Light, i.e. the highest Brahman. Now this express declaration as to the gods being meditating devotees with regard to meditations on Brahman which are common to men and gods, implies a denial of the gods being qualified for meditations on other objects. The conclusion therefore is that the Vasus, and so on, are not qualified for meditations on the Vasus and other classes of deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;and its companion replies,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;He in whose work and knowledge there are comprised all the works done by good men and all the knowledge belonging to intelligent creatures, that is Raikva.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jānaśruti, having heard this speech of the flamingo&amp;ndash;which implied a reproach to himself as being destitute of the knowledge of Brahman, and a glorification of Raikva as possessing that knowledge&amp;ndash;at once sends his door-keeper to look for Raikva; and when the door-keeper finds him and brings word, the king himself repairs to him with six hundred cows, a golden necklace, and a carriage yoked with mules, and asks him to teach him the deity on which he meditates, i.e. the highest deity. Raikva, who through the might of his Yoga-knowledge is acquainted with everything that passes in the three worlds, at once perceives that Jānaśruti is inwardly grieved at the slighting speech of the flamingo, which had been provoked by the king&amp;rsquo;s want of knowledge of Brahman, and is now making an effort due to the wish of knowing Brahman; and thus recognises that the king is fit for the reception of that knowledge. Reflecting thereupon that a knowledge of Brahman may be firmly established in this pupil even without long attendance on the teacher if only he will be liberal to the teacher to the utmost of his capability, he addresses him: &amp;lsquo;Do thou take away (apāhara) (these things), O Śūdra; keep (the chariot) with the cows for thyself.&amp;rsquo; What he means to say is, &amp;lsquo;By so much only in the way of gifts bestowed on me, the knowledge of Brahman cannot be established in thee, who, through the desire for such knowledge, art plunged&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;34&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of (Jānaśruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first section of the vidyā tells us that Jānaśruti bestowed much wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages&amp;ndash;which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances suggest Jānaśruti&amp;rsquo;s being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the lowest caste.&amp;ndash;The above Sūtra having declared that the kshattriya-hood of Jānaśruti is indicated in the introductory legend, the next Sūtra shows that the same circumstance is indicated in the concluding legend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;35&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the inferential sign further on, together with Caitraratha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kshattriya-hood of Jānaśruti is further to be accepted on account of the Kshattriya Abhipratārin Caitraratha, who is mentioned further on in this very same Saṁvargavidyā which Raikva imparts to Jānaśruti.&amp;ndash;But why?&amp;ndash;As follows. The section beginning &amp;lsquo;Once a Brahmacārin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;begged of Saunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin Kākshaseni while being waited on at their meal,&amp;rsquo; and ending &amp;rsquo;thus do we, O Brahmacārin, meditate on that being,&amp;rsquo; shows Kāpeya, Abhipratārin, and the Brahmacārin to be connected with the Saṁvarga-vidyā. Now Abhipratārin is a Kshattriya, the other two are Brāhmaṇas. This shows that there are connected with the vidyā, Brāhmaṇas, and from among non-Brāhmaṇas, a Kshattriya only, but not a Śūdra. It therefore appears appropriate to infer that the person, other than the Brāhmaṇa Raikva, who is likewise connected with this vidyā, viz. Jānasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a Śūdra.&amp;ndash;But how do we know that Abhipratārin is a Caitraratha and a Kshattriya? Neither of these circumstances is stated in the legend in the Saṁvarga-vidyā! To this question the Sūtra replies, &amp;lsquo;on account of the inferential mark.&amp;rsquo; From the inferential mark that Śaunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin Kākshaseni are said to have been sitting together at a meal we understand that there is some connexion between Abhipratārin and the Kāpeyas. Now another scriptural passage runs as follows: &amp;lsquo;The Kāpeyas made Caitraratha perform that sacrifice&amp;rsquo; (Tāṇḍ Brā. XX, 12, 5), and this shows that one connected with the Kāpeyas was a Caitraratha; and a further text shows that a Caitraratha is a Kshattriya. &amp;lsquo;from him there was descended a Caitraratha who was a prince.&amp;rsquo; All this favours the inference that Abhipratārin was a Caitraratha and a Kshattriya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nor must you object to this on the ground that men knowing the Veda do not instruct Śūdras, and so on, because the text, &amp;lsquo;he is not to teach him sacred things,&amp;rsquo; forbids them to do so; for men who have once learned&amp;ndash;from texts such as &amp;lsquo;Thou art that&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;that Brahman is their Self, and thus are standing on the very top of the Veda as it were, move no longer in the sphere of those to whom injunctions and prohibitions apply, and the prohibition quoted does not&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having thus completed the investigation of qualification which had suggested itself in connexion with the matter in hand, the Sūtras return to the being measured by a thumb, and state another reason for its being explained as Brahman&amp;ndash;as already understood on the basis of its being declared the ruler of what is and what will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;40&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the trembling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the part of the Kaṭḥa-Upanishad which intervenes between the passage &amp;lsquo;The Person of the size of a thumb&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;41&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of light being seen (declared in the text).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between the two texts referring to the Person of the size of a thumb, there is a text declaring that to that Person there belongs light that obscures all other light, and is the cause and assistance of all other light; and such light is characteristic of Brahman only. &amp;lsquo;The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this fire. After him, the shining one, everything shines; by his light all this is lighted&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 5, 15)&amp;ndash;This very same śloka is read in the Ātharvaṇa (i.e.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;42&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ether, on account of the designation of something different, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read in the Cḥāndogya. &amp;lsquo;The ether is the evolver of forms and names. That within which these forms and names are (or &amp;ldquo;that which is within&amp;ndash;or without&amp;ndash;these forms and names&amp;rdquo;) is Brahman, the Immortal, the Self&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 14). A doubt here arises whether the being here called ether be the released individual soul, or the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin adopts the former view. For, he says, the released soul is introduced as subject-matter in an immediately preceding clause,&amp;lsquo;Shaking off all as a horse shakes his hair, and as the moon frees himself from the mouth of Rāhu; having shaken off the body I obtain, satisfied, the uncreated world of Brahman&amp;rsquo; Moreover, the clause &amp;lsquo;That which is without forms and names&amp;rsquo; clearly designates the released soul freed from name and form. And &amp;rsquo;the evolver of names and forms&amp;rsquo; is again that same soul characterised with a view to its previous condition; for the individual soul in its non-released state supported the shapes of gods, and so on, and their names. With a view, finally, to its present state in which it is free from name and form, the last clause declares &amp;rsquo;that is Brahman, the Immortal&amp;rsquo;. The term &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; may very well be applied to the released soul which is characterised by the possession of non-limited splendour.&amp;ndash;But, as the text under discussion is supplementary to the section dealing with the small ether within the heart (VIII, 1, 1 ff.), we understand that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;43&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of difference in deep sleep and departing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have to supply &amp;lsquo;on account of designation&amp;rsquo; from the preceding Sūtra. Because the text designates the highest Self as something different from the individual Self in the state of deep sleep as well as at the time of departure, the highest Self is thus different. For the Vājasaneyaka, after having introduced the individual Self in the passage &amp;lsquo;Who is that Self?&amp;ndash;He who consisting of knowledge is among the prāṇas,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (B_ri._ Up. IV, 3, 7), describes how, in the state of deep sleep, being not conscious of anything it is held embraced by the all-knowing highest Self, embraced by the intelligent Self it knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within&amp;rsquo; (IV, 3, 21). So also with reference to the time of departure, i.e. dying &amp;lsquo;Mounted by the intelligent Self it moves along groaning&amp;rsquo; (IV, 3, 35). Now it is impossible that the unconscious individual Self, either lying in deep sleep or departing from the body, should at the same time be embraced or mounted by itself, being all-knowing. Nor can the embracing and mounting Self be some other individual Self; for no such Self can be all-knowing.&amp;ndash;The next Sūtra supplies a further reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of beings, the protector of beings. He is a bank and a boundary so that these worlds may not be confounded. Brāhmaṇas seek to know him by the study of the Veda. He who knows him becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world only, mendicants leave their homes&amp;rsquo; (IV, 4, 22). &amp;lsquo;This indeed is the great unborn Self, the strong, the giver of wealth,&amp;ndash;undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless is Brahman&amp;rsquo; (IV, 4, 24; 25). Now all the qualities here declared, viz. being the lord of all, and so on, cannot possibly belong to the individual Self even in the state of Release; and we thus again arrive at the conclusion that&lt;/p&gt;</description>
