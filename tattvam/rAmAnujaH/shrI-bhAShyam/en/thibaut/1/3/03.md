3. Not that which is inferred, on account of the absence of terms denoting it, and (so also not) the bearer of the Prāṇas (i. e. the individual soul).

As the section under discussion does not treat of the Pradhāna, there being no terms referring to that, so it is with regard to the individual soul also. In the text of the Sūtra we have to read either anumānam, i. e. 'inference,' in the sense of 'object of inference,' or else ānumānam, 'object of inference'; what is meant being in both cases the Pradhana inferred to exist by the Sānkhyas.
