      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fourth-pāda&#34;&gt;FOURTH PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(On the soul&amp;rsquo;s) having approached (the highest light) there is manifestation; (as we infer) from the word &amp;lsquo;own.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūras now proceed to consider the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of superior existence (aiśvarya) which the released souls enjoy.&amp;ndash;The text says, &amp;lsquo;Thus does that serene being, having risen from the body and having approached the highest light, manifest itself in its own form&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3). Does this passage mean that the soul having approached the highest light assumes a new body, to be brought about then, as e.g. the body of a deva; or that it only manifests its own natural character?&amp;ndash;The text must be understood in the former sense, the Pūrvapakshin holds. For otherwise the scriptural texts referring to Release would declare what is of no advantage to man. We do not observe that its own nature is of any advantage to the soul. In the state of dreamless sleep the body and the sense-organs cease to act, and you may say the pure soul then abides by itself, but in what way does this benefit man? Nor can it be said that mere cessation of pain constitutes the well-being of the soul which has approached the highest light, and that in this sense manifestation of its own nature may be called Release; for Scripture clearly teaches that the released soul enjoys an infinity of positive bliss, &amp;lsquo;One hundred times the bliss of Prajāpati is one bliss of Brahman and of a sage free from desires&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;for having tasted a flavour he experiences bliss&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Nor can it be said that the true nature of the soul is consciousness of the nature of unlimited bliss which, in the Saṁsāra condition, is hidden by Nescience and manifests itself only when the soul reaches Brahman. For, as explained previously, intelligence which is of the nature of light cannot be hidden; hiding in that case would be neither more nor less than destruction. Nor can that which is mere light be of the nature of bliss; for bliss is pleasure, and to be of the nature&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the teaching of Prajāpati begins as follows: &amp;rsquo;the Self which is free from sin, free from old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, whose desires and thoughts spontaneously realise themselves.&amp;rsquo; And that this Self which forms the subject-matter of the entire section is the individual Self we have shown under I, 3, 19.

For Scriptural and Smr̥ti texts alike declare that the released soul stands to the highest Self in the relation of fellowship, equality, equality of attributes, and all this implies consciousness of separation. Compare &amp;lsquo;He attains all desires together with the all-knowing Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;When the seer sees the shining maker, the Lord, the Person who has his source in Brahman; then, possessing perfect knowledge, and shaking off good and evil, free from all passions he reaches the highest equality&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3); &amp;lsquo;Taking their stand upon this knowledge they, attaining to an equality of attributes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In (a nature like) that of Brahman, thus Jaimini thinks; on account of suggestion and the rest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Owing to the fact that different texts give different accounts, the question now arises of what character that essential nature of the Self is in which it manifests itself on reaching Brahman. Is that nature constituted by freedom from evil and sin and the rest (i.e. the attributes enumerated Cḥ. Up. VIII, 7, 1); or by mere intelligence (vijñāna); or by both, there being no opposition between intelligence and those other attributes?&amp;ndash;The teacher Jaimini holds that the soul manifests itself in its Brahman character, i.e. in a character constituted by freedom from sin, and so on. These latter attributes are, in the text of the &amp;lsquo;small lotus,&amp;rsquo; mentioned as belonging to Brahman (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5), and may hence be referred to as the &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; character. And that this Brahman character is the character of the released soul also follows from &amp;lsquo;suggestion and the rest.&amp;rsquo; For freedom from all evil and the rest are, in the teaching of Prajāpati, referred to as attributes of the soul (VIII, 7, 1). The &amp;lsquo;and the rest&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra refers to the activities of the released soul&amp;ndash;laughing, playing, rejoicing, and so on (mentioned in VIII, 12, 3)&amp;ndash;which depend on the power belonging to the soul in that state to realise all its ideas and wishes. It is for these reasons that Jaimini holds that mere intelligence does not constitute the true nature of the released soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the sole nature of intelligence; as that is its Self. Thus Auḍulomi thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence (consciousness; caitanya) alone is the true nature of the soul, and hence it is in that character only that the released soul manifests itself; this is the view of the teacher Auḍulomi. That intelligence only constitutes the true being of the soul, we learn from the express statement &amp;lsquo;As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste; so this Self has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 5, 13). When, therefore, the text attributes to the soul freedom from evil and the rest, it does not mean to predicate of it further positive qualities, but only&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus also, on account of existence of the former qualities (as proved) by suggestion, Bādarayaṇa holds absence of contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher Bādarāyaṇa is of opinion that even thus, i.e. although the text declares the soul to have mere intelligence for its essential nature, all the same the previously stated attributes, viz. freedom from all sin, and so on, are not to be excluded. For the authority of a definite statement in the Upanishads proves them to exist (&amp;lsquo;That Self which is free fiom sin,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.); and of authorities of equal strength one cannot refute the other. Nor must you say that the case is one of essential contradiction, and that hence we necessarily must conclude that freedom from sin, and so on (do not belong to the true nature of the soul, but) are the mere figments of Nescience (from which the released soul is free). For as there is equal authority for both sides, why should the contrary view not be held? (viz. that the soul is essentially free from sin, &amp;amp;c., and that the caitanya is non-essential.) For the principle is that where two statements rest on equal authority, that only which suffers from an intrinsic impossibility is to be interpreted in a different way (i.e. different from what it means on the face of it), so as not to conflict with the other. But while admitting this we deny that the text which describes the Self as a mass of mere knowledge implies that the nature of the Self comprises nothing whatever but knowledge.&amp;ndash;But what then is the purport of that text?&amp;ndash;The meaning is clear, we reply; the text teaches that the entire Self, different from all that is non-sentient, is self-illumined, i.e. not even a small part of it depends for its illumination on something else. The fact, vouched for in this text, of the soul in its entirety being a mere mass of knowledge in no way conflicts with the fact, vouched for by other texts, of its&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By the mere will; Scripture stating that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the released soul Scripture states, &amp;lsquo;He moves about there, laughing, playing, rejoicing, be it with women, or chariots, or relatives&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3). The doubt here arises whether the soul&amp;rsquo;s meeting with relatives and the rest presupposes an effort on its part or follows on its mere will&amp;ndash;as things spring from the mere will of the highest Person.&amp;ndash;An effort is required; for we observe in ordinary life that even such persons as kings and the like who are capable of realising all their wishes do not accomplish the effects desired without some effort.&amp;ndash;Against this view the Sūtra says &amp;lsquo;by the mere will.&amp;rsquo; For, in a previous passage, Scripture expressly says, &amp;lsquo;He who desires the world of the Fathers, by his mere will the Fathers rise to receive him,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (VIII, 2, 1). And there is no other text declaring the need of effort which would oblige us to define and limit the meaning of the text last quoted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For to be under a ruler means to be subject to injunction and prohibition, and to be such is opposed to being free in the realisation of all one&amp;rsquo;s wishes. Hence Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;he is a Self-ruler&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 25).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;wishes.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The teacher Bādari holds that body and sense-organs are absent; since the text declares this. The text&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;as long as he is embodied there is no freedom from pleasure and pain; but when he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 1)&amp;ndash;declares that pleasure and pain are necessarily connected with embodiedness; and the text&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;having risen from this body and reached the highest light he manifests himself in his own shape&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 12, 3)&amp;ndash;declares that the Released one is without a body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VII, 26, 2). The Self which is one and indivisible cannot be manifold, and the various forms of manifoldness of which the text speaks therefore must depend on the body. The text which speaks of the absence of a body refers to the absence of that body only which is due to Karman; for this latter body only is the cause of pleasure and pain. Next the Reverend Bādarāyaṇa decides this point by the declaration of his own view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This satisfies both kinds of texts. The case is analogous to that of the twelve days&amp;rsquo; sacrifice which, on the basis of twofold texts&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Those desirous of prosperity&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As in the state of dream the individual soul has experiences depending on chariots and other implements created by the Lord (&amp;lsquo;He creates chariots, horses,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 10); thus the released soul also may have experience of different worlds created by the Lord engaged in playful sport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But sometimes, again, the souls using their own creative will-power themselves create their own worlds, which however are included within the sphere of sport of the highest Person (so that the souls in enjoying them do not pass beyond the intuition of Brahman).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The entering is as in the case of a lamp; for thus Scripture declares.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as a lamp, although abiding in one place only, enters through the light proceeding from it into connexion with many places; so the soul also, although limited to one place, may through its light-like consciousness enter into several bodies. It may do this as well as in this life the soul, although abiding in one spot of the body only, viz. the heart, pervades the whole body by means of its consciousness and thus makes it its own. There is however the following difference between the two cases. The non-released soul has its intellectual power contracted by the influence of Karman, and hence is incapable of that expansive pervasion without which it cannot identify itself with other bodies. The released soul, on the other hand, whose intellectual power is non-contracted is capable of extending as far as it likes, and thus to make many bodies its own. For Scripture declares, &amp;lsquo;That living soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred times, and yet it is capable of infinity&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. V, 9). The non-released soul is ruled by Karman, the released one only by its will&amp;ndash;this is the difference.&amp;ndash;But, a new difficulty is raised, Scripture declares that when the soul reaches Brahman all its inner and outer knowledge is stopped: &amp;lsquo;Embraced by the highest Self the soul knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within &amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 21). How then can it be said to know all things?&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 15, 1). In both those states the soul attains to the highest Self and is unconscious. That in the states of deep sleep and dying the soul is unconscious and that the released soul is all-knowing, Scripture reveals. The text &amp;lsquo;In truth he thus does not know himself that he is I, nor does he know anything&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With the exception of world-energy; on account of leading subject-matter and of non-proximity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The doubt here presents itself whether the power of the released soul is a universal power such as belongs to the Supreme Person, extending to the creation, sustentation, and so on, of the worlds; or is limited to the intuition of the Supreme Person.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former view. For he says Scripture declares that the soul reaches equality with the Supreme Person: &amp;lsquo;Free from stain he reaches the highest equality&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3); and moreover Scripture ascribes to the released soul the power of realising all its thoughts. And these two conditions are not fulfilled unless the soul possess the special powers of the Lord with regard to the government, &amp;amp;c., of the world.&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies, &amp;lsquo;with the exception of world-energy.&amp;rsquo; The released soul, freed from all that hides its true nature, possesses the power of intuitively beholding the pure Brahman, but does not possess the power of ruling and guiding the different forms of motion and rest belonging to animate and inanimate nature.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;From subject-matter.&amp;rsquo; For it is with special reference to the highest Brahman&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that this is not so, on account of direct teaching; we reply not so, on account of the texts declaring that which abides within the spheres of those entrusted with special functions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, an objection is raised, certain texts directly declare that the released soul also possesses &amp;lsquo;world-energy.&amp;rsquo; Compare &amp;lsquo;He becomes a self-ruler; he moves in all worlds according to his wishes &amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 25, 2); &amp;lsquo;He moves through these worlds, enjoying any food he wishes, and assuming any shape he wishes&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. III, 10, 5). We cannot therefore accept the restriction laid down in the last Sūtra.&amp;ndash;Not so, the latter half of the present Sūtra declares, &amp;lsquo;on account of the texts declaring that which abides in the spheres of those entrusted with special functions.&amp;rsquo; The meaning of the texts quoted is that the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That which is not within change; for thus Scripture declares the abiding (of the soul).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That which is not within change, i.e. the highest Brahman which is free from all change and of an absolutely perfect and blessed nature&amp;ndash;this, together with the manifestations of its glory, is what forms the object of consciousness for the released soul. The worlds which are subject to change thus form objects for that soul&amp;rsquo;s experience, in so far as they form part of Brahman&amp;rsquo;s manifestation. For Scripture declares that the released soul thus abides within, i.e. is conscious of the changeless highest Brahman, &amp;lsquo;when he finds freedom from fear and an abode in that which is invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported, then he obtains the fearless&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7). And that the world is contained within Brahman as its manifestation is declared in the text, &amp;lsquo;In that all the worlds abide, and no one goes beyond&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. II, 5, 8). The meaning of the text stating that the Released freely move in all worlds, and similar texts, therefore is only that the released soul while conscious of Brahman with its manifestations experiences also the enjoyments, lying within the sphere of change, which abide in the world of Hiraṇyagarbha and similar beings; not that it possesses the world-energies&amp;ndash;creative, ruling, and so on&amp;ndash;which are the distinctive attribute of the highest Lord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;20&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And thus Perception and Inference show.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That the energies connected with the rule of the entire world are exclusive attributes of the highest Person, Scripture and Smr̥ti alike declare. Compare scriptural texts such as &amp;lsquo;From fear of him the wind blows,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); &amp;lsquo;By the command of that Imperishable one sun and moon stand, held apart&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. III, 9); &amp;lsquo;He is the lord of all, the king of all beings, the protector of all beings&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22). And Smr̥ti texts such as &amp;lsquo;With me as Supervisor, Prakr̥ti brings forth the Universe of the movable and the immovable, and for this reason the world ever moves round&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;Pervading this entire Universe by a portion of mine I do abide&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. IX, 10; X, 42). Scripture and Smr̥ti likewise declare that of the bliss which is enjoyed by the released soul the highest Person alone is the cause&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;For he alone causes blessedness&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7); &amp;lsquo;He who serves me with unswerving devotion, surpasses these qualities and is fitted for becoming one with Brahman. For I am the abode of Brahman, of infinite immortality, of everlasting virtue, and of absolute bliss&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XIV, 26-27). The exalted qualities of the soul&amp;ndash;freedom from evil and sin and so on&amp;ndash;which manifest themselves in the state of Release no doubt belong to the soul&amp;rsquo;s essential nature; but that the soul is of such a nature fundamentally depends on the Supreme Person, and on him also depends the permanency of those qualities; they are permanent in so far as the Lord himself on whom they depend is permanent. It is in the same way that all the things which constitute the means of enjoyment and sport on the part of the Lord are permanent in so far as the Lord himself is permanent. It thus appears that the equality to the Lord which the released soul may claim does not extend to the world-ruling energies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the indication of the equality of enjoyment only.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous conclusion is confirmed by the further fact that the text directly teaches the released soul to be equal to Brahman in so far only as enjoying direct insight into the true nature of Brahman. &amp;lsquo;He reaches all objects of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;desire, together with the all-knowing Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1).&amp;ndash;The conclusion thus is that we have to shape our ideas as to the powers of the released soul in accordance with what the texts say as to the Lord only possessing the power of ruling and controlling the entire world, and that hence the latter power cannot be attributed to the soul.&amp;ndash;But if the powers of the released soul altogether depend on the Lord, it may happen that He, being independent in all his doings, may will the released soul to return into the Sawsara.&amp;ndash;Of this doubt the next Sūtra disposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;22&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-return, according to Scripture; non-return, according to Scripture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We know from Scripture that there is a Supreme Person whose nature is absolute bliss and goodness; who is fundamentally antagonistic to all evil; who is the cause of the origination, sustentation, and dissolution of the world; who differs in nature from all other beings, who is all-knowing, who by his mere thought and will accomplishes all his purposes; who is an ocean of kindness as it were for all who depend on him; who is all-merciful; who is immeasurably raised above all possibility of any one being equal or superior to him; whose name is the &lt;em&gt;highest Brahman&lt;/em&gt;. And with equal certainty we know from Scripture that this Supreme Lord, when pleased by the faithful worship of his Devotees&amp;ndash;which worship consists in daily repeated meditation on Him, assisted by the performance of all the practices prescribed for each caste and āśrama&amp;ndash;frees them from the influence of Nescience which consists of karman accumulated in the infinite progress of time and hence hard to overcome; allows them to attain to that supreme bliss which consists in the direct intuition of His own true nature: and after that does not turn them back into the miseries of Saṁsāra. The text distinctly teaching this is &amp;lsquo;He who behaves thus all his life through reaches the world of Brahman and does not return&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 15). And the Lord himself declares &amp;lsquo;Having obtained me great-souled men do not come into rebirth, the fleeting abode of misery; for they have&lt;/p&gt;</description>
