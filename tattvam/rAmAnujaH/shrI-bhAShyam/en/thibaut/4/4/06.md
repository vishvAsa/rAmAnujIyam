6. In the sole nature of intelligence; as that is its Self. Thus Auḍulomi thinks.

Intelligence (consciousness; caitanya) alone is the true nature of the soul, and hence it is in that character only that the released soul manifests itself; this is the view of the teacher Auḍulomi. That intelligence only constitutes the true being of the soul, we learn from the express statement 'As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste; so this Self has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (Br̥. Up. IV, 5, 13). When, therefore, the text attributes to the soul freedom from evil and the rest, it does not mean to predicate of it further positive qualities, but only

to exclude all the qualities depending on avidyā--change, pleasure, pain, and so on--For these reasons Auḍulomi holds that the released soul manifests itself as mere intelligence.--Next the teacher Bādarāyaṇa determines the question by propounding his own view.
