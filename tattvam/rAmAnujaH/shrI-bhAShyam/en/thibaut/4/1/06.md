6. And the ideas of Āditya and the rest on the member; on account of this being rational.

'He who shines up there let a man meditate on him as the Udgītha' (Cḥ. Up. I, 3, 1).--With regard to this and similar meditations connected with subordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the doubt whether

the idea of Āditya and so on has to be superimposed on the subordinate part of the sacrifice, such as the Udgītha, or vice versā (i.e. whether Āditya should be meditated upon under the aspect of the Udgītha, or vice versā).--The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view. For the general principle is that the lower being should be viewed under the aspect of the higher, and the Udgītha and so on, which are parts of the sacrifices through which certain results are effected, are superior to the divinities who do not accomplish any result.--Of this view the Sūtra disposes. The ideas of Āditya and so on are to be superimposed on the 'members,' i.e. the Udgītha and so on, which are constituent members of the sacrifices; because of the gods only superiority can be established. For it is only through the propitiation of the gods that sacrifices are capable of bringing about their results. The Udgītha and the rest therefore are to be viewed under the aspect of Āditya and so on.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the ideas of Āditya and so on.'
