      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;second-pāda&#34;&gt;SECOND PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speech with mind, on account of this being seen and of scriptural statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras now begin an enquiry into the mode of the going to Brahman of him who knows. At first the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body is considered. On this point we have the text, &amp;lsquo;When a man departs from hence his speech is combined (sampadyate) with his mind, his mind with his breath, his breath with fire, fire with the highest deity&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 6, 1). The doubt here arises whether the speech&amp;rsquo;s being combined with the mind, referred to in the text, means that the function of speech only is merged in mind, or the organ of speech itself.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view; for, he says, as mind is not the causal substance of speech, the latter cannot be merged in it; while the scriptural statement is not altogether irrational in so far as the functions of speech and other organs are controlled by the mind, and therefore may be conceived as being withdrawn into it.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside. Speech itself becomes combined with mind; since that is seen. For the activity of mind is observed to go on even when the organ of speech has ceased to act.&amp;ndash;But is this not sufficiently accounted for by the assumption of the mere function of speech being merged in mind?&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies &amp;lsquo;and on account of the scriptural word.&amp;rsquo; The text says distinctly that speech itself, not merely the function of speech, becomes one with the mind. And when the function of speech comes to an end, there is no other means of knowledge to assure us that the function only has come to an end and that the organ itself continues to have an independent existence. The objection that speech cannot become one with mind because the latter is not the causal substance of speech, we meet by pointing out that the purport of the text is not that speech is merged in mind, but only that it is combined or connected with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And for the same reason all follow after.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because speech&amp;rsquo;s becoming one with mind means only conjunction with the latter, not merging within it; there is also no objection to what Scripture says as to all other organs that follow speech being united with mind.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;speech.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That mind in breath, owing to the subsequent clause.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That mind, i.e. mind united with all the organs unites itself with breath; not merely the function of mind. This appears from the clause following upon the text quoted above, &amp;lsquo;mind (unites itself) with breath.&amp;rsquo; Here, however, a further doubt suggests itself. The text &amp;lsquo;Mind is made of earth&amp;rsquo; declares earth to be the causal substance of mind, and the text &amp;rsquo;that (viz. water) sent forth earth&amp;rsquo; declares water to be the causal substance of earth; while the further text &amp;lsquo;breath is made of water&amp;rsquo; shows water to be the causal substance of breath. Considering therefore that in the text &amp;lsquo;mind becomes united with breath&amp;rsquo; the term &lt;em&gt;breath&lt;/em&gt; is naturally understood to denote the causal substance of breath, i.e. water, the appropriate sense to be given to the statement that mind is united with water is that mind is completely refunded into its own causal substance&amp;ndash;so that the &amp;lsquo;being united&amp;rsquo; would throughout be understood &amp;lsquo;as being completely merged.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;The reply to this, however, is, that the clauses &amp;lsquo;Mind is made of food, breath is made of water,&amp;rsquo; only mean that mind and breath are nourished and sustained by food and water, not that food and water are the causal substances of mind and breath. The latter indeed is impossible; for mind consists of ahaṁkāra, and as breath is a modification of ether and other elements, the word &lt;em&gt;breath&lt;/em&gt; may suggest water.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;mind.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That (is united) with the ruler, on account of the going to it, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As from the statements that speech becomes united with mind and mind with breath it follows that speech and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;mind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent clause &amp;lsquo;breath with fire&amp;rsquo; that breath becomes united with fire only.&amp;ndash;Against this primā facie view the Sūtra declares &amp;rsquo;that breath becomes united with the ruler of the organs, i.e. the individual soul, on account of the going to it, and so on.&amp;rsquo; That breath goes to the individual soul, the following text declares, &amp;lsquo;At the time of death all the prāṇas go to the Self of a man about to expire &amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 38), Similarly Scripture mentions the departure of prāṇa together with the soul, &amp;lsquo;after him thus departing the prawa departs&amp;rsquo;; and again its staying together with the soul, &amp;lsquo;What is that by whose departure I shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?&amp;rsquo; (Pr. Up. VI, 3). We therefore conclude that the text &amp;lsquo;breath with fire&amp;rsquo; means that breath joined with the individual soul becomes united with fire. Analogously we may say in ordinary life that the Yamuna is flowing towards the sea, while in reality it is the Yamuna joined with the Gangā which flows on.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the ruler.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Breath and soul unite themselves with all the elements; for Scripture declares the soul, when moving out, to consist of all the elements&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Consisting of earth, consisting of water, consisting of fire.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;But this latter text explains itself also on the assumption of breath and soul unitrng themselves in succession with fire and the rest, one at a time!&amp;ndash;This the next Sūtra negatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not with one; for both declare this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not with one; because each element by itself is incapable of producing an effect. Such incapability is declared by Scripture and tradition alike. The text &amp;lsquo;Having entered these beings with this jīva soul let me reveal names and forms&amp;ndash;let me make each of these three tripartite&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VI, 3) teaches that the elements were rendered tripartite in order to be capable of evolving names and forms; and of similar import is the following Smr̥ti text, &amp;lsquo;Possessing various powers these (elements), being separate from one another, were unable to produce creatures without combining. But having entered into mutual conjunction they, from the Mahat down to individual beings, produce the Brahma egg.&amp;rsquo; From this it follows that in the clause &amp;lsquo;breath is united with fire&amp;rsquo; the word &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt; denotes fire mixed with the other elements. Breath and soul therefore are united with the aggregate of the elements.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the elements.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And it is common up to the beginning of the way; and the immortality (is that which is obtained), without having burned.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this departure of the soul common to him who knows and him who does not know?&amp;ndash;It belongs to him only who does not know, the Pūrvapakshin holds. For Scripture declares that for him who knows there is no departure, and that hence he becomes immortal then and there (irrespective of any departure of the soul to another place), &amp;lsquo;when all desires which once dwelt in his heart are undone, then the mortal becomes immortal, then he obtains Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 7). This view the Sūtra sets aside. For him also who knows there is the same way of passing out up to the beginning of the path, i.e. previously to the soul&amp;rsquo;s entering the veins. For another text expressly declares that the soul of him also who knows passes out by way of a particular vein: &amp;rsquo;there are a hundred and one veins of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head; moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality, the others serve for departing in different directions&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 5). Scripture thus declaring that the soul of him who knows passes out by way of a particular vein, it must of course be admitted that it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; pass out; and as up to the soul&amp;rsquo;s entering the vein no difference is mentioned, we must assume that up to that moment the departure of him who knows does not differ from that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Since, up to the union with that (i.e. Brahman) the texts describe the Saṁsāra state.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The immortality referred to must necessarily be understood as not implying dissolution of the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with the body, since up to the soul&amp;rsquo;s attaining to Brahman the texts describe the Saṁsāra state. That attaining to Brahman takes place, as will be shown further on, after the soul&amp;ndash;moving on the path the first stage of which is light&amp;ndash;has reached a certain place. Up to that the texts denote the Saṁsāra state of which the connexion with a body is characteristic. &amp;lsquo;For him there is delay so long as he is not delivered (from the body); then he will be united&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 14, 2); &amp;lsquo;Shaking off all evil as a horse shakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Rāhu; having shaken off the body I obtain self, made and satisfied, the uncreated world of Brahman&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 13).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For Scripture states that he who knows, when on the path of the gods, enters into a colloquy with the moon and others, &amp;lsquo;he is to reply,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Kau. Up. I, 3 ff.). This implies the existence of a body, and thence it follows that, at that stage, the subtle body persists. The state of bondage therefore is not yet dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. IV, 4, 7), does not mean such immortality as would imply complete destruction of the state of bondage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now this warmth cannot really belong to the gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that body (while yet there is no reason why it should be limited to some part); but it may reasonably be attributed to the subtle body which may abide in some part of the gross body (and into which the warmth of the entire gross body has withdrawn itself). We therefore conclude that this partial perception of warmth is due to the departing subtle body. This confirms the view laid down in Sūtra 7.&amp;ndash;The next Sūtra disposes of a further doubt raised as to the departure of the soul of him who knows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that on account of the denial (it is not so); we deny this. From the embodied soul; for (that one is) clear, according to some.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The contention that the soul of him who knows departs from the body in the same way as other souls do cannot be upheld, since Scripture expressly negatives such departure. For Br̥. Up. IV, 4, at first describes the mode of departure on the part of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;He taking to himself those elements of light descends into the heart&amp;rsquo; up to &amp;lsquo;after him thus departing the Prāṇa departs&amp;rsquo;); then refers to his assuming another body (&amp;lsquo;he makes to himself another, newer and more beautiful shape&amp;rsquo;); then concludes the account of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;having attained the end of these works whatever he does here, he again returns from that world to this world of action. So much for the man who desires&amp;rsquo;); and thereupon proceeds explicitly to deny the departure from the body of him who possesses true knowledge, &amp;lsquo;But he who does not desire, who is without desire, free from desire, who has obtained his desire, who desires the Self only, of him (tasya) the prāṇas do not pass forth,&amp;ndash;being Brahman only he goes into Brahman.&amp;rsquo; Similarly a previous section also, viz. the one containing the questions put by Årtabhāga, directly negatives the view of the soul of him who knows passing out of the body. There the clause &amp;lsquo;he again conquers death&amp;rsquo; introduces him who knows as the subject-matter, and after that the text continues: &amp;lsquo;Yājñavalkya, he said, when that person dies, do the prāṇas pass out of him (asmāt) or not?&amp;ndash;No, said Yājñavalkya, they are gathered up in him (atraiva), he swells, inflated the dead lies&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. III, 2, 10-11). From these texts it follows that he who knows attains to immortality &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; (without his soul passing out of the body and moving to another place).&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra rejects. &amp;lsquo;Not so; from the embodied soul.&amp;rsquo; What those texts deny is the moving away of the prāṇas from the embodied individual soul, not from the body. &amp;lsquo;Of him (tasya) the prāṇas do not pass forth&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;here the &amp;lsquo;of him&amp;rsquo; refers to the subject under discussion, i.e. the embodied soul which is introduced by the clause &amp;lsquo;he who does not desire,&amp;rsquo; not to the body which the text had not previously mentioned. The sixth case (tasya) here denotes the embodied soul as&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With the Highest; for thus it says.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been shown that at the time of departure from the body the soul together with the organs and prāṇas unites itself with the subtle elements, fire and the rest; and the notion that the soul of him who knows forms an exception has been disposed of. The further question now arises whether those subtle elements move on towards producing their appropriate effects, in accordance with the works or the nature of meditation (of some other soul with which those elements join themselves), or unite themselves with the highest Self.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds that, as in the case of union with the highest Self, they could not give rise to their peculiar effects, i.e. the experience of pleasure and pain, they move towards some place where they can give rise to their appropriate effects.&amp;ndash;Of this view the Sūtra disposes. They unite themselves with the highest Self; for Scripture declares &amp;lsquo;warmth in the highest Being&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 8, 6). And the doings of those elements must be viewed in such a way as to agree with Scripture. As in the states of deep sleep and a pralaya, there is, owing to union with the highest Self, a cessation of all experience of pain and pleasure; so it is in the case under question also.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;union with the Highest.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-division, according to statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this union with the highest Self to be understood as ordinary &amp;lsquo;merging,&amp;rsquo; i.e. a return on the part of the effected thing into the condition of the cause (as when the jar is reduced to the condition of a lump of clay), or as absolute non-division from the highest Self, such as is meant in the clauses preceding the text last quoted, &amp;lsquo;Speech is merged in mind&amp;rsquo;? &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;The former view is to be adopted; for as the highest Self is the causal substance of all, union with it means the return on the part of individual beings into the condition of that causal substance.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra rejects. Union here means non-division, i.e. connexion of such kind that those subtle elements are altogether incapable of being thought and spoken of as separate from Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A lighting up of the point of the abode of that; having the door illuminated by that (the soul), owing to the power of its knowledge and the application of remembrance of the way which is an element of that (viz. of knowledge), being assisted by him who abides within the heart, (passes out) by way of the hundred and first artery.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far it has been shown that, up to the beginning of the journey, the souls of them as well who possess true knowledge as of those who do not, pass out of the body in the same way. Now a difference is stated in the case of those who have true knowledge. We have on this point the following text: &amp;lsquo;There are a hundred and one arteries of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head; moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality; the others serve for departing in different directions&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The doubt here arises whether he who knows departs by this hundred and first artery in the top of the head, while those who do not know depart by way of the other arteries; or whether there is no definite rule on this point.&amp;ndash;There is no definite rule, the Pūrvapakshin holds. For as the arteries are many and exceedingly minute, they are difficult to distinguish, and the soul therefore is not able to follow any particular one. The text therefore (is not meant to make an original authoritative statement as to different arteries being followed by&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Following the rays.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture teaches that the soul of him who knows, after having passed forth from the heart by way of the hundred and first artery, follows the rays of the sun and thus reaches the disc of the sun: &amp;lsquo;when he departs from this body he goes upwards by these rays only&amp;rsquo; (eva) (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The idea here suggests itself that the going of the soul cannot be exclusively bound&amp;rsquo; to those rays, since when a man dies during the night it &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; follow tae rays of the sun. Hence the text quoted above can refer only to a part of the actual cases.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra rejects. The soul moves upwards, following the rays only; the text expressly asserting this by means of the &amp;rsquo;eva&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which would be out of place were there any alternative. Nor is there any strength in the argument that the soul of him who dies at night cannot follow the rays as there are none. For in summer the experience of heat at night-time shows&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said, not in the night; we say, no; because the connexion persists as long as the body does. Scripture also declares this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is now enquired into whether the soul of him who, while having true knowledge, dies at night reaches Brahman or not. Although, as solar rays exist at night, the soul may move on at night also following those rays; yet, since dying at night is spoken of in the Sūtras as highly objectionable, we conclude that he who dies at night cannot accomplish the highest end of man, viz. attainment to Brahman. The Sūtras eulogize death occurring in daytime and object to death at night-time: &amp;lsquo;Day-time, the bright half of the month and the northern progress of the sun are excellent for those about to die; the contrary times are unfavourable.&amp;rsquo; According to this, their different nature, dying in day-time may be assumed to lead to a superior state of existence, and dying at night to an inferior state. He who dies at night cannot therefore ascend to Brahman.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra refutes: &amp;lsquo;Because, in the case of him who knows, the connexion with works exists as long as the body does.&amp;rsquo; This is to say&amp;ndash;since those works which have not yet begun to produce their results and which are the cause of future inferior states of existence are destroyed by the contact with knowledge, while at the same time later works do not&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the same reason also during the southern progress of the sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reasoning stated above also proves that the owner of true knowledge who may happen to die during the southern progress of the sun reaches Brahman. A further doubt, however, arises here. The text &amp;lsquo;He who dies during the sun&amp;rsquo;s southern progress reaches the greatness of the Fathers and union with the moon&amp;rsquo; (Mahānār. Up. 25) declares that he who dies during the southern progress reaches the moon; and the other text &amp;lsquo;when this ceases they return again the same way&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. VI, 2, 16) states that he returns again to the earth. We further know that Bhīshma and others, although fully possessing the knowledge of Brahman, put off their death until the beginning of the northern progress. All this seems to prove that he who dies during the southern progress does not reach Brahman.&amp;ndash;This doubt we dispose of as follows. Those only who do not possess true knowledge return from the moon; while he who has such knowledge does not return even after he has gone to the moon. For a complementary clause in the Mahānārāyaṇa Up., &amp;lsquo;from there he reaches the greatness of Brahman,&amp;rsquo; shows that the abode in the moon forms for him, who having died during the southern progress wishes to reach Brahman, a mere stage of rest. And even if there were no such complementary passage, it would follow from the previously stated absence of any&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In agreement herewith the text concludes, &amp;lsquo;Knowing these two paths no Yogin is ever deluded. Hence in all times, O Arjuna, be engaged in Yoga&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. VIII, 27). Through the terms &amp;rsquo;the fire, the light,&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;the smoke, the night,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. the path of the Gods and the path of the Fathers are recognised.
