There arises the further question whether breath joined with the soul unites itself with fire only or with all the elements combined.--With fire, so much only being declared by Scripture!--This view the Sūtra sets aside. Breath and soul unite themselves with all the elements; for Scripture declares the soul, when moving out, to consist of all the elements--'Consisting of earth, consisting of water, consisting of fire.'--But this latter text explains itself also on the assumption of breath and soul unitrng themselves in succession with fire and the rest, one at a time!--This the next Sūtra negatives.
