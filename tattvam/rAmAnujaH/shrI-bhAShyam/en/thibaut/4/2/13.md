13. Smr̥ti also declares this.

Smr̥ti also declares that the soul of him who knows departs by means of an artery of the head. 'Of those, one is situated above which pierces the disc of the sun and passes beyond the world of Brahman; by way of that the soul reaches the highest goal' (Yājñ. Smr̥. III, 167).--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'up to the beginning of the road.'
