3. Beyond lightning there is Varuṇa, on account of connexion.

According to the text of the Kaushītakins the soul goes on to the world of Vāyu, to the world of Varuṇa, to the world of Indra, to the world of Prajāpati, to the world of Brahman. The doubt here arises whether Varuṇa and the divinities of the following stages are to be inserted in the series after Vāyu, in agreement with the order of enumeration in the text of the Kaushītakins; or at the end of the whole series as stated in the Cḥāndogya. Up. (IV, 15, 5), Varuṇa thus coming after lightning.--The decision is in favour of the latter view because Varuṇa, the god of waters, is naturally connected with lightning which dwells within the clouds.--This terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'Varuṇa.'
