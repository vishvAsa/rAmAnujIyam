15. And Scripture declares the difference.

The text, 'He who meditates on name as Brahman, for him there is movement as he wishes as far as name extends,' &c. (Cḥ. Up. VII, 1 ff.), declares that those who meditate on the series of symbols beginning with name and ending with prāṇa attain to a result of limited nature and not depending on any particular path. Those therefore who meditate on the Intelligent either as mixed with the Non-intelligent or by itself, viewing it either under the aspect of Brahman or as separated from Brahman, are not led on by the conducting deities. On the other hand, it remains a settled conclusion that the deities speed on their way those who meditate on the highest Brahman and on the soul as separated from Prakr̥ti and having Brahman for its true Self.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the effected.'
