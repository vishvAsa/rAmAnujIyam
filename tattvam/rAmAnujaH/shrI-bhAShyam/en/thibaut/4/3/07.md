7. And on account of (Brahman) being specified.

The text 'a person not human leads them to the worlds of Brahman' (Br̥. Up. VI. 2, 15) by using the word 'world,' and moreover in the plural, determines the specification that the not-human person leads those only who meditate on Hiraṇyagarbha, who dwells within some particular world.

 Moreover, the text 'I enter the hall of Prajāpati, the house' (Cḥ. Up.VIII, 14) shows that he who goes on the path beginning with light aims at approaching Hiraṇyagarbha. But if this is so, there is a want of appropriate denotation in the clause, 'There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman'; if Hiraṇyagarbha is meant, the text should say 'He leads them to Brahmā (Brahmāṇam).'
