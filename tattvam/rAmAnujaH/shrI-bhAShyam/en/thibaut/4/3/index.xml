      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-pāda&#34;&gt;THIRD PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the path beginning with light, that being known.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras now go on to determine the road which the soul of the wise man follows, after having&amp;ndash;assisted by the Person within the heart&amp;ndash;passed out of the body by way of one particular artery. Now of that road various accounts are given in Scripture. There is a detailed account in the Cḥāndogya. (IV, 15), &amp;rsquo;now whether people perform obsequies for him or not,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. Another account is given in the eighth book of the same Upanishad,&amp;rsquo; then he moves upwards by those very rays &amp;rsquo; (VIII, 6, 5).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now the Reverend Bādarāyaṇa declares his own view, which constitutes the final conclusion in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Those not depending on symbols he leads, thus Bādarāyaṇa thinks; there being a defect in both cases; and he whose thought is that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bādarāyaṇa is of opinion that the deities lead those not depending on symbols, i.e. all meditating devotees other than those depending on symbols. That is to say. the view that those are led who meditate on the effected Brahman cannot be upheld; nor is there an exclusive rule that those only should be led on who meditate on the highest Brahman. The truth is that those are led who meditate on the highest Brahman, and also those who meditate on the Self (soul) as different from matter (Prakr̥ti) and having Brahman for its true Self. Souls of both these kinds are led on to Brahman. Those on the other hand whose object of meditation is such things as name and so on, which fall within what is a mere effect of Brahman&amp;ndash;such things being viewed either under the aspect of Brahman, just as some valiant man may be viewed under the aspect of a lion (which view expresses itself in the judgment &amp;lsquo;Devadatta is a lion &amp;lsquo;); or by themselves (without reference to Brahman)&amp;ndash;all those are not led on to Brahman. Why so?&amp;rsquo; Because there is a defect in both cases,&amp;rsquo; i.e. in both the views rejected by Bādarāyaṇa. The view that those are led who meditate on the effected Brahman is in conflict with texts such as &amp;rsquo; having risen from this body and reached the highest light&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3)&amp;ndash;for the nature of the fruit depends on the nature of the meditation; and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the year to Vāyu; on account of non-specification and specification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In their description of the path beginning with light the Cḥandogas mention the year between the months and the sun, &amp;lsquo;from the months to the year, from the year to the sun&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. V, 10, 1); while the Vājasaneyins mention, in that very place, the world of the Gods,&amp;lsquo;from the months to the world of the Gods, from the world of the Gods to the sun&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. VI, 2. 15). Now, as the two paths are identical, we have to supplement each by the additional item given in the other (and the question then arises whether the order of the stages be 1. months, 2. year, 3. world of the Gods, 4. sun; or 1. months, 2. world of the Gods, 3. year, 4. sun). The year and the world of the Gods are equally entitled&amp;ndash;to the place after the months in so far as textual declaration goes; for both texts say &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the months.&amp;rsquo; But we observe that the advance is throughout from the shorter periods of time to the longer ones (&amp;lsquo;from the day to the bright fortnight, from the bright fortnight to the six months of the northern progress&amp;rsquo;), and as therefore the year naturally presents itself to the mind immediately after the six months, we decide that the order is&amp;ndash;months, year, world of the Gods, sun.&amp;ndash;In another place (Br̥. Up. V, 10) the Vājasaneyins mention the wind as the stage preceding the sun (&amp;rsquo;the wind makes room for him&amp;ndash;he mounts upwards; he comes to the sun&amp;rsquo;). The Kaushītakins, on the other hand, place the world of the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beyond lightning there is Varuṇa, on account of connexion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the text of the Kaushītakins the soul goes on to the world of Vāyu, to the world of Varuṇa, to the world of Indra, to the world of Prajāpati, to the world of Brahman. The doubt here arises whether Varuṇa and the divinities of the following stages are to be inserted in the series after Vāyu, in agreement with the order of enumeration in the text of the Kaushītakins; or at the end of the whole series as stated in the Cḥāndogya. Up. (IV, 15, 5), Varuṇa thus coming after lightning.&amp;ndash;The decision is in favour of the latter view because Varuṇa, the god of waters, is naturally connected with lightning which dwells within the clouds.&amp;ndash;This terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;Varuṇa.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Conductors, this being indicated.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decision here is that light, Vāyu, and the rest mentioned in the texts as connected with the soul&amp;rsquo;s progress on the path of the Gods are to be interpreted not as mere marks indicating the road, nor as places of enjoyment for the soul, but as divinities appointed by the Supreme Person to conduct the soul along the stages of the road; for this is indicated by what the Cḥandogya. says with regard to the last stage, viz. lightning, &amp;lsquo;There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman.&amp;rsquo; What here is said as to that person not human, viz. that he leads the soul, is to be extended to the other beings also, light and the rest.&amp;ndash;But if that not human person leads the souls from lightning to Brahman, what then about Varuṇa, Indra, and Prajāpati, who, as was decided above, are in charge of stages beyond lightning? Do they also lead the soul along their stages?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Varuṇa, Indra, and Prajāpati take part in the work in so far only as they may assist the person connected with lightning.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the conductors.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Him who meditates on) the effected Brahman, (thus opines) Bādari; because for him going is possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following question now presents itself for consideration. Does the troop of conducting divinities, Agni and the rest, lead on those who meditate on the effected Brahman, i.e. Hiraṇyagarbha; or those only who meditate on the highest Brahman; or those who meditate on the highest Brahman and those who meditate on the individual Self as having Brahman for its Self?&amp;ndash;The teacher Bādari is of opinion that the divinities lead on those only who meditate on the effected Brahman. For he only who meditates on Hiraṇyagarbha can move; while a person meditating on the highest Brahman which is absolutely complete, all-knowing, present everywhere, the Self of all, cannot possibly be conceived as moving to some other place in order to reach Brahman; for him Brahman rather is something already reached. For him the effect of true knowledge is only to put an end to that Nescience which has for its object Brahman, which, in reality, is eternally reached. He, on the other hand,who meditates on Hiraṇyagarbha may be conceived as moving in ordfer to reach his object, which is something abiding within a special limited place. It is he therefore who is conducted on by Agni and the other escorting deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of (Brahman) being specified.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text &amp;lsquo;a person not human leads them to the worlds of Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. VI. 2, 15) by using the word &amp;lsquo;world,&amp;rsquo; and moreover in the plural, determines the specification that the not-human person leads those only who meditate on Hiraṇyagarbha, who dwells within some particular world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the text &amp;lsquo;I enter the hall of Prajāpati, the house&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.VIII, 14) shows that he who goes on the path beginning with light aims at approaching Hiraṇyagarbha. But if this is so, there is a want of appropriate denotation in the clause, &amp;lsquo;There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman&amp;rsquo;; if Hiraṇyagarbha is meant, the text should say &amp;lsquo;He leads them to Brahmā (Brahmāṇam).&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But on account of nearness there is that designation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hiraṇyagarbha is the first created being (as declared by the text &amp;lsquo;he who creates Brahma&amp;rsquo;); he thus stands near to Brahman, and therefore may be designated by the same term (viz. Brahman). This explanation is necessitated by the reasons set forth in the preceding Sūtras (which show that the real highest Brahman cannot be meant).&amp;ndash;But, if the soul advancing on the path of the Gods reaches Hiraṇyagarbha only, texts such as &amp;lsquo;This is the path of the Gods, the path of Brahman; those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. IV, 15, 6), and &amp;lsquo;moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 6, 6), are wrong in asserting that that soul attains to immortality and does not return; for the holy books teach that Hiraṇyagarbha, as a created being, passes away at the end of a dviparārdha-period; and the text &amp;lsquo;Up to the world of Brahman the worlds return again&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. VIII, 16) shows that those who have gone to Hiraṇyagarbha necessarily return also.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Highest, Jaimini thinks; on account of primariness of meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that those deities lead on the souls of those only who meditate on the highest Brahman. For in the text &amp;lsquo;a person not human leads them to Brahman&amp;rsquo; the word Brahman is naturally taken in its primary sense (i.e. the highest Brahman); the secondary sense (i.e. the effected Brahman) can be admitted only if there are other valid reasons to refer the passage to the effected Brahman. And the alleged impossibility of the soul&amp;rsquo;s going is no such valid reason; for although Brahman no doubt is present everywhere, Scripture declares that the soul of the wise frees itself from Nescience only on having gone to some particular place. That the origination of true knowledge depends on certain conditions of caste, āśrama, religious duty, purity of conduct, time, place, and so on, follows from certain scriptural texts, as e.g. &amp;lsquo;Brāhmaṇas desire to know him through the study of the Veda&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22); in the same way it follows from the text declaring the soul&amp;rsquo;s going to Brahman that the final realisation of that highest knowledge which implies the cessation of all Nescience depends on&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VIII, 12, 3).&amp;ndash;Against the contention that the text &amp;lsquo;I enter the hall of Prajāpati, the house&amp;rsquo; shows that he who proceeds on the path beginning with light aims at the effected Brahman, the next Sūtra argues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the complementary sentence &amp;lsquo;I am the glorious among Brāhmaṇas&amp;rsquo; shows that what the soul aims at is the condition of the universal Self, which has for its antecedent the putting off of all Nescience.

(Cḥ. Up. VII, 1 ff.), declares that those who meditate on the series of symbols beginning with name and ending with prāṇa attain to a result of limited nature and not depending on any particular path. Those therefore who meditate on the Intelligent either as mixed with the Non-intelligent or by itself, viewing it either under the aspect of Brahman or as separated from Brahman, are not led on by the conducting deities. On the other hand, it remains a settled conclusion that the deities speed on their way those who meditate on the highest Brahman and on the soul as separated from Prakr̥ti and having Brahman for its true Self.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the effected.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
