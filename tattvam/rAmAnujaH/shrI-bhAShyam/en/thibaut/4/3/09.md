9. On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahma), together with its ruler, (the souls go) to what is higher than that; on account of scriptural declaration.

On the passing away of the effected world of Brahma, together with its ruler Hiraṇyagarbha, who then recognises his qualification for higher knowledge, the soul also which had gone to Hiraṇyagarbha attains to true knowledge and thus reaches Brahman, which is higher than that,

i.e. higher than the effected world of Brahmā. This is known from the texts declaring that he who proceeds on the path of light reaches immortality and does not return; and is further confirmed by the text, 'They all, reaching the highest immortality, become free in the world of Brahman (Brahmā) at the time of the great end ' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6).
