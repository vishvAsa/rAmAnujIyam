8. If that be declared on account of name; (we object, since) that is also (where the objects of injunction differ).

If the oneness of the vidyās be maintained on the ground that both have the same name, viz. udgītha-vidyā, we point out that oneness is found also where the objects enjoined are different. The term agnihotra is applied equally to the permanent agnihotra and to that agnihotra which forms part of the sacrifice called 'Kuṇḍapāyinām ayanam'; and the term udgītha is applied equally to the many different meditations described in the first prapāṭḥaka of the Cḥāndogya.
