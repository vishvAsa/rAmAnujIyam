62. And on account of the declaration of a quality being common (to all the Vedas).

The text 'By means of that syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Oṁ the Adhvaryu gives orders,

with Oṁ the Hotr̥ recites, with Oṁ the Udgātr̥ sings,' which declares the praṇava--which is a 'quality' of the meditation, in so far as it is its basis--to be common to the three Vedas, further shows that the meditation has to be employed in connexion with the sacrifice. For the meditation is connected with the Udgītha, and the Udgitha is an integral part of all sacrificial performances whatever.

Of the primā facie view thus far set forth the next Sūtra disposes.
