61. On account of rectification.

The text 'from the seat of the Hotr̥ he sets right the wrong Udgīha' shows that the meditation is necessarily required for the purpose of correcting whatever mistake may be made in the Udgītha. This also proves that the meditation is an integral part of the sacrificial performance.
