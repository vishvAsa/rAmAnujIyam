54. Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the rest.

The 'or' here has the sense of 'and.' The 'and the rest' comprises generic characteristics, qualities, number, similarity, order of succession, substances, and actions. As there is nothing contrary to reason in mantras and the rest, although mentioned in the text of one śākhā only, finding, on the basis of such means of proof as direct statement, and so on, their application in all śākhās, since the sacrifice to which they belong is one and the same in all śākhās; so there is likewise no contradiction in the meditations under discussion being undertaken by members of all śākhās.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'what is connected with constituent elements of the sacrifice.'
