      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-pāda&#34;&gt;THIRD PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is understood from all the Vedānta-texts (is one), on account of the non-difference of injunction and the rest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras have stated whatever has to be stated to the end of rousing the desire of meditation-concluding with the fact that Brahman bestows rewards. Next the question is introduced whether the vidyās (i.e. the different forms of meditation on Brahman which the Vedānta-texts enjoin) are different or non-different, on the decision of which question it will depend whether the qualities attributed to Brahman in those vidyās are to be comprised in one act of meditation or not.&amp;ndash;The first subordinate question arising here is whether one and the same meditation&amp;ndash;as e.g. the vidyā of Vaiśvānara&amp;ndash;which is met with in the text of several śākhās, constitutes one vidyā or several.&amp;ndash;The vidyās are separate, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for the fact that the same matter is, without difference, imparted for a second time, and moreover stands under a different heading&amp;ndash;both which circumstances necessarily attend the text&amp;rsquo;s being met with in different śākhās&amp;ndash;proves the difference of the two meditations. It is for this reason only that a restrictive injunction, such as the one conveyed in the text, &amp;lsquo;Let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only who have performed the rite of carrying fire on their head&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 2, 10)&amp;ndash;which restricts the impaiting of knowledge to the Ātharvaṇikas, to whom that rite is peculiar&amp;ndash;has any sense; for if the vidyās were one, then the rite mentioned, which is a part of the vidyā, would be valid for the members of other śākhās also, and then the restriction enjoined by the text would have no meaning.&amp;ndash;This view is set aside by the Sūtra, &amp;lsquo;What is understood from all the Vedānta-texts&amp;rsquo; is one and the same meditation, &amp;lsquo;because there is non-difference of injunction and the rest.&amp;rsquo; By injunction is meant the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said (that the vidyās are not one) on account of difference, we deny this, since even in one (vidyā there may be repetition).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it be said that there is no oneness of vidyā, because the fact of the same matter being stated again without difference, and being met with in a different chapter, proves the object of injunction to be different; we reply that even in one and the same vidyā some matter may be repeated without any change, and under a new heading (in a different chapter); if, namely, there is difference of cognising subjects. Where the cognising person is one only, repetition of the same matter under a new heading can only be explained as meaning difference of object enjoined, and hence separation of the two vidyās. But where the cognising persons are different (and this of course is eminently so in the case of different śākhās), the double statement of one and the same matter explains itself as subserving the cognition of those different persons, and hence does not imply difference of matter enjoined.&amp;ndash;The next Sūtra&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For (the śirovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also on account of (that rite) being a heading in the samācāra; and the restriction is like that of the libations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the text says as to a restriction connected with the &amp;lsquo;vow of the head,&amp;rsquo; does not intimate a difference of vidyās. For that vow does not form part of the vidyā. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of the &lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt; of the Veda on the part of the Ātharvaṇikas, being meant to establish that they should possess that special qualification which the rite produces; but it does not affect the vidyā itself. This is proved by the subsequent clause, &amp;lsquo;a man who has not performed that rite may not &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the text,&amp;rsquo; which directly connects the rite with the studying of the text. And it is further proved by the fact that in the book of the Ātharvaṇikas, called &amp;lsquo;sāmācara, &amp;rsquo;that rite is referred to as a rite connected with the Veda (not with the special vidyā set forth in the Muṇḍaka), viz. in the passage, &amp;rsquo;this is explained already by the Veda-observance&amp;rsquo; (which extends the details of the śirovrata, there called veda-vrata, to other observances). By the &lt;em&gt;knowledge of Brahman&lt;/em&gt; (referred to in the Muṇḍaka-text &amp;rsquo;let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.), we have therefore to understand knowledge of the Veda in general. And that restriction is &amp;rsquo;like that of the libations&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;i.e. it is analogous to the restriction under which the sava-libations, beginning with the Saptasūrya-libation, and terminating with the Śataudana-libation, are offered in the one fire which is used by the followers of the Atharvan, and not in the ordinary three fires.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scripture also declares this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture also shows that (identical) meditation is what all the Vedānta-texts intimate. The Cḥāndogya (VIII, 1, 1 ff.) declares that that which is within the small space in the heart is to be enquired into, and then in reply to the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;question what the thing to be enquired into is, says that it is the highest Self possessing the eight attributes, freedom from all evil and the rest, which is to be meditated upon within the heart. And then the Taittiriya-text, referring to this declaration in the Cḥāndogya, says, &amp;lsquo;Therein is a small space, free from all grief; what is within that is to be meditated upon&amp;rsquo; (Mahānār. Up. X, 23), and thus likewise enjoins meditation on the highest Self possessing the eight qualities. And this is possible only if, owing to unity of vidya, the qualities mentioned in the first text are included also in the meditation enjoined in the second text.&amp;ndash;Having thus established the unity of meditations, the Sūtras proceed to state the practical effect of such unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination (of guṇas); on account of non-difference of purport in the case of what subserves injunction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meditation in all Vedānta-texts thus being the same, the qualities mentioned in one text are to be combined with those mentioned in another; &amp;lsquo;on account of non-difference of purport in the case of what subserves injunction.&amp;rsquo; We find that in connexion with certain injunctions of meditation&amp;ndash;such as the meditation on Vaiśvānara, or the small ether within the heart&amp;ndash;the text of some individual Vedānta-book mentions certain secondary matters (qualities, guṇa) which subserve that meditation; and as these guṇas are connected with the meditation they are to be comprised in it, so that they may accomplish their aim, i.e. of subserving the meditation. For the same reason therefore we have to enclose in the meditation guṇas mentioned in other Vedānta-texts; for being also connected with the meditation they subserve it in the same way.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;what is intimated by all Vedānta-texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we say no; on account of non-difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far it has been shown that the non-difference of injunction,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and so on, establishes the unity of meditations, and that owing to the latter the special features of meditation enjoined in different texts have to be combined. Next, an enquiry is entered upon whether in the case of certain particular meditations there actually exists, or not, that non-difference of injunction which is the cause of meditations being recognised as identical. A meditation on the Udgītha is enjoined in the text of the Cḥandogas, as well as in that of the Vājasaneyins (Cḥ. Up. I, 2; Br̥. Up. I, 3); and the question arises whether the two are to be viewed as one meditation or not. The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, there is no difference of injunction, and so on, since both texts enjoin as the object of meditation the Udgītha viewed under the form of Prāṇa; since there is the same reward promised in both places, viz. mastering of one&amp;rsquo;s enemies; since the form of meditation is the same, the Udgītha being in both cases viewed under the form of Prāṇa; since the injunction is the same, being conveyed in both cases by the same verbal root (vid, to know); and since both meditations have the same technical name, viz. udgītha-vidyā. The Sūtra states this view in the form of the refutation of an objection raised by the advocate of the final view. We do not admit, the objector says, the unity maintained by you, since the texts clearly show a difference of form. The text of the Vājasaneyins represents as the object of meditation that which is the agent in the act of singing out the Udgītha; while the text of the Cḥandogas enjoins meditation on what is the object of the action of singing out (i. e. the Udgītha itself). This discrepancy establishes difference in the character of the meditation, and as this implies difference of the object enjoined, the mere non-difference of injunction, and so on, is of no force, and hence the two meditations are separate ones.&amp;ndash;This objection the Pūrvapakshin impugns, &amp;lsquo;on account of non-difference.&amp;rsquo; For both texts, at the outset, declare that the Udgītha is the means to bring about the conquest of enemies (Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices by means of the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up.); &amp;lsquo;The gods took the Udgītha,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case of the attribute of being higher than the high, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no unity of the two vidyās, since the subject-matter of the two differs. For the tale in the Cḥāndogya-text, which begins &amp;lsquo;when the Devas and the Asuras struggled together,&amp;rsquo; connects itself with the praṇava (the syllable Om) which is introduced as the object of meditation in Cḥánd. I, 1, 1, &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgītha&amp;rsquo;; and the clause forming part of the tale,&amp;rsquo;they meditated on that chief breath as Udgītha.&amp;rsquo; therefore refers to a meditation on the praṇava which is a part only of the Udgītha. In the text of the Vāja-saneyins; on the other hand, there is nothing to correspond to the introductory passage which in the Cḥāndogya-text determines the subject-matter, and the text clearly states that the meditation refers to the whole Udgītha (not only the praṇava). And this difference of leading subject-matter implies difference of matter enjoined, and this again difference of the character of meditation, and hence there is no unity of vidyās. Thus the object of meditation for the Cḥandogas is the praṇava viewed under the form of Prāṇa; while for the Vājasaneyins it is the Udgātri (who sings the Udgītha), imaginatively identified with Prāṇa. Nor does there arise, on this latter account, a contradiction between the later and the earlier part of the story of the Vājasaneyins. For as a meditation on the Udgātr̥ necessarily&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The term agnihotra is applied equally to the permanent agnihotra and to that agnihotra which forms part of the sacrifice called &amp;lsquo;Kuṇḍapāyinām ayanam&amp;rsquo;; and the term udgītha is applied equally to the many different meditations described in the first prapāṭḥaka of the Cḥāndogya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cḥāndogya and the Vajasaneyaka alike record a meditation on Praṇa; the object of meditation being Praṇa as possessing the qualities of being the oldest and the best, and also as possessing certain other qualities such as being the richest, and so on (Cḥ. Up. V, 1; Br̥. Up. VI, 1). In the text of the Kaushītakins, on the other hand, there is a meditation on Prāṇa which mentions the former qualities (&amp;lsquo;being the best&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being the oldest&amp;rsquo;), but not the latter (&amp;lsquo;being the richest,&amp;rsquo; and so on). This,the Pūrvapakshin maintains, constitutes a difference between the objects of meditation, and hence between the meditations themselves.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside &amp;lsquo;on account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.&amp;rsquo; There is no difference of meditation. Those qualities, viz. being the richest, and so on, are to be meditated upon in the other place also, viz. in the meditation on Prāṇa of the Kaushītakins; &amp;lsquo;since there is non-difference of everything,&amp;rsquo; i.e. since the text of the Kaushītakins also exhibits the very same method, in all its details, for proving what it is undertaken to prove, viz. that Prāṇa is the oldest and best. And for that proof it is required that Prāṇa should be viewed as possessing also the quality of being the richest, and so on, and these qualities therefore have to be comprised in the meditation of the Kaushītakins also. Hence there is no difference of meditation.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;non-difference of everything.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The clause, &amp;lsquo;on account of non-difference,&amp;rsquo; has to be carried on from the preceding Sūtra. As the &amp;lsquo;subject of the qualities,&amp;rsquo; i.e. Brahman is the same in all meditations, the qualities which do not exist apart from their subject, viz. bliss, and so on, are to be comprised in all meditations.&amp;ndash;But for the same reason then such qualities as &amp;lsquo;having joy for its head&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 5) would also have to be included in all meditations on Brahman!&amp;ndash;This the next Sūtra negatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the latter are not qualities of Brahman, since they are mere elements in a figurative representation of Brahman under the form of an animal body. Otherwise, i.e. if Brahman really possessed different members, such as head, wings, and so on, it would be liable to increase&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To this class belong qualities such as true being, knowledge, bliss, purity, infinity, and so on. For of Brahman&amp;ndash;which by texts such as &amp;rsquo;that from which all these beings,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. had been suggested as the cause of the world&amp;ndash;the essential definition is given in texts such as &amp;rsquo;the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;bliss is Brahman,&amp;rsquo; and others; and hence, in order that a true notion may be formed of Brahman as the object of meditation, such qualities as true being, bliss, and so on, have to be included in all meditations on Brahman. Such additional qualities, on the other hand, as e.g. compassion, which indeed cannot exist apart from the subject to which they belong, but are not necessary elements of the idea of Brahman, are to be included in those meditations only where they are specially mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In order to accomplish the meditation on Brahman which is enjoined in the text &amp;lsquo;he who knows (i.e. meditates on) Brahman reaches the Highest,&amp;rsquo; the text represents the Brahman consisting of bliss as made up of joy, satisfaction, &amp;amp;c., and compares these to the head, the wings, and so on. The Self of bliss, which is the inmost of all the Selfs mentioned in the text, is by this means represented to the mind in a definite shape; just as in the preceding sections the Self of food, the Self of breath, and the rest had similarly been represented in definite shapes, consisting of head, wings, and so on. As thus the qualities of having joy for its head, &amp;amp;c. are merely secondary marks of the Self of bliss, they are not necessarily included in each meditation that involves the idea of that Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For as the Self cannot really possess a head, wings, and tail, its having joy for its head, and so on, can only be meant in a metaphorical sense, for the sake of easier comprehension.&amp;ndash;But, in the preceding sections, the term &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt; had been applied to what is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of the nature of Self&amp;ndash;the text speaking of the Self of breath, the Self of mind, and so on; how then are we able to determine that in the phrase &amp;rsquo;the Self of bliss&amp;rsquo; the term&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both texts&amp;ndash;the Cḥāndogya as well as the Vājasaneyaka-declare that water constitutes a dress for praṇa, and refer to the rinsing of the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;with water. The doubt here arises whether what the texts mean to enjoin is the rinsing of the mouth, or a meditation on prāṇa as having water for its dress.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, the Vājasaneyaka uses the injunctive form &amp;lsquo;he is to rinse,&amp;rsquo; while there is no injunctive form referring to the meditation; and what the text says in praise of the breath thus not being allowed to remain naked may be taken as a mere glorification of the act of rinsing. And as ordinary rinsing of the mouth, subsequent to eating, is already established by Smr̥ti and custom, we must conclude that the text means to enjoin rinsing of the mouth of a different kind, viz. as auxiliary to the meditation on prāṇa.&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies that what the text enjoins is the new&amp;rsquo; thing, i.e. the previously non-established meditation on water as forming the dress of prāṇa. &amp;lsquo;On account of the statement of what has to be done,&amp;rsquo; i.e. on account of the statement of what is not established&amp;ndash;for only on the latter condition Scripture has a meaning. The beginning as well as the end of the Vājasaneyaka-text clearly refers to a meditation on the water used for rinsing as forming a dress for prāṇa; and as rinsing is already established by Smr̥ti and custom, we naturally infer that what the text enjoins is a meditation on breath as having the water used in rinsing for its dress. This also explains why the Cḥāndogya-text does not mention the rinsing at all, but merely the clothing of breath with water.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the statement of what has to be done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pūrvapakshin holds that these two meditations are different since the latter text mentions qualities&amp;ndash;such as Brahman being the lord of all&amp;ndash;which are not mentioned in the former; the objects of meditation thus being different, the meditations themselves are different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here the Pūrvapakshin holds that both these names are to be comprehended in each of the two meditations &amp;lsquo;On account of connexion,&amp;rsquo; i.e. on account of the object of meditation, i.e. Brahman being one only, although connected with different abodes, it is &amp;rsquo;thus elsewhere also,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the same conclusion which had been arrived at in the case of the Śāṇḍilya-vidyās, has to be accepted with regard to Brahman abiding in the sun and in the eye. The meditation is one only, and hence the two secret names apply to Brahman in both its abodes.&amp;ndash;This view the next Sūtra negatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Brahman was born as the first of all beings; who may rival that Brahman?&amp;rsquo; which declares that Brahman gathered together all the most ancient powers, that it pervades the sky, and so on. And as these attributes are not stated in connexion with any special meditation, we must infer that they are to be included in all meditations whatever on Brahman.&amp;ndash;This primā facie view is controverted by the Sūtra. The holding together of all powers, &amp;amp;c., although not mentioned in connexion with any special meditation, is not to be included in all meditations whatever, but to be connected with particular meditations &amp;lsquo;on the same ground,&amp;rsquo; i.e. according to difference of place. &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; those qualities have to be included must be decided on the ground of feasibility. The attribute of pervading the whole heaven cannot be included in a meditation on Brahman as abiding within a small place such as the heart, and hence the other attributes also which are stated together with the attribute mentioned cannot be included in those meditations. And when we find that in meditations on Brahman as abiding within a small place it is said that Brahman is greater than the earth, or that the ether within the heart is as great as the universal ether, these attributes cannot be taken in their literal sense and hence included in those meditations, but must be viewed as merely meant to glorify the object proposed for meditation.&amp;ndash;Herewith terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;holding together.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although both meditations are meditations on man, yet they are separate &amp;lsquo;on account of the others not being recorded,&amp;rsquo; i.e. on account of the qualities recorded in one śākhā not being recorded in the other. For the Taittirīyaka mentions the three libations, while the Cḥāndogya does not, and so on. The character of the two meditations thus differs. And there is a difference of result also. For an examination of the context in the Taittirīyaka shows that the purusha-vidyā is merely a subordinate part of a meditation on Brahman, the fruit of which the text declares to be that the devotee reaches the greatness of Brahman; while the Cḥāndogya meditation is an independent one, and has for its reward the attainment of long life. The two meditations are thus separate, and hence the details of one must not be included in the other.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the meditation on man.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;26&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But in the case of the getting rid of (it has to be combined with the obtaining), as it is supplementary&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to statements of obtaining; as in the case of the kuśas, the metres, the praise, and the singing. This has been explained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cḥandogas read in their text &amp;lsquo;Shaking off all evil as a horse shakes his hair, and shaking off the body as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Rāhu, I obtain the world of Brahman &amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 13). The Ātharvaṇikas have &amp;lsquo;He who knows, shaking off good and evil, free from passion, reaches the highest oneness.&amp;rsquo; The Śāṭyāyanins have &amp;rsquo; His sons obtain his inheritance, his friends the good, his enemies the evil he has done.&amp;rsquo; The Kaushītakins &amp;lsquo;He shakes off his good and his evil deeds. His beloved relatives obtain the good, his unbeloved relatives the evil he has done.&amp;rsquo; Two of these texts mention only the shaking off, on the part of him who knows, of his good and evil woiks; one mentions only the obtainment of these works, on the part of friends and enemies; and one mentions both these occurrences.&amp;ndash;Now both the occurrences, although mentioned in several meditations, must be considered elements of all meditations: for whoever, on the basis of a knowledge of Brahman, reaches Brahman, necessarily leaves behind all his good and evil works, and those works unless thus left behind cannot be obtained by others. Meditation on those two matters therefore enters as an element into all meditations. The doubtful point, however, is whether there is option between the meditation on the abandonment of works, and that on the obtainment of works by others, and that on both these events; or whether in each case all these meditations are to be combined.&amp;ndash;There is option, the Pūrvapakshin holds; for the reason that the texts make different declarations on this point. For, if the meditations had to be combined, there would be in each case meditation on both the matters mentioned; and as such double meditation is established by the Kaushitakin text, it would follow that the statements of the other texts are without meaning. Thus the only motive for the declarations made in different places can be to allow option. Nor must this conclusion be controverted on the ground that declarations of the same&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;27&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At departing; there being nothing to be reached. For thus others (also declare).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The further question arises whether the putting off of all good and evil deeds takes place only at the time when the soul leaves the body, or also after it has departed and is on its journey to the world of Brahman. The Pūrvapakshin holds the latter view, for, he says, the texts declare both. The Kaushītakins say that the soul shakes off its good and evil deeds when it crosses the river Virajā in the world of Brahman; while the Tāṇdins say &amp;lsquo;Shaking off all evil, and shaking off the body,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., which shows that the deeds are shaken off at the time when the soul leaves the body. And when the Śāṭyāyanaka says that &amp;lsquo;his sons obtain his inheritance, his friends his good deeds,&amp;rsquo; and so on, this also intimates that the deeds are shaken off at the time when the soul leaves the body. We therefore must conclude that a part of the deeds is left behind at the moment of death, and the remainder on the journey to the world of Brahman.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra controverts. All the good and evil deeds of the dying man are left behind, without remainder, at the time when the soul parts from the body. For after the soul of him who knows has departed from the body, &amp;rsquo;there is nothing to be reached,&amp;rsquo; i.e. there are no further pleasures and pains to be enjoyed as the result of good and evil deeds, different from the obtaining of Brahman, which is the fruit of knowledge. Thus others &amp;lsquo;also declare that, subsequently to the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body, there is no enjoyment of any pain or pleasure different from the obtaining of Brahman. &amp;lsquo;But when he is free of the body, then neither pleasure nor pain&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Thus in the text of the Kaushītakins the later clause, &amp;lsquo;he shakes off his good and evil deeds,&amp;rsquo; must be taken as coming before the earlier passage &amp;lsquo;having entered on that path of the gods.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Here the Pūrvapakshin raises a new objection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is meaning of the soul&amp;rsquo;s going (only) on the twofold hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradiction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is only on the hypothesis of a part of the good and evil works being left behind at the time of the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body, and another part later on, and the effacement of works thus taking place in a double way, that a sense can be found in the scriptural declaration of the soul proceeding on the path of the gods. For otherwise there would be a contradiction. For if all the works perished at the time of the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body, the subtle body also would perish, and if this were so, no going on the part of the mere Self would be possible. It is not therefore possible that at the time of the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body all works should perish without a remainder.&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;30&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(That assumption) is justified; on account of the perception of things which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The assumption of all the works perishing at the time of &amp;lsquo;departure&amp;rsquo; involves no contradiction; since we perceive, in the sacred texts, matters which are marks of connexion with a body even on the part of the soul which has divested itself of all its works and become manifest in its true nature. Compare &amp;lsquo;Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his true form&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He moves about there laughing, playing, and rejoicing&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He becomes a self-ruler, he moves about in all worlds according to his will&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He becomes one, he becomes three,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3; VII, 25, 2; 26, 2). All these texts refer to the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with a body. The soul therefore, joined to the subtle body, may proceed on the path of the gods, even after all its works have passed away. But how can the subtle body persist, when the works which originate it have passed away? Through the power of knowledge, we reply. Knowledge does not indeed by itself originate the subtle body, but it possesses the power of making that body persist, even after the gross body&amp;ndash;which is the instrument for the experience of all ordinary pains and pleasures&amp;ndash;and all works have passed away, so as thereby to make the soul capable of moving on the path of the gods, and thus to obtain Brahman which is the fruit of knowledge. &amp;lsquo;As in ordinary life.&amp;rsquo; As in ordinary life, a tank, which may have been made with a view to the irrigation of rice-fields and the like, is maintained and used for the purpose of drawing drinking-water, and so on, even after the intentions which originally led to its being made have passed away.&amp;ndash;Here an objection is raised. It may be admitted, that at the time when a man possessing true knowledge dies, all his works pass away without a remainder, and that the subtle body only remains, enabling him to move towards Brahman; but it cannot be held that the soul in that state does not experience pain and pleasure; for we know from sacred tradition that Vasishṭḥa, Avāntara-tamas, and others, who had reached intuition of the highest truth, entered after death on other embodiments, and experienced pain and pleasure due to the birth of sons, various calamities, and so on.&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Persons like Vasishṭḥa, on the other hand, who are entrusted with certain offices, do not immediately after death attain to moving on the path beginning with light, since the duties undertaken by them are not completely accomplished. In the case of beings of this kind, who owing to particular deeds have been appointed to particular offices, the effect of the works which gave rise to the office does not pass away before those offices are completely accomplished; for the effect of a work is exhausted only through the complete enjoyment of its result. In the case of those persons, therefore, the effects of the works which gave rise to their office continue to exist as long as the office itself, and hence they do not after death enter on the path beginning with light.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;passing away.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;32&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no restriction (since) all (have to go on that path). (Thus) there is non-contradiction of sacred text and Smr̥ti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question here is whether Brahman is to be reached on the path of the gods by those only who take their stand on those meditations which, like the Upakośala-vidyā, describe that path, or by all who practise any of the meditations on Brahman. The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view, since there is no proof to show that in other vidyās the going on that path is not mentioned, and since those other vidyās-such as the texts &amp;lsquo;and those who in the forest meditate on faith and austerities,&amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; those who in the forest worship faith, the True&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. V, 10, 1; Br̥. Up. VI, 2, 15)&amp;ndash;suggest to the mind the idea of the knowledge of Brahman. This the Sūtra negatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;33&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised (in all meditations). There being equality (of the Brahman to be meditated on) and (those conceptions) existing (in Brahman); as in the case of what belongs to the upasad. This has been explained.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read in the Br̥had-āraṇyaka (III, 8, 9),&amp;lsquo;O Gārgī, the Brāhmaṇas call that the Akshara. It is neither coarse nor fine,&amp;rsquo; and so on. And in the Atharvaṇa (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5) we have &amp;lsquo;The higher knowledge is that by which the Akshara is apprehended. That which cannot be seen nor seized,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The doubt here arises whether all the qualities there predicated of Brahman&amp;ndash;called akshara, i.e. the Imperishable&amp;ndash;and constituting something contrary in nature to the apparent world, are to be included in all meditations on Brahman, or only those where the text specially mentions them. The Pūrvapakshin advocates the latter view; for, he says, there is no authority for holding that the qualities which characterise one meditation are characteristic of other meditations also; and such negative attributes as are mentioned in those two texts do not&amp;ndash;as positive qualities such as bliss do&amp;ndash;contribute to the apprehension of the true nature of Brahman. What those two texts do is merely to deny of Brahman, previously apprehended as having bliss, and so on, for its essential qualities, certain qualities belonging to the empirical world, such as grossness, and so on; for all negation must refer to an established basis.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra refutes. The ideas of absence of grossness, and so on, which are connected with Brahman viewed as the Akshara, are to be included in all meditations on Brahman. For the imperishable (akshara) Brahman is the same in all meditations, and qualities such as non-grossness enter into the conception of its essential nature. The apprehension of a thing means the apprehension of its specific character. But mere bliss, and so on, does not suggest the specific character of Brahman, since those qualities belong also to the individual soul. What is specifically characteristic of Brahman is bliss, and so on, in so far as fundamentally opposed to all evil and imperfection. The individual soul, on the other hand, although fundamentally free from evil, yet is capable of connexion with evil. Now being fundamentally opposed to evil implies having a character the opposite of grossness and all similar qualities which belong to the empirical world, material and mental. He therefore who thinks of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Other qualities, such as doing all works and the like, although indeed following their substrate, are explicitly to be meditated on in special meditations only.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the idea of the Imperishable.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;35&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said that (the former reply refers) to that Self to which the aggregate of material things belongs (since) otherwise the difference (of the two replies) could not be accounted for; we say&amp;ndash;no; as in the case of instruction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Br̥had-araṇyaka (III, 4; 5) the same question is asked twice in succession (&amp;lsquo;Tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self who is within all&amp;rsquo;), while Yājñavalkya gives a different answer to each (&amp;lsquo;He who breathes in the upbreathing,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.; &amp;lsquo;He who overcomes hunger and thirst,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.). The question here is whether the two meditations, suggested by these sections, are different or not. They are different,since the difference of reply effects a distinction between the two vidyās. The former reply declares him who is the maker of breathing forth, and so on to be the inner Self of all; the latter describes him as free from hunger, thirst, and so on. It thence appears that the former passage refers to the inner (individual) Self which is different from body, sense-organs, internal organ and vital breath; while the latter refers to that which again differs from the inner Self, viz. the highest Self, free from hunger, thirst, and so on. As the individual soul is inside the aggregate of material things, it may be spoken of as being that inner Self of all. Although this kind of inwardness is indeed only a relative one, we nevertheless must accept it in this place; for if, desirous of taking this &amp;lsquo;being the inner Self of all&amp;rsquo; in its literal sense, we assumed the highest Self to be meant, the difference of the two replies could not be accounted for. The former reply evidently refers to the individual soul, since the highest Self cannot be conceived as breathing forth, and so on; and the latter reply, which declares the Self to be raised above hunger, &amp;amp;c., evidently refers to the highest Self. This is expressed in the earlier part of the Sūtra: &amp;lsquo;The former reply refers to the Self to which there belongs the aggregate of material things, i.e. the individual soul as being the inner Self of all; otherwise we could not account for the difference of the two replies.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;The last words of the Sūtra negative this&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;not so,&amp;rsquo; i.e. there is no difference of vidyās, since both assertions and replies refer to the highest Self. The question says in both places, &amp;rsquo;the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self who is within all,&amp;rsquo; and this clearly refers to the highest Self only. We indeed observe that in some places the term &lt;em&gt;Brahman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both questions have for their topic Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all; and in the second question the word &amp;rsquo;eva&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;just,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;very&amp;rsquo;) in &amp;lsquo;Tell me just that Brahman,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., proves that the question of Kahola has for its subject the Brahman, to the qualities of which the question of Ushasta had referred. Both answers again refer to the one Brahman, viewed as the Self of all. The idea of the injunction of the entire meditation again is suggested in the second section only, &amp;lsquo;Therefore a Brahmaṇa, after he has done with learning, is to wish to stand by real strength.&amp;rsquo; The object of meditation being thus ascertained to be one, there must be effected a mutual interchange of the ideas of Ushasta and Kahola, i.e. Ushasta&amp;rsquo;s conception of Brahman being the cause of all life must be entertained by the interrogating Kahola also; and vice versa the conception of Kahola as to Brahman being beyond hunger,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is proved by the fact that the attributes&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;&lt;em&gt;that which truly is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and so on&amp;ndash;which were mentioned in the first section and confirmed in the subsequent ones, are finally summed up in the statement, &amp;lsquo;in that all this has its Self, that is the True, that is the Self.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A doubt here arises whether the two texts constitute one meditation or not.&amp;ndash;The two meditations are separate, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for they have different characters. The Cḥāndogya represents as the object of meditation the ether as distinguished by eight different attributes, viz. freedom from all evil and the rest; while, according to the Vājasaneyaka, the being to be meditated on is he who dwells within that ether, and is distinguished by attributes such as lordship, and so on.&amp;ndash;To this we reply that the meditations are not distinct, since there is no difference of character. For desires and so on constitute that character &amp;lsquo;here and there,&amp;rsquo; i.e. in both texts nothing else but Brahman distinguished by attributes, such as having true wishes, and so on, forms the subject of meditation. This is known &amp;lsquo;from the abode and so on,&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the Cḥāndogya. the passage, &amp;lsquo;Those who depart from hence, after having cognised the Self and those self-realising desires, move about at will in all those worlds,&amp;rsquo; enjoins the knowledge of Brahman as distinguished by the power of realising its desires and similar qualities, while the text, &amp;lsquo;Those who depart from here not having cognised the Self, &amp;amp;c., do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; move about at will,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., finds fault with the absence of such knowledge, and in this way emphasises the importance of the possession of it. In the same way the repeated declarations as to Brahman&amp;rsquo;s ruling power (&amp;rsquo;the lord of all, the king of all beings,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.) show that stress is to be laid upon the quality indicated. It truly cannot be held that Scripture, which in tender regard to man&amp;rsquo;s welfare is superior to a thousand of parents, should, deceitfully, give emphatic instruction as to certain qualities&amp;ndash;not known through any other means of knowledge&amp;ndash;which fundamentally would be unreal and hence utterly to be disregarded, and thus throw men desirous of release, who as it is are utterly confused by the revolutions of the wheel of Saṁsāra, into even deeper confusion and distress. That the text, &amp;rsquo;there is not any diversity here; as one only is to be seen that eternal being,&amp;rsquo; teaches a unitary view of the world in so far as everything is an effect of Brahman and thus has Brahman for its Self, and negatives the view of plurality&amp;ndash;established antecedently to Vedic teaching&amp;ndash;as excluding Brahman&amp;rsquo;s being the universal Self, we have explained&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Moreover the statement referring to these meditations, viz. &amp;lsquo;whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that becomes more vigorous,&amp;rsquo; does not allow the assumption of a special fruit for these meditations (apart from the fruit of the sacrificial performance); while in the case of the ladle being made of parṇa wood the text mentions a special fruit (&amp;lsquo;he whose ladle is made of parṇa wood does not hear an evil sound&amp;rsquo;). The meditations in question are therefore necessarily to be connected with the particular sacrificial performances to which they belong.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra refutes, &amp;lsquo;There is non-restriction with regard to the determinations.&amp;rsquo; By &amp;lsquo;determination&amp;rsquo; we have here to understand the definite settling of the mind in a certain direction, in other words, meditation. The meditations on the udgītha and so on are not definitely connected with the sacrificial performances; &amp;lsquo;since that is seen,&amp;rsquo; i.e. since the texts themselves declare that there is no such necessary connexion; cp. the text, &amp;rsquo;therefore both perform the sacrificial work, he who thus knows it&lt;/p&gt;</description>

VIII, 1 ff.) the text, &amp;rsquo;those who depart having known here the Self, and those true desires,&amp;rsquo; declares at first a meditation on the small ether, i.e. the highest Self, and separately therefrom a meditation on its qualities, viz. true desires, and so on. The doubt here arises whether, in the meditation on those qualities, the meditation on the highest Self&amp;ndash;as that to which the qualities belong&amp;ndash;is to be repeated or not.&amp;ndash;It is not to be repeated, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for the highest Self is just that which is constituted by the qualities&amp;ndash;freedom from all evil, and so on&amp;ndash;and as that Self so constituted&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This also is declared (in the Pūrva Mīmāmsā).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Taittirīyaka contains another daharavidyā, &amp;lsquo;The thousand-headed god, the all-eyed one,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Mahānār. Up. XI). Here the doubt arises whether this vidyā, as being one with the previously introduced vidyā, states qualities to be included in the meditation enjoined in that vidyā, or qualities to be included in the meditations on the highest Self as enjoined in all the Vedānta-texts.&amp;ndash;The former is the case, the Pūrvapakshin holds, on account of the leading subject-matter. For in the preceding section (X) the meditation on the small ether is introduced as the subject-matter. &amp;lsquo;There is the small lotus placed in the middle of the town (of the body), free from all evil, the abode&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;44&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is option with regard to what precedes (i.e. the altar made of bricks) on account of subject-matter, and hence there is action; as in the case of the mānasa cup.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Vājasaneyaka, in the Agnirahasya chapter, there are references to certain altars built of mind, &amp;lsquo;built of mind, built of speech,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The doubt here arises whether those structures of mind, and so on, which metaphorically are called fire-altars, should be considered as being of the nature of action, on account of their connexion with a performance which itself is of the nature of action; or merely of the nature of meditation, as being connected with an activity of the nature of meditation. The Sūtra maintains the former view. Since those things &amp;lsquo;built of mind, and so on,&amp;rsquo; are, through being &lt;em&gt;built&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;piled up&lt;/em&gt;), constituted as fire-altars, they demand a performance with which to connect themselves; and as in immediate proximity to them no performance is enjoined, and as the general subject-matter of the section is the fire-altar built of bricks&amp;ndash;introduced by means of the clause &amp;lsquo;Non-being this was in the beginning&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;which is invariably connected with a performance of the nature of outward action, viz. a certain sacrificial performance&amp;ndash;we conclude that the altars built of mind, &amp;amp;c., which the text mentions in connexion with the same subject-matter, are themselves of the nature of action, and as such can be used as alternatives for the altar built of bricks. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An analogous case is presented by the so-called &lt;em&gt;mental&lt;/em&gt; cup. On the tenth, so-called avivākya, day of the Soma sacrifice extending over twelve days,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All those altars thus having equal effects there is choice between them. The altars of mind, and so on, therefore are auxiliary members of the sacrificial performance which they help to accomplish, and hence themselves of the nature of action.&amp;ndash;Against this view the next Sūtra declares itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For this is what the text asserts, viz. in the clauses &amp;rsquo;they are built of knowledge only,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;by knowledge they are built for him who thus knows.&amp;rsquo; As the energies of mind, speech, sight, and so on, cannot be piled up like bricks, it is indeed a matter of course that the so-called altars constructed of mind, and so on, can be mental constructions only; but the text in addition specially confirms this by declaring that those altars are elements in an activity of purely intellectual character, and hence themselves mere creatures of the intellect. Moreover there is seen in the text a performance consisting of thought only to which those fires stand in a subsidiary relation, &amp;lsquo;by the mind they were established on hearths, by the mind they were built up, by the mind the Soma cups were drawn thereat;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What is meant is that the special mention of the cups, and so on, made in the passage &amp;lsquo;by the mind the Soma cups were drawn thereat,&amp;rsquo; proves the difference of the performance.&amp;ndash;The &amp;lsquo;and the rest&amp;rsquo; of the Sūtra comprises the previously stated arguments, viz. direct statement, and so on. &amp;lsquo;As other meditations,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the case is analogous to that of other meditations such as the meditation on the small ether within the heart, which are likewise proved by textual statement, and so on, to be different and separate from actual outward sacrificial performances.&amp;ndash;The existence of a separate meditative act having thus been ascertained, the requisite injunction has to be construed on the basis of the text as it stands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For it is observed that such assimilation rests sometimes on a special point of resemblance only; so in the text, &amp;lsquo;The person in yonder orb is Death indeed,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;where the feature of resemblance is the destroying power of the two; for the person within yonder orb does certainly not occupy the same worlds, i.e. the same place as Death. Analogously, in the case under discussion, the fact that the altars made of mind are treated as, in a certain respect, equivalent to the altar built of bricks, does not authorise us to connect those altars with the sacrificial performance to which the altar of bricks belongs. When the text says that the altar made of mind is as great as the altar of bricks, this only means that the same result which is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the connexion is on account of plurality.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Brāhmaṇa (Śat. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the text treating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a meditation only. For that Brāhmaṇa (which begins &amp;lsquo;This brick-built fire-altar is this world; the waters are its enclosing-stones,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.) declares further on &amp;lsquo;whosoever knows this thus comes to be that whole Agni who is the space-filler,&amp;rsquo; and from this it appears that what is enjoined there is a meditation with a special result of its own. And further on (X, 6) there is another meditation enjoined, viz. one on Vaiśvānara. All this shows that the Agnirahasya book (Śat. Br. X) is not solely concerned with the injunction of outward sacrificial acts.&amp;ndash;But what then is the reason that such matters as the mental (meditative) construction of fire-altars which ought to be included in the Br̥had-āraṇyaka are included in the Agnirahasya?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;That connexion is on account of plurality,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the altars made of mind, and so on, are, in the sacred text, dealt with in proximity to the real altar made of bricks, because so many details of the latter are mentally to be accomplished in the meditation.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;option with the previous one.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;53&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of sacrifices) are not (restricted) to (particular) śākhās, but rather (belong) to all śākhās.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are certain meditations connected with certain constituent elements of sacrifices-as e.g. &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the Udgītha &amp;lsquo;(&lt;em&gt;Kh.&lt;/em&gt; Up. I, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the five worlds&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;Kh.&lt;/em&gt; Up. II, 2, 1), &amp;amp;c. The question here arises whether those meditations are restricted to the members of those śākhās in whose texts they are mentioned; or to be connected with the Udgītha, and so on, in all śākhās. There is here a legitimate ground for doubt, in so far as, although the general agreement of all Vedānta-texts is established, the Udgītha, and so on, are different in each Veda since the accents differ in the different Vedas&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin declares that those meditations are limited each to its particular śākhā; for, he says, the injunction &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; does indeed, verbally, refer to the Udgītha in general; but as what stands nearest to this injunction is the special Udgītha of the śākhā, in whose text this injunction occurs, and which shares the peculiarities of accent characteristic of that śākhā, we decide that the meditation is enjoined on members of that śākhā only.&amp;ndash;The Sūtra sets this opinion aside. The injunction of meditations of this type is valid for all śākhās, since the text expressly connects them with the Udgītha in general. They therefore hold good wherever there is an Udgītha. The individual Udgīthas of the several śākhās are indeed distinguished by different accentuation; but the general statement, &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha.&amp;rsquo; suggests to the mind not any particular Udgītha, but &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Udgītha in general, and hence there is no reason to restrict the meditation to a particular śākhā. From the principle moreover that all śākhās teach the same doctrine, it follows that the sacrifice enjoined in the different śākhās is one only; and hence there is no reason to hold that the Udgītha suggested by the injunction of the meditation is a particular one. For the Udgītha is only an element in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is one and the same. The meditations are not therefore limited to particular śākhās.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. V, 12 ff.) enjoins a meditation on Vaiśvānara, the object of which is the highest Self, as having for its body the entire threefold world, and for its limbs the heavenly world, the sun, the wind, and so on. The doubt here arises whether separate meditations have to be performed on the highest Being in its separate aspects, or in its aggregate as well as in its distributed aspect, or in its aggregate aspect only.&amp;ndash;In its separate aspects, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; since at the outset a meditation of that kind is declared. For on the R̥shis in succession telling Aśvapati the objects of their meditation, viz. the sky, the sun, and so on, Aśvapati explains to them that these meditations refer to the head, eye, and so on, of the highest Being, and mentions for each of these meditations a special fruit. And the concluding explanation &amp;lsquo;he who worships Vaiśvānara as a span long, &amp;amp;c.,&amp;rsquo; is merely meant to gather up into one, as it were, the preceding meditations on the parts of Vaiśvānara.&amp;ndash;Another Pūrvapakshin holds that this very concluding passage enjoins a further meditation on Vaiśvānara in his collective aspect, in addition to the previously enjoined meditations&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To a different category belong those meditations which have a special object such as Prāṇa, and a special result.&amp;ndash;The doubt here arises whether the meditations of the former class are all to be considered as identical, or as separate&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds that they are all one; for, he says, they all have one and the same object of meditation, viz. Brahman. For the nature of all cognition depends on the object cognised; and the nature of the meditations thus being one, the meditations themselves are one.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra controverts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;57&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Option, on account of the non-difference of result.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been proved that the meditation on that which truly is, the meditation on the small ether within the heart, and so on&amp;ndash;all of which have for their result the attainment to Brahman&amp;ndash;are separate meditations. The question now arises whether all these meditations should be combined by each meditating devotee, on account of such combination being useful to him; or whether, in the absence of any use of such combination, they should be&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;59&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They belong to the constituent members, as the bases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A doubt arises whether meditations such as the one enjoined in the text, &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgītha,&amp;rsquo; which are connected with constituent elements of the sacrifice such as the Udgītha, contribute towards the accomplishment of the sacrifice, and hence must be performed at the sacrifice as part of it; or whether they, like the godohana vessel, benefit the agent apart from the sacrifice, and therefore may be undertaken according to desire.&amp;ndash;But has it not been already decided under III, 3, 42 that those meditations are generally beneficial to man, and not therefore restricted to the sacrifices?&amp;ndash;True; it is just for the purpose of further confirming that conclusion that objections are now raised against it on the ground of some inferential marks (linga) and reasoning. For there it was maintained on the strength of the text &amp;rsquo;therefore he does both&amp;rsquo; that those meditations have results independent of the sacrifice. But there are several reasons favouring the view that those meditations must be connected with the sacrifices as subordinate members, just as the Udgītha and the rest to which the meditations refer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;60&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of injunction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above conclusion is further confirmed by the fact of injunction, i.e. thereby that clauses such as &amp;lsquo;he is to meditate on the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; enjoin the meditation as standing to the Udgītha in the relation of a subordinate member. Injunctions of this kind differ from injunctions such as &amp;lsquo;he is to bring water in the godohana vessel for him who desires cattle&amp;rsquo;; for the latter state a special qualification on the part of him who performs the action, while the former do not, and hence cannot claim independence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;61&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of rectification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text &amp;lsquo;from the seat of the Hotr̥ he sets right the wrong Udgīha&amp;rsquo; shows that the meditation is necessarily required for the purpose of correcting whatever mistake may be made in the Udgītha. This also proves that the meditation is an integral part of the sacrificial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;62&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the declaration of a quality being common (to all the Vedas).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text &amp;lsquo;By means of that syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Oṁ the Adhvaryu gives orders,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;with Oṁ the Hotr̥ recites, with Oṁ the Udgātr̥ sings,&amp;rsquo; which declares the praṇava&amp;ndash;which is a &amp;lsquo;quality&amp;rsquo; of the meditation, in so far as it is its basis&amp;ndash;to be common to the three Vedas, further shows that the meditation has to be employed in connexion with the sacrifice. For the meditation is connected with the Udgītha, and the Udgitha is an integral part of all sacrificial performances whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;63&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rather not, as the text does not declare their going together.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not true that the meditations on the Udgītha and the rest are bound to the sacrifices in the same way as the Udgītha, and so on, themselves are; for Scripture does not declare that they go together with, i.e. are subordinate constituents of the Udgītha, and so on. The clause &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; does not indeed itself state another qualification on the part of the agent (i.e. does not state that the agent in entering on the meditation is prompted by a motive other than the one prompting the sacrifice); but the subsequent clause, &amp;rsquo; whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that becomes more vigorous,&amp;rsquo; intimates that knowledge is the means to render the sacrificial work more efficacious, and from this it follows that the meditation is enjoined as a means towards effecting a result other than the result of the sacrifice. And hence the meditation cannot be viewed as a subordinate member of the Udgītha, which itself is a subordinate member of the sacrifice. It rather has the Udgītha for its basis only. He only indeed who is qualified for the sacrifice is qualified for the meditation, since the latter aims at greater efficaciousness of the sacrifice; but this does not imply that the meditation necessarily goes with the sacrifice. By the greater vigour of the sacrifice is meant its non-obstruction by some other sacrificial work of greater strength, its producing its effect without any delay.&amp;ndash;The case of a statement such as &amp;lsquo;he whose ladle is of parṇa wood hears no evil sound&amp;rsquo; is different. There the text does not declare that the quality&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;64&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And because (Scripture) shows it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A scriptural text, moreover, shows that the meditation is necessary for, and restricted to, the sacrificial performance. For the text &amp;lsquo;A Brahman priest who knows this saves the sacrifice, the sacrificcr, and all the officiating priests&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which declares that all priests are saved through the knowledge of the Brahman&amp;ndash;has sense only on the understanding that that knowledge is not restricted to the Udjātr̥, and so on (i.e. not to those priests who are engaged in carrying out the details of the sacrifices which are the &amp;lsquo;bases&amp;rsquo; of the meditations).&amp;ndash;The conclusion, therefore, is that those meditations are not restricted to the sacrifices, subordinate members of which serve as their &amp;lsquo;bases.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;This terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;like the bases.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
