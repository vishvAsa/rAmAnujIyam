40. In the case of him who has approached (Brahman); just on that account, this being declared by the text.

When the soul, released from all bonds and manifesting itself in its true nature, has approached, i.e. attained to Brahman; then just on that account, i.e. on account of such approach, the text declares it to possess the power of moving about at will in all worlds. 'Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his true form.

 He is the highest Person. He moves about there laughing, playing,' &c. This point will be proved in greater detail in the fourth adhyāya. Meanwhile the conclusion is that such qualities as satyakāmatva have to be included in the meditation of him also who is desirous of release; for the possession of those qualities forms part of the experience of the released soul itself.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'wishes and the rest'
