10. (It is) non-comprehensive.

The scriptural declaration does not refer to all meditations, but only to the meditation on the Udgītha. In the clause 'what he does with knowledge,' the 'what' is in itself indefinite, and therefore must be defined as connecting itself with the Udgītha mentioned in the previous clause, 'Let him meditate on the Udgītha.' The sentence cannot be construed to mean 'whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,' but means 'that which he does with knowledge becomes more vigorous,' and _that which is_ done with knowledge that is the Udgītha. The next Sūtra refutes the argument set forth in Sūtra 5.
