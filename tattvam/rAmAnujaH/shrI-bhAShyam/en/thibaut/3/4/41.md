41. Nor the (expiatory performance) described in the chapter treating of qualification; that being impossible on account of the Smr̥ti referring to such lapse.

Those expiatory performances which are described in the chapter treating of qualification (Pū. Mī. Sū. VI) are not possible in the case of him who has lapsed from the condition of a Naishṭḥika; since such expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Smr̥ti text referring to such lapse, viz. 'He who having once entered on the duties of a Naishṭḥika lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not see any expiatory work by which he might become clean.' The expiatory ceremony referred to in the Pūrva Mimāṁsā therefore applies to the case of other Brahmacārins only.
