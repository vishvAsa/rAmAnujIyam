32. The works of the āśramas also, on account of their being enjoined.

It has been said that sacrifices and other works are auxiliary to the knowledge of Brahman. The doubt now arises whether those works are to be performed by him also who merely wishes to fulfil the duties of his āśrama, without aiming at final Release, or not. They are not, the Pūrvapakshin holds, for that things auxiliary to knowledge should stand in subordinate relation to a certain state of life would imply the contradiction of permanent and non-permanent obligation.--Of this view the Sūtra disposes, 'The works of the āśramas also.' The works belonging to each āśrama have to be performed by those also who do not aim at more than to live according to the āśrama; for they are specifically enjoined by texts such as as long as life lasts he is to offer the Agnihotra'; this implies a permanent obligation dependent on life. And that the same works are also to be performed as being auxiliary to

knowledge appears from the texts enjoining them in that aspect, 'Him they seek to know by the study of the Veda' (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22); this the next Sūtra declares.
