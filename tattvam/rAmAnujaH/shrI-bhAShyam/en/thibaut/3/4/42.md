42. A minor one, thus some; (and hence they hold) the existence (of expiation), as in the case of eating. This has been explained.

Some teachers are of opinion that even on the part of Naishṭḥikas and the rest the lapse from chastity constitutes only a minor offence which can be atoned for by expiatory observances; in the same way as in the case of the eating of forbidden food the same prāyaścitta may be used by the ordinary Brahmacārin and by Naishṭḥikas and the rest. This has been stated by the Smr̥ti writer, 'For the others also (i.e. the Naishṭḥikas and so on) the same (rules and

practices as those for the Upakurvāna) hold good, in so far as not opposed to their āśrama.'
