30. This is said in Smr̥ti also.

That for those as well who know Brahman, as for others, the eating of food of any kind is lawful only in case of extreme need, Smr̥ti also declares, 'He who being in danger of his life eats food from anywhere is stained by sin no more than the lotus leaf by water.'
