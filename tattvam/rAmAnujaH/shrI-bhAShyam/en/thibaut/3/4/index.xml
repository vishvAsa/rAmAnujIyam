      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fourth-pāda&#34;&gt;FOURTH PĀDA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The benefit to man results from thence, on account of scriptural statement; thus Bādarāyaṇa thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have concluded the investigation into the oneness or diverseness of meditations&amp;ndash;the result of which is to indicate in which cases the special points mentioned in several meditations have to be combined, and in which not. A further point now to be investigated is whether that advantage to the meditating devotee, which is held to accrue to him from the meditation, results from the meditation directly, or from works of which the meditations are subordinate members.&amp;ndash;The Reverend Bādarāyaṇa holds the former view. The benefit to man results from thence, i.e. from the meditation, because Scripture declares this to be so. &amp;lsquo;He who knows Brahman reaches the Highest&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;I know that great Person of sun-like lustre beyond the darkness. A man who knows him truly passes over death; there is no other path to go&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. III, 8); &amp;lsquo;As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and their form, thus a man who possesses knowledge, freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person who is greater than the great&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8).&amp;ndash;Against this view the Pūrvapakshin raises an objection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of (the Self) standing in a complementary relation, they are arthavādas, as in other cases; thus Jaimini opines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has been said as to Scripture intimating that a beneficial result is realised through the meditations by themselves is untenable. For texts such as &amp;lsquo;he who knows Brahman reaches the Highest&amp;rsquo; do not teach that the highest aim of man is attained through knowledge; their purport rather is to inculcate knowledge of Truth on the part of a Self which is the agent in works prescribed. Knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of (such) conduct being seen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied themselves chiefly with sacrifices.&amp;ndash;Aśvapati Kaikeya had a deep knowledge of the Self; but when three R̥shis had come to him to receive instruction regarding the Self, he told them &amp;lsquo;I am about, to perform a sacrifice, Sirs&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Smr̥ti that Janaka and other princes deeply versed in the knowledge of Brahman applied themselves to sacrificial works, &amp;lsquo;By works only Janaka and others attained to perfection&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He also, well founded in knowledge, offered many sacrifices.&amp;rsquo; And this fact&amp;ndash;that those who know Brahman apply themselves to works chiefly&amp;ndash;shows that knowledge (or meditation) has no independent value, but serves to set forth the true nature of the active Self, and thus is subordinate to work.&amp;ndash;An even more direct proof is set forth in the next Sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nor can it be said that this text refers, on the ground of leading subject-matter (prakaraṇa), to the Udgītha only; for direct scriptural statement (śuti) is stronger than subject-matter,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and the words &amp;lsquo;whatever he does with knowledge&amp;rsquo; clearly refer to knowledge in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. IV, 4, 2) shows that knowledge and work go together, and this going together is possible only if, in the manner stated, knowledge is subordinate to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of injunction for such a one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge is subordinate to works follows therefrom also that works are enjoined on him only who possesses knowledge. For texts such as &amp;lsquo;He who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 15), enjoin works on him only who has mastered the sacred texts so as fully to understand their meaning&amp;ndash;for this is the sense of the term &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; (adhyayana). Hence the knowledge of Brahman also is enjoined ith a view to works only: it has no independent result of its own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Is. Up. II), expressly enjoins lifelong works on him who knows the Self. The general conclusion, therefore, is that knowledge (meditation) is merely auxiliary to works. Of this view the next Sūtra finally disposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Let the inferential marks (referred to by the Pūrvapakshin) be; the direct teaching of the texts certainly refers to a being different from the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the declarations are equal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The argument that knowledge must be held subordinate to work because we learn from Scripture that those who know Brahman perform sacrificial works, will not hold good; since, on the other hand, we also see that men knowing Brahman abandoned all work; cp. texts such as &amp;lsquo;The R̥shis descended from Kavasha said: For what purpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should we sacrifice?&amp;rsquo; As it thus appears that those who know Brahman give up works, knowledge cannot be a mere auxiliary to works.&amp;ndash;But how can it be accounted for that those who know Brahman both do and do not perform works?&amp;ndash;Works may be performed in so far as sacrifices and the like, if performed by one not having any special wish, stand in subordinate relation to the knowledge of Brahman; hence there is no objection to texts enjoining works. And as, on the other hand, sacrifices and such-like works when aiming at results of their own are opposed to the knowledge of Brahman which has Release for its only result, there is all the less objection to texts which suggest the non-performance of works. If, on the other hand, knowledge were subordinate to works, works could on no account be dispensed with.&amp;ndash;Against the assertion that&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the clause &amp;lsquo;what he does with knowledge,&amp;rsquo; the &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo; is in itself indefinite, and therefore must be defined as connecting itself with the Udgītha mentioned in the previous clause, &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha.&amp;rsquo; The sentence cannot be construed to mean &amp;lsquo;whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,&amp;rsquo; but means &amp;rsquo;that which he does with knowledge becomes more vigorous,&amp;rsquo; and &lt;em&gt;that which is&lt;/em&gt; done with knowledge that is the Udgītha. The next Sūtra refutes the argument set forth in Sūtra 5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the text which refers to the man &amp;lsquo;who has read the Veda&amp;rsquo; enjoins works on him who has merely &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the texts, and &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; there means nothing more than the apprehension of the aggregate of syllables called Veda, without any insight into their meaning. A man who has thus mastered the words of the Veda apprehends therefrom that it makes statements as to works having certain results, and then on his own account&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For there is no special reason to hold that that text refers to works as independent means of a desirable result: it may as well be understood to refer to works merely subordinate to knowledge. As he who knows the Self has to practise meditation as long as he lives, he may also have to practise, for the same period, works that are helpful to meditation. Having thus refuted the objection on the ground of the reason of the matter, the Sūtrakāra proceeds to give his own interpretation of the text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. V, 4, 22.) This text also proves knowledge not to be subsidiary to works; for if it were so subsidiary, it would not be possible for him who knows Brahman to give up householdership (with all the works obligatory on that state) according to his liking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For this reason also knowledge cannot be subsidiary to works.&amp;ndash;But, it may be objected, there is no such condition of life; for texts such as &amp;lsquo;he is to perform the Agnihotra as long as he lives,&amp;rsquo; declare men to be obliged to perform sacrifices and the like up to the end of their lives, and Smr̥ti texts contradicting Scripture have no authority.&amp;ndash;To meet this the Sūtra adds &amp;lsquo;for in Scripture.&amp;rsquo; The three stages of life are recognised in Scripture only; cp. texts such as &amp;lsquo;Those who in the forest practise penance and faith&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.

For none of those texts contain injunctive forms. The text &amp;lsquo;There are three branches of sacred observance,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. II, 23, 1), is meant to glorify the previous meditation on Brahman under the form of the pra«ava, as appears from the concluding clause &amp;lsquo;he who is firmly grounded in Brahman obtains immortality&amp;rsquo;; it therefore cannot mean to enjoin the three conditions of life as valid states. In the same way the text &amp;lsquo;And those who in the forest practise penance and faith&amp;rsquo; refers to the statements previously made as to the path of the gods, and cannot therefore be meant to make an original declaration as to another condition of life. Scripture moreover expressly forbids that other condition, &amp;lsquo;a murderer of men is he who removes the fire,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. There are therefore no conditions of life in which men are bound to observe chastity. This is the opinion of the teacher Jaimini.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The reference there made to the condition of the householder necessarily presupposes that condition to be already established and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No account being taken of the text of the Jābālas, &amp;lsquo;Having completed his studentship he is to become a householder,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., it is thus a settled conclusion that the texts discussed, although primarily concerned with other topics, must at the same time be viewed as proving the validity of the several conditions of life. From this it follows that the text enjoining the performance of the Agnihotra up to the end of life, and similar texts, are not universally binding, but concern those only who do not retire from worldly life.&amp;ndash;The final conclusion therefore is that as the knowledge of Brahman is enjoined on those who lead a life of austerity (which does not require the performance of sacrifices and the like), it is not subordinate to works, but is in itself beneficial to man.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;benefit to man.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Are texts such as &amp;lsquo;That Udgītha is the best of all essences, the highest, holding the supreme place, the eighth&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. I, 1, 3) meant to glorify the Udgītha as a constituent element of the sacrifice, or to enjoin a meditation on the Udgītha as the best of all essences, and so on? The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view, on the ground that the text declares the Udgītha to be the best of all essences in so far as being a constituent element of the sacrifice. The case is analogous to that of texts such as &amp;rsquo;the ladle is this earth, the āhavanīya is the heavenly world,&amp;rsquo; which are merely meant to glorify the ladle and the rest as constituent members of the sacrifice.&amp;ndash;This view the latter part of the Sūtra sets aside &amp;lsquo;on account of newness.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The above Sūtra declares that as persons of that class are referred to by Scripture as specially concerned with meditation (&amp;lsquo;He who is founded on Brahman reaches immortality;&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;those who in the forest,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.), their meditation does not presuppose a knowledge of the kindling of fire and so on, i.e. a knowledge of the Agnihotra, the Darśapūrṇamāsa, and all those other sacrifices which require the preliminary establishnlent of the sacred fires, but a knowledge of those works only which are enjoined for their special condition of life.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the kindling of the fire.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. IV, 4, 22), does not prove sacrifices and so on to be auxiliary to knowledge, since the stress there lies (not on the sacrifices and so on, but) on the desire of knowledge.&amp;ndash;Of this view the Sūtra disposes. In the case of householders, for whom the Agnihotra and so on are obligatory, knowledge presupposes all those works, since scriptural texts such as the one quoted directly state that sacrifices and the like are auxiliary to knowledge. &amp;lsquo;They seek to know by means of sacrifices&amp;rsquo; can be said only if sacrifices are understood to be a means through which knowledge is brought about; just as one can say &amp;lsquo;he desires to slay with a sword,&amp;rsquo; because the sword is admitted to be an instrument wherewith one can kill. What we have to understand by knowledge in this connexion has been repeatedly explained, viz. a mental energy different in character from the mere cognition of the sense of texts, and more specifically denoted by such terms as dhyāna or upāsana, i.e. meditation; which is of the nature of remembrance (i.e. representative thought), but in intuitive clearness is not inferior to the clearest presentative thought (pratyaksha); which by constant daily practice becomes ever more perfect, and being duly continued up to death secures final Release. Such meditation is originated in the mind through the grace of the Supreme Person, who is pleased and conciliated by the different kinds of acts of sacrifice and worship duly performed by the Devotee day after day. This is what the text &amp;rsquo;they seek to know through the sacrifice&amp;rsquo; really means. The conclusion therefore is that in the case of householders knowledge has for its pre-requisite all sacrifices and other works of permanent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pūrvapakshin says he must not, since the performance of works implies the activity of the outer and inner organs of action, and since calmness and so on are of an exactly opposite nature.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside. The householder also, although engaged in outward activity, must, in so far as he possesses knowledge, practise calmness of mind and the rest also; for these qualities or states are by Scripture enjoined as auxiliaries to knowledge, &amp;lsquo;Therefore he who knows this, having become calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected, should see the Self in Self (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 23). As calmness of mind and the rest are seen, in so far as implying composure and concentration of mind, to promote the origination of knowledge, they also must necessarily be aimed at and practised. Nor can it be said that between works on the one side and calmness and so on on the other, there is an absolute antagonism; for the two have different spheres of application. Activity of the organs of action is the proper thing in the case of works enjoined; quiescence in the case of works not enjoined and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 1, 14; and so on). A doubt here arises whether this permission of all food is valid for him who possesses the knowledge of prāṇa, in all circumstances, or only in the case of life being in danger.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view, on account of no special conditions being stated in the text.&amp;ndash;This the Sūtra sets aside &amp;lsquo;in the case of danger to life&amp;rsquo;; for the reason that, as the text shows, the eating of food of all kinds is permitted even for those who know Brahman itself&amp;ndash;the knowledge of which of course is higher than that of prāṇa&amp;ndash;only when their life is in danger. The text alluded to is the one telling how Ushasta Cākrāyaṇa, who was well versed in the knowledge of Brahman, once, when in great distress, ate unlawful food. We therefore conclude that what the text says as to all food being lawful for him who knows prāṇa, can refer only to occasions when food of any kind must be eaten in order to preserve life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A doubt now arises whether those men also who, on account of poverty and so on, stand outside the āśramas are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman, or rtot.&amp;ndash;They are not, the Pūrvapakshin holds, since such knowledge is to be attained in a way dependent on the special duties of each āśrama; while those who do not belong to an āśrama are not concerned with āśrama duties.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra rejects. Those also who do not stand within any āśrama are qualified for knowledge, &amp;lsquo;because that is seen,&amp;rsquo; i.e. because the texts declare that men such as Raikva, Bhīshma, Saṁvarta and others who did not belong to āśrama were well grounded in the knowledge of Brahman. It can by no means be maintained that it is āśrama duties only that promote knowledge; for the text &amp;lsquo;by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and so on&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 22) distinctly declares that charity also and other practices, which are not confined to the āśramas, are helpful towards knowledge. In the same way as in the case of those bound to chastity&amp;ndash;who, as the texts show, may possess the knowledge of Brahman&amp;ndash;knowledge is promoted by practices other than the Agnihotra and the like, so&amp;ndash;it is concluded&amp;ndash;in the case of those also who do not belong to any abrama knowledge may be promoted by certain practices not exclusively connected with any āśrama, such as prayer, fasting, charity, propitiation of the divinity, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

May he perform other works or not, one who befriends all creatures is called a Brāhmaṇa&amp;rsquo; (Manu Smr̥. II, 17).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. I, 10).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The latter state may be due to misfortune; but he who can should be within an āśrama, which state is the more holy and beneficial one. This follows from inference only, i.e. Smr̥ti; for Smr̥ti says, &amp;lsquo;A Brāhmaṇa is to remain outside the āśramas not even for one day.&amp;rsquo; For one who has passed beyond the stage of Brahmacarya, or whose wife has died, the impossibility to procure a wife constitutes the misfortune (which prevents him from belonging to an āśrama).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;widowers.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mī. Sū. VI) are not possible in the case of him who has lapsed from the condition of a Naishṭḥika; since such expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Smr̥ti text referring to such lapse, viz. &amp;lsquo;He who having once entered on the duties of a Naishṭḥika lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not see any expiatory work by which he might become clean.&amp;rsquo; The expiatory ceremony referred to in the Pūrva Mimāṁsā therefore applies to the case of other Brahmacārins only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For Smr̥ti, i.e. the text quoted above, &amp;lsquo;I see no expiatory performance by which he, a slayer of Brahman as he is, could become pure again,&amp;rsquo; declares that expiations are powerless to restore purity. And custom confirms the same conclusion; for good men shun those Naishṭḥikas who have lapsed, even after they have performed prāyascittas, and do not impart to them the knowledge of Brahman, The conclusion, therefore, is that such men are not qualified for knowing Brahman.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;him who has become that.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Injunctions referring to the performance of the sacrifices such as &amp;lsquo;he chooses the priests; he gives to the priests their fee&amp;rsquo; indicate that the entire sacrificial performance is the work of the priests, and that hence all activities comprised within it&amp;ndash;mental as well as bodily&amp;ndash;belong to the priests. Capability or non-capability does not constitute the criterion in this case. For although the meditations in question aim directly at the benefit of man (not at the greater perfection of the sacrifice), yet since they fall within the sphere of qualification of those who are qualified for the sacrifice, and since the sacrifice with all its subordinate elements has to be performed by the priests, and since the text &amp;lsquo;whatever he does with knowledge that becomes more vigorous &amp;rsquo; declares knowledge to belong to the same agent as the works which are benefited by such knowledge, we conclude that those meditations also are the exclusive duty of the priests. In the case of the meditations on the small ether, &amp;amp;c., on the other hand, the text says nothing as to their having to be performed by priests, and we therefore assume in accordance with the general principle that &amp;rsquo;the fruit belongs to the performer,&amp;rsquo; that the agent there is the person to whom Scripture assigns the fruit.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the lord (of the sacrifice).&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 5). A doubt arises whether this text enjoins Muni-hood in the same way as it enjoins learning and the childlike state, or merely refers to it as something already established.&amp;ndash;The Purvapakshin holds the latter view on the ground that as &amp;lsquo;Muni-hood&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; both connote knowledge, the word &amp;lsquo;Muni&amp;rsquo; merely refers back to the knowledge already enjoined in the phrase &amp;lsquo;after he has done with learning.&amp;rsquo; For the text presents no word of injunctive force with regard to Muni-hood.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra controverts. &amp;lsquo;For him who is such,&amp;rsquo; i.e. for those who possess knowledge, &amp;rsquo;there is an injunction of a different co-operative factor &amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;in the same way as injunctions and the rest.&amp;rsquo; By the &lt;em&gt;injunctions&lt;/em&gt; in the last clause we have to understand the special duties of the different āśramas, i.e. sacrifices and the like, and also such qualifications as quietness of mind and the like; and by the &amp;lsquo;and the rest&amp;rsquo; is meant the learning of and pondering on the sacred texts. Stated at length, the meaning of the Sūtra then is as follows&amp;ndash;in the same way as texts such as &amp;lsquo;him Brāhmaṇas seek to know through the reciting of the Veda, through sacrifices and charity, and so on,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Quiet, subdued,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 23) enjoin sacrifices and so on, and quietness of mind and the like, as helpful towards knowledge; and as texts such as &amp;rsquo;the Self is to be heard, to be pondered upon&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. II, 4, 5) mention hearing and pondering as helpful towards knowledge; thus the text under discussion enjoins learning, a childlike state of mind, and Muni-hood as three further different auxiliaries of knowledge.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Muni-hood&amp;rsquo; does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; denote the same thing as &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;this the Sūtra intimates by the clause &amp;lsquo;alternatively a third,&amp;rsquo; i.e. as the word muni is observed alternatively to denote persons such as Vyāsa distinguished by their power of profound reflection (manana), the abstract term munihood denotes a third thing different from &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; and the &amp;lsquo;childlike state.&amp;rsquo; Hence, although the phrase &amp;rsquo;then a Muni&amp;rsquo; does not contain a word of directly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This winding up therefore is meant to illustrate the duties (not of the householder only, but) of the members of all āśramas. Analogously in the text under discussion (Br̥. Up. III, 5) the clause &amp;lsquo;A Brāhmaṇa having risen above the desire for sons, the desire for wealth, and the desire for worlds, wanders about as a mendicant,&amp;rsquo; intimates duties belonging exclusively to the condition of the wandering beggar, and then the subsequent clause &amp;rsquo;therefore let a Brāhmaṇa having done with learning,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., enjoins pāṇḍitya, bālya, and mauna (not as incumbent on the pārivrājaka only, but) as illustrating the duties of all āśramas.&amp;ndash;This the next Sūtra explicitly declares.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With regard to the latter meaning, however, a doubt arises, viz. whether the text means to say that he who aims at perfect knowledge is to assume all the ways of a child, as e.g. its wilful behaviour, or only its freedom from pride and the like.&amp;ndash;The former, the Pūrvapakshin maintains. For the text gives no specification, and texts enjoining restraints of different kinds (on the man desirous of knowledge) are sublated by this specific text which enjoins him to be in all points like a child.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra disposes of. &amp;lsquo;Not manifesting itself.&amp;rsquo; That aspect of a child&amp;rsquo;s nature which consists in the child not manifesting its nature (viz. in pride, arrogance, and so on), the man aiming at true knowledge is to make his own. &amp;lsquo;On account of connexion,&amp;rsquo; i.e. because thus only the &amp;lsquo;balya&amp;rsquo; of the text gives a possible sense. The other characteristic features of &amp;lsquo;childhood&amp;rsquo; the texts declare to be opposed to knowledge, &amp;lsquo;He who has not turned away from wicked conduct, who is not tranquil and attentive, or whose mind is not at peace, he can never attain the Self by knowledge&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. I, 2, 24); &amp;lsquo;When food is pure, the whole nature becomes pure&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.

With regard to the former the question arises whether it springs up only immediately subsequent to the good works which are the means to bring it about; or, indefinitely, either subsequent to such works or at some later time.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view. A man reaches knowledge through his good deeds only, as the Lord himself declares, &amp;lsquo;Four kinds of men doing good works worship me,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.(Bha. Gī. VII, 16); and when those works have been accomplished there is no reason why the result, i.e. knowledge, should be delayed.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra disposes of. &amp;lsquo;What is comprised in this world,&amp;rsquo; i.e. meditation, the result of which is worldly exaltation, springs up immediately after the works to which it is due, in case of there being no other works of greater strength obstructing the rise of knowledge; but if there is an obstruction of the latter kind, knowledge springs up later on only. &amp;lsquo;For this is seen,&amp;rsquo; i.e. Scripture acknowledges the effects of such obstruction; for a statement such as &amp;rsquo; what he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad that is more vigorous,&amp;rsquo; means that works joined with the knowledge of the Udgītha, and so on, produce their results without obstruction (which implies that the action of other works is liable to be obstructed).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;what belongs to this world.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
