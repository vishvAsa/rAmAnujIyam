14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification.

The or has assertive force. The introductory words of the Upanishad, 'Hidden in the Lord is all this,' show knowledge to be the subject-matter; hence the permission of works can aim only at the glorification of knowledge. The sense of the text therefore is--owing to the power of

knowledge a man although constantly performing works is not stained by them.
