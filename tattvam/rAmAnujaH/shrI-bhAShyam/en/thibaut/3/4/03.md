3. On account of (such) conduct being seen.

It is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied themselves chiefly with sacrifices.--Aśvapati Kaikeya had a deep knowledge of the Self; but when three R̥shis had come to him to receive instruction regarding the Self, he told them 'I am about, to perform a sacrifice, Sirs' (Cḥ. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Smr̥ti that Janaka and other princes deeply versed in the knowledge of Brahman applied themselves to sacrificial works, 'By works only Janaka and others attained to perfection'; 'He also, well founded in knowledge, offered many sacrifices.' And this fact--that those who know Brahman apply themselves to works chiefly--shows that knowledge (or meditation) has no independent value, but serves to set forth the true nature of the active Self, and thus is subordinate to work.--An even more direct proof is set forth in the next Sūtra.
