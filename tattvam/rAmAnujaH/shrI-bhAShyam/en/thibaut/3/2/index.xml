      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The absence of that takes place in the nāḍīs and in the Self, according to scriptural statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next the state of deep dreamless sleep is enquired into. Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;When a man is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, so that he sees no dream, then he lies asleep in those nāḍīs&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 3); &amp;lsquo;When he is in profound sleep and is conscious of nothing, there are seventy-two thousand veins called hita which from the heart spread through the pericardium. Through them he moves forth and rests in the pericardium&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. II, 1, 19). &amp;lsquo;When a man sleeps here, he becomes united with the True&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 8, 1). These texts declare the veins, the pericardium, and Brahman to be the place of deep sleep; and hence there is a doubt whether each of them in turns, or all of them together, are that place. There is an option between them, since they are not in mutual dependence, and since the sleeping soul cannot at the same time be in several places!&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies&amp;ndash;the absence of dreams, i.e. deep sleep takes place in the veins, in the pericardium, and in the highest Self together; since these three are declared by Scripture. When different alternatives may be combined, on the ground of there being&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, io, 2), and other texts.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the absence of that.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is next remembrance&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;I, the waking person, am the same as I who was asleep.&amp;rsquo; Scripture also declares this: &amp;lsquo;Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion, or tiger, or wolf, &amp;amp;c., that they become again&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, io, 2). And, lastly, the injunctions which enjoin certain acts for the sake of final Release would be purportless if the person merged in deep sleep attained Release. Nor can it be said that the sleeping soul is free from all limiting adjuncts and manifests itself in its true nature (so as not to be different from the released soul). For with regard to the sleeping&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the swooning person there is half-combination; this being the remaining (hypothesis).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regard to a person lying in a swoon or stunned, the question arises whether that state of swoon is one of the other states, viz. deep sleep and so on, or whether it is a special condition of its own.&amp;ndash;The former alternative must be accepted. For the term &amp;lsquo;swoon&amp;rsquo; may be explained as denoting either deep sleep or some other acknowledged state, and there is no authority for assuming an altogether different new state.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside. The condition of a swooning person consists in reaching half, viz. of what leads to death; for this is the only hypothesis remaining. A swoon cannot be either dreaming or being awake; for in a swoon there is no consciousness. And as it is different in character as well as in the occasions giving rise to it from deep sleep and death, it cannot be either of those two states; for there are special circumstances occasioning a swoon, such as a blow on the head. The only possible alternative then is to view a swoon as a state in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;26&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its coils.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been shown in the preceding adhikaraṇa that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the entire non-sentient universe is the outward form of Brahman. For the purpose of proving Brahman&amp;rsquo;s freedom from all imperfection, an enquiry is now begun into the particular mode in which the world may be conceived to constitute the form of Brahman. Is the relation of the two like that of the snake and its coils; or like that of light and the luminous body, both of which fall under the same genus; or like that of the individual soul and Brahman, the soul being a distinguishing attribute and for that reason a part (aṁśa) of Brahman?&amp;ndash;On the assumption of this last alternative, which is about to be established here, it has been already shown under two preceding Sūtras (I, 4, 23; II, 1, 14), that from Brahman, as distinguished by sentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle form, there originates Brahman as distinguished by all those beings in their gross form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If Brahman itself only appeared in the form of non-sentient things&amp;ndash;as the snake itself only constitutes the coils&amp;ndash;both sets of texts, those which declare difference as well as those which declare the unchangeableness of Brahman, would be contrary to sense. We therefore, adopting the second alternative, hold that the case under discussion is analogous to that of light and that in which it abides, i.e. the luminous body. The two are different, but at the same time they are&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;28&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or else in the manner stated above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; sets aside the two preceding alternatives. One substance may indeed connect itself with several states, but the former of the two alternatives implies that Brahman itself constitutes the essential nature of non-sentient matter, and thus there is no escape from the objections already stated under Sūtra 27. Let then the second alternative be adopted according to which Brahma-hood (brahmatva) constitutes a genus inhering in Brahman as well as in non-sentient matter, just as fire constitutes the common genus for light and luminous bodies. But on this view Brahman becomes a mere abstract generic character inhering in the Lord (isvara), sentient souls and non-sentient matter, just as the generic character of horses (aśvatva) inheres in concrete individual horses; and this contradicts all the teaching of Śruti and Smr̥ti (according to which Brahman is the highest concrete entity). We therefore hold that non-sentient matter stands to Brahman in the same relation as the one previously proved for the individual soul in Sūtra II, 3, 43; 46; viz. that it is an attribute incapable of being realised apart from Brahman and hence is a part (aṁśa) of the latter. The texts referring to the two as non-different may thus be taken in their primary sense; for the part is only a limited place of that of which it is a part. And the texts referring to the two as different may also be taken in their primary sense; for the distinguishing attribute and that to which the attribute belongs are essentially different. Thus Brahman&amp;rsquo;s freedom from all imperfection is preserved.&amp;ndash;Lustre is an attribute not to be realised apart from the gem, and therefore is a part of the gem; the same relation also holds good between generic character and individuals having that character, between qualities and things having qualities, between bodies and souls. In the same way souls as well as non-sentient matter stand to Brahman in the relation of parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of denial.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Texts such as &amp;lsquo;This is that great unborn Self, undecaying, undying&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 25), &amp;lsquo;By the old age of the body that does not age&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5), deny of Brahman the properties of non-sentient matter. From this it follows that the relation of the two can only be that of distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished, and hence of part and whole. Brahman distinguished by sentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle state is the cause; distinguished by the same beings in their gross state is the effect: the effect thus is non-different from the cause, and by the knowledge of the causal Brahman the effect is likewise known. All these tenets are in full mutual agreement. Brahman&amp;rsquo;s freedom from defects also is preserved; and this and Brahman&amp;rsquo;s being the abode of all blessed qualities prove that Brahman possesses the &amp;rsquo;twofold characteristics.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the coils of the snake.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;30&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(There is something) higher than that; on account of the designations of bridge, measure, connexion, and difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sūtras now proceed to refute an erroneous view based on some fallacious arguments, viz. that there is a being higher even than the highest Brahman, the supreme cause, material as well as operative, of the entire world&amp;ndash;a refutation which will confirm the view of Brahman being free from all imperfections and a treasure as it were of countless transcendentally exalted qualities.&amp;ndash;There is some entity higher than the Brahman described so far as being the cause of the world and possessing the twofold characteristics. For the text &amp;lsquo;That Self is a bank (or bridge), a boundary&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 4, 1) designates the Self as a bank or bridge (setu). And the term &amp;lsquo;setu&amp;rsquo; means in ordinary language that which enables one to reach the other bank of a river; and from this we conclude that in the Vedic text also there must be meant something to be reached. The text further says that that bridge is to be crossed:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is no truth in the assertion that from the designation of the Highest as a biidge (or bank) it follows that there is something beyond the Highest. For Brahman in that text is not called a bank with regard to something to be reached thereby; since the additional clause &amp;lsquo;for the non-confounding of these worlds&amp;rsquo; declares that it is compared to a bridge or bank in so far as it binds to itself (&lt;em&gt;setu&lt;/em&gt; being derived from śi, to bind) the whole aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things without any confusion. And in the clause &amp;lsquo;having passed beyond that bridge&amp;rsquo; the &lt;em&gt;passing beyond&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;reaching&lt;/em&gt;; as we say, &amp;lsquo;he passes beyond the VedAnta,&amp;rsquo; meaning &amp;lsquo;he has fully mastered it.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 12, 6), they do so for the purpose of thought, i.e. meditation, only. For as texts such as &amp;rsquo;the Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; teach Brahman, the cause of the world, to be unlimited, it cannot in itself be subject to measure. The texts referring to measure therefore aim at meditation only, in the same way as texts such as &amp;lsquo;Speech is one foot (quarter) of him, breath another, the eye another, the mind another&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. III, 18, 2).&amp;ndash;But how can something that in itself is beyond all measure, for the purpose of meditation, be spoken of as measured? To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Being about to investigate the nature of meditation, the Sūtrakāra now declares that the meditating devotee receives the reward of meditation, i.e. Release, which consists in attaining to the highest Person, from that highest Person only: and that analogously the rewards for all works prescribed by the Veda&amp;ndash;whether to be enjoyed in this or the next world&amp;ndash;come from the highest Person only. The Sūtra therefore says generally, &amp;lsquo;from thence the reward.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Why so?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Because that only is possible.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. IV, 4, 24); and &amp;lsquo;For he alone causes delight&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7).&amp;ndash;Next a primā facie view is stated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;39&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the same reasons Jaimini (thinks it to be) religious action.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reasons, viz. possibility and scriptural declaration, the teacher Jaimini thinks that religious works, viz. sacrifices, gifts, offerings, and meditation, of themselves bring about their rewards. For we observe that in ordinary life actions such as ploughing and the like, and charitable gifts and so on, bring about their own reward, directly or indirectly. And although Vedic works do not bring about their rewards immediately, they may do so mediately, viz. by means of the so-called &lt;em&gt;apūrva&lt;/em&gt;. This follows also from the form of the Vedic injunctions, such as &amp;lsquo;He who is desirous of the heavenly world is to sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; As such injunctions enjoin sacrifices as the means of bringing about the object desired to be realised, viz. the heavenly world and the like, there is no other way left than to assume that the result (which is seen not to spring directly from the sacrifice) is accomplished by the mediation of the apūrva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;40&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But the former, Bādarāyaṇa (thinks), on account of the designation (of deities) as the cause.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reverend Bādarāyaṇa maintains the previously declared awarding of rewards by the Supreme Person since the scriptural texts referring to the different sacrifices declare that the deities only, Agni, Vāyu, and so on, who are propitiated by the sacrifices&amp;ndash;which are nothing else but means to propitiate deities&amp;ndash;are the cause of the rewards attached to the sacrifices. Compare texts such as &amp;lsquo;Let him who is desirous of prosperity offer a white animal to Vāyu. For Vāyu is the swiftest god. The man thus approaches Vāyu with his proper share, and Vāyu leads him to prosperity.&amp;rsquo; And the whole instruction which the texts give, as to the means by which men desirous of certain results are to effect those results, is required on account of the injunctions only, and hence it cannot be doubted that&lt;/p&gt;</description>
