10. 'There is purposelessness'; not so, on account of the dependence on that.

But if conduct has no result, it follows that good conduct,

as enjoined in the Smr̥tis, is useless!--Not so, we reply; for holy works enjoined by the Veda depend on conduct, in so far as a man of good conduct only is entitled to perform those works. This appears from passages such as the following: 'A man who is not pure is unfit for all religious work,' and 'Him who is devoid of good conduct the Vedas do not purify.' Cārshṇājini's view thus is, that the caraṇa of the text implies karman.
