3. And on account of the going of the prāṇas.

That the soul goes embedded in the subtle rudiments of the elements follows therefrom also that when passing out of the old body it is said to be followed by the prāṇas, 'when he thus passes out, the chief prāṇa follows after him,' &c. (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2). Compare also Smr̥ti: 'It draws to itself the organs of sense, with the mind for the sixth. When the Ruler (soul) obtains a new body, and passes out of another, he takes with him those organs and then moves on, as the wind takes the odours from their abodes (the flowers)' (Bha. Gī. XV, 8). But the prāṇas cannot move without a substrate, and hence we must admit that the rudiments of the elements--which are their substrate--are also moving.
