9. 'On account of conduct'; not so, since (caraṇa) connotes works; thus Kārshṇājini thinks.

In the phrases 'those whose works were good' (ramaṇīya-caraṇāḥ), and 'those whose works were bad' (kapūyā-caraṇāḥ), the word caraṇa does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as the Veda on the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on the other prohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as ordinary language, the term caraṇa is generally used in the sense of ācāra, i.e. general conduct. In ordinary speech such words as ācāra, śīla, vr̥tta are considered synonymous, and in the Veda we read 'whatever works (karmāṇi) are blameless, those should be regarded, not others. Whatever our good conduct (su-caritāni) was, that should be observed by thee, nothing else' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2)--where 'works' and 'conduct' are distinguished. Difference in quality of birth therefore depends on conduct, not on the remainder of works performed with a view to certain results.--This primā facie view the Sūtra sets aside, 'not so,because the scriptural term caraṇa connotes works; thus the teacher Cārshṇājini thinks.' For mere conduct does not lead to experiences of pleasure and pain; pleasure and pain are the results of _works_ in the limited sense.
