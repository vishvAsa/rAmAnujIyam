      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-adhyāya&#34;&gt;THIRD ADHYĀYA.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-pāda&#34;&gt;FIRST PĀDA.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, (as appears) from question and explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That the Vedānta-texts establish as the proper object of meditation, on the part of all men desirous of Release, the highest Brahman, which is the only cause of the entire world, which is not touched by even a shadow of imperfection, which is an ocean, as it were, of supremely exalted qualities, and which totally differs in nature from all other beings&amp;ndash;this is the point proved in the two previous adhyāyas; there being given at the same time arguments to disprove the objections raised against the Vedānta doctrine on the basis of Smr̥ti and reasoning, to refute the views held by other schools, to show that the different Vedānta-texts do not contradict each other, and to prove that the Self is the object of activities (enjoined in injunctions of meditation, and so on). In short, those two adhyāyas have set forth the essential nature of Brahman. The subsequent part of the work now makes it its task to enquire into the mode of attaining to Brahman, together with the means of attainment. The third adhyāya is concerned with an enquiry into meditation&amp;ndash;which is the means of attaining to Brahman; and as the motive for entering on such meditation is supplied by the absence of all desire for what is other than the thing to be obtained, and by the desire for that thing, the points first to be enquired into are the imperfections of the individual soul&amp;ndash;moving about in the different worlds, whether waking or dreaming or merged in dreamless sleep, or in the state of swoon; and those blessed characteristics by which Brahman is raised above all these imperfections. These are the topics of the first and second pādas of the adhyāya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But on account of (water) consisting of the three elements; on account of predominance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water alone could not produce a new body; for the text Cḥ. Up. VI, 3, 4, &amp;lsquo;Each of these he made tripartite,&amp;rsquo; shows that all the elements were&amp;rsquo; made tripartite to the end of producing bodies. That the text under discussion mentions water only, is due to the predominance of water; and that among the elements giving rise to a new body water predominates, we infer from the fact that blood and the other humours are the predominating element in the body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the going of the prāṇas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That the soul goes embedded in the subtle rudiments of the elements follows therefrom also that when passing out of the old body it is said to be followed by the prāṇas, &amp;lsquo;when he thus passes out, the chief prāṇa follows after him,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2). Compare also Smr̥ti: &amp;lsquo;It draws to itself the organs of sense, with the mind for the sixth. When the Ruler (soul) obtains a new body, and passes out of another, he takes with him those organs and then moves on, as the wind takes the odours from their abodes (the flowers)&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XV, 8). But the prāṇas cannot move without a substrate, and hence we must admit that the rudiments of the elements&amp;ndash;which are their substrate&amp;ndash;are also moving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Br̥. Up. III, 2, 13). declares that when a person dies his organs go into fire, and so on.; they cannot therefore accompany the soul. Hence the text which&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first (reply); we say no, for just that (is meant), on the ground of fitness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An objection is raised to the conclusion arrived at under III, 1, 1; on the ground that in the first oblation, described in Cḥ. Up. V, 4, 2, as being made into the heavenly world, water is not mentioned at all as the thing offered. The text says, &amp;lsquo;on that altar the gods offer śraddhā&amp;rsquo;; and by śraddhā (belief) everybody understands a certain activity of mind. Water therefore is not the thing offered.&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply. It is nothing else but water, which there is called śraddhā. For thus only question and answer have a sense. For the question is, &amp;lsquo;Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called man?&amp;rsquo; and at the outset of the reply śraddhā is mentioned as constituting the oblation made into the heavenly world viewed as a fire. If here the word śraddhā did not denote water, question and answer would refer to different topics, and there would be no connexion. The form in which the final statement is introduced (iti tu pañcamyām, &amp;amp;c., &amp;lsquo;but thus in the fifth oblation,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.), moreover, also intimates that śraddhā means water. The word &amp;lsquo;iti,&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;thus&lt;/em&gt;, here intimates that the answer is meant to dispose of the question, &amp;lsquo;Do you know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. Śraddhā becomes moon, rain, food, seed, embryo in succession, and &lt;em&gt;thus&lt;/em&gt; the water comes to be called man. Moreover, the word śraddhā is actually used in the Veda in the sense of &amp;lsquo;water&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;he carries water, śraddhā indeed is water&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Saṁh. I, 6, 8, 1). Aad what the text says as&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;On account of this not being stated by Scripture&amp;rsquo;; not so, on account of those who perform sacrifices and so on being understood.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, a further objection is raised, in the whole section under discussion no mention at all is made of the soul; the section cannot therefore prove that the soul moves, enveloped by water. The text speaks only of different forms of water śraddhā and the rest.&amp;ndash;This, the Sūtra points out, is not so, on account of those who perform sacrifices being understood. For further on in the same chapter it is said, that those who, while destitute of the knowledge of Brahman, practise sacrifices, useful works and alms, reach the heavenly world and become there of the essence of the moon (somarājānaḥ); whence, on the results of their good works being exhausted, they return again and enter on a new embryonic state (Cḥ. Up. V, 10). Now in the preceding section (V, 9) it is said that they offer śraddhā in the heavenly world, and that from that oblation there arises the king Soma&amp;ndash;an account which clearly refers to the same process as the one described in V, 10. We herefrom infer that what is meant in V, 9 is that that being which was distinguished by a body of śraddhā, becomes a being distinguished by a body of the nature of the moon. The word body denotes that the nature of which it is to be the attribute of a soul, and thus cxtends in its connotation up to the soul. The meaning of the section therefore is that it is the soul which moves enveloped by water and the other rudimentary elements.&amp;ndash;But the phrase &amp;lsquo;him the gods eat&amp;rsquo; (V, 10, 4) shows that the king Soma cannot be the soul, for that cannot be eaten!&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or it is metaphorical, on account of their not knowing the Self. For thus Scripture declares.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He who performs sacrifices, and so on, and thus does not know the Self, is here below and in yonder world a mere&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;means of enjoyment for the devas. He serves them here, by propitiating them with sacrifices, and so on; and when the gods, pleased with his service, have taken him up into yonder world, he there is a common means of enjoyment for them (since they are gratified by the presence of a faithful servant). That those not knowing the Self serve and benefit the gods, Scripture explicitly declares, &amp;lsquo;He is like a beast for the devas&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 4, 10). Smr̥ti also declares, that while those who know the Self attain to Brahman, those who do not know it are means of enjoyment for the devas, &amp;lsquo;To the gods go the worshippers of the gods, and they that are devoted to me go to me&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. VII, 23). When Scripture speaks of the soul being eaten by the gods, it therefore only means that the soul is to them a source of enjoyment. That eating the soul means no more than satisfaction with it, may also be inferred from the following scriptural passage, &amp;lsquo;The gods in truth do not eat nor do they drink; by the mere sight of that amr̥ta they are satisfied.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;It thus remains a settled conclusion that the soul moves enveloped by the subtle rudiments of the elements.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the obtaining of another body.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the passing away of the works, with a remainder, according to Scripture and Smr̥ti; as it went and not so.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text declares that those who only perform sacrifices and useful works ascend by the road of the fathers, and again return to the earth when they have fully enjoyed the fruit of their works, &amp;lsquo;having dwelt there yāvat saṁpātam, they return by the same way&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. V, 10, 5). The question here arises whether the descending soul carries a certain remainder (anuśaya) of its works or not.&amp;ndash;It does not, since it has enjoyed the fruit of all its works. For by &amp;lsquo;anuśaya&amp;rsquo; we have to understand that part of the karman which remains over and above the part retributively enjoyed; but when the fruit of the entire karman has been enjoyed, there is no such remainder. And that this is so we learn from the phrase &amp;lsquo;yāvat saṁpātam&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;On account of conduct&amp;rsquo;; not so, since (caraṇa) connotes works; thus Kārshṇājini thinks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the phrases &amp;rsquo;those whose works were good&amp;rsquo; (ramaṇīya-caraṇāḥ), and &amp;rsquo;those whose works were bad&amp;rsquo; (kapūyā-caraṇāḥ), the word caraṇa does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as the Veda on the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on the other prohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as ordinary language, the term caraṇa is generally used in the sense of ācāra, i.e. general conduct. In ordinary speech such words as ācāra, śīla, vr̥tta are considered synonymous, and in the Veda we read &amp;lsquo;whatever works (karmāṇi) are blameless, those should be regarded, not others. Whatever our good conduct (su-caritāni) was, that should be observed by thee, nothing else&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2)&amp;ndash;where &amp;lsquo;works&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;conduct&amp;rsquo; are distinguished. Difference in quality of birth therefore depends on conduct, not on the remainder of works performed with a view to certain results.&amp;ndash;This primā facie view the Sūtra sets aside, &amp;rsquo;not so,because the scriptural term caraṇa connotes works; thus the teacher Cārshṇājini thinks.&amp;rsquo; For mere conduct does not lead to experiences of pleasure and pain; pleasure and pain are the results of &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; in the limited sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This appears from passages such as the following: &amp;lsquo;A man who is not pure is unfit for all religious work,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Him who is devoid of good conduct the Vedas do not purify.&amp;rsquo; Cārshṇājini&amp;rsquo;s view thus is, that the caraṇa of the text implies karman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This opinion of Bādari, the author of the Sūtra states as representing his own. On the other hand, he adopts the view of Kārshṇajini in so far as he considers such items of virtuous &lt;em&gt;conduct&lt;/em&gt; as the Sandhyā&amp;ndash;which are enjoined by scriptural texts, the existence of which is inferred on the basis of conduct as enjoined by Smr̥ti&amp;ndash;to have the result of qualifying the agent for the performance of other works.&amp;ndash;The conclusion therefore is that the souls descend, carrying a remnant of their works.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the passing of works.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The question now arises whether those also who do not perform sacrifices go to the moon. The phrase &amp;lsquo;who do not perform sacrifices&amp;rsquo; denotes evil-doers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;of two kinds, viz. those who do not do what is enjoined, and those who do what is forbidden.&amp;ndash;These also go to the moon, the Pūrvapakshin maintains; for the text contains a statement to that effect, &amp;lsquo;All who depart from this world go to the moon&amp;rsquo; (Ka. Up. I, 2)&amp;ndash;where it is said that all go, without any distinction. So that those who perform good works and those who perform evil works, equally go to the moon.&amp;ndash;This the next Sūtra negatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But, of knowledge and work&amp;ndash;as these are the leading topics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the view developed so far. It cannot be admitted that those also who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, reach the moon; because the path of the gods and the path of the fathers are meant for the enjoyment of the fruits &amp;lsquo;of knowledge and work.&amp;lsquo;That is to say&amp;ndash;as those who do not perform sacrifices cannot ascend by the path of the gods, since they are destitute of knowledge; so they also cannot go by the path of the fathers, since they are destitute of meritorious works. And that these two paths are dependent respectively on knowledge and works, we know from the fact that these two are the leading topics. For knowledge forms the leading topic with regard to the path of the gods,&amp;lsquo;Those who know this, and those who in the forest follow faith and austerities, go to light,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.; and works have the same position with regard to the path of the fathers,&amp;ldquo;they who living in a village perform sacrifices, &amp;amp;c. go to the smoke,&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;c. The text, &amp;lsquo;all those who depart from this world go to the moon,&amp;rsquo; must therefore be interpreted to mean &amp;lsquo;all those who perform sacrifices go to the moon.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;But if evil-doers do not go to the moon, the fifth oblation cannot take place, and no new body can be produced. For the text says, &amp;lsquo;In the fifth oblation water is called man,&amp;rsquo; and, as we have shown, that fifth oblation presupposes the soul&amp;rsquo;s going to the moon. In order, therefore, to understand how in their case also a new embodiment is possible, it must needs be admitted that they also ascend to the moon.&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not in the case of the third (place), as it is thus perceived.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third &amp;lsquo;place&amp;rsquo; does not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation. The term,&amp;rsquo;the third&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;place,&amp;rsquo; denotes mere evil-doers. That these do not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation, is seen from Scripture. For, in answer to the question &amp;lsquo;Do you know why that world never becomes full?&amp;rsquo; the text says, &amp;lsquo;On neither of these two ways are those small creatures continually returning, of whom it may be said, Live and die. This is the third place. Therefore that world never becomes full.&amp;rsquo; As this passage states that in consequence of &amp;rsquo;the third place&amp;rsquo; (i.e. the creatures forming a third class) not ascending to and descending from the heavenly world that world never becomes full, it follows that that third place does not, for the origination of bodies, depend on the fifth oblation. The clause, &amp;lsquo;in the fifth oblation,&amp;rsquo; moreover, merely states that the connexion of water with the fifth fire is the cause of the water &amp;lsquo;being called man&amp;rsquo; (i. e. becoming an embryo), but does not deny the origination of embryos in other ways; for the text contains no word asserting such a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VI, 3, 1). It is observed that from among these beings those springing from a germ and those springing from heat originate without that fifth oblation.&amp;ndash;But the text quoted does not refer to the creatures springing from heat; for it says that there are three origins only!&amp;ndash;To this the next Sūtra replies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The settled conclusion therefore is that the evil-doers do not go to the moon.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;those who do not perform sacrifices.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;22&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being a reason.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text describes the manner in which those who perform sacrifices, and so on, descend from the moon as follows: &amp;lsquo;They return again that way as they came, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then having become air they become smoke, having become smoke they become mist,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The doubt here arises whether the soul when reaching ether, and so on, becomes ether in the same sense as here on earth it becomes a man or other being, or merely becomes similar to ether, and so on.&amp;ndash;The former view is the true one; for as the soul in the śraddhā state becomes the moon, so it must likewise be held to &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; ether, and so on, there being no reason for a difference in the two cases.&amp;ndash;This primā facie view the Sūtra sets aside. The descending soul enters into similarity of being with ether, and so on; since there is a reason for this. When the soul becomes a man or becomes the moon, there is a reason for that, since it thereby becomes capacitated for the enjoyment of pain and pleasure. But there is no similar reason for the soul becoming ether, and so on, and hence the statement that the soul becomes ether, and so on, can only mean that, owing to contact with them, it becomes similar to them.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;entering into similarity of being.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For there is a special statement, i.e. the text says that when the soul has become rice or grain or the like, the passing out of that stage is beset with difficulties. From this we infer that as there is no such statement concerning the earlier stages, the soul stays at each of them for a short time only.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the not very long time.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;24&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Into (plants) animated by other souls, because the statement is as in the previous cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text declares that (he descending souls are born as rice, corn, &amp;amp;c., &amp;rsquo;they are born here as rice, corn, herbs, trees,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The question here is whether the souls cling to plants animated by other souls which have those plants for their bodies; or whether the descending souls themselves are born with those plants for their bodies.&amp;ndash;The latter view is the right one; for the text says, &amp;rsquo;they are born as rice, grain,&amp;rsquo; and so on, and this expression is of the same kind as when we say &amp;lsquo;he is born as a man, as a deva,&amp;rsquo; and so on. The text therefore means that the souls are embodied in the different plants.&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra rejects. The souls merely cling to those plants which constitute the bodies of other souls; &amp;lsquo;since the statement is as in the previous cases,&amp;rsquo; i.e. because the text only says that the souls become plants as it had previously been said that they become ether, and so on. Where the text means to say that the soul enters on the condition of an enjoying soul (i.e. of a soul assuming a new body for the purpose of retributive enjoyment), it refers to the deeds which lead to such enjoyment; so e. g. in the passage, &amp;lsquo;Those whose works have been good obtain a good birth,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. But in the text under discussion there is no such reference to karman. For those works&amp;ndash;viz. sacrifices and the like&amp;ndash;which were undertaken with a view to reward, such as enjoyment of the heavenly world, are, in the case of the descending souls, completely wiped out by the enjoyment of the heavenly world (which precedes the descent of the souls); and those works on the other hand, the action of which has not yet begun, lead to the embodiments mentioned&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;25&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion arrived at above cannot be accepted, since there is a reason why the descending soul should enter on the condition of an enjoying soul. Such works as sacrifices, the fruit of which is the enjoyment of the heavenly world, are mixed with evil, for they imply injury to living beings as in the case of the goat offered to Agnīshomau. And such injury is evil as it is forbidden by texts such as &amp;rsquo;let him not harm any creature.&amp;rsquo; Nor can it be said that the injunctions of sacrificing animals constitute exceptions to the general rule of not harming any creature.&amp;ndash;For the two injunctions refer to different things. The injunction to kill the goat for Agnīshomau intimates that the killing of the animal subserves the accomplishment of the sacrifice, while the injunction not to &amp;lsquo;harm&amp;rsquo; teaches that such harming has disastrous consequences. Should it be said that the prohibition of harming does not refer to such actions as the sacrifice of the goat which proceed on the basis of scriptural injunction, but only to such actions as spring from natural passion or desire (rāga); we remark that in the case of sacrifices also the action is equally prompted by natural desire. Injunctions such as &amp;lsquo;He who desires the heavenly world is to sacrifice&amp;rsquo;, teach that sacrifices are to be undertaken by persons desirous of certain pleasant results, and such persons having thus learned by what means the result is to be accomplished proceed to action from the natural desire of the result. This applies to the killing of the goat also which is offered to Agnīshomau; man learns from Scripture that such actions help to accomplish the sacrifice which effects the result, and then performs those actions from natural desire. The case in no way differs from that of harm&lt;/p&gt;</description>
