11. But only good and evil works, thus Bādari thinks.

As the verb ā-car takes karman for its object (puṇyaṁ karmā carati, &c.), and as the separate denotation (i.e. the use of apparently equivalent words, viz. ācar and karman) can be accounted for on the ground that one of them refers to works established by manifest texts, and the other to texts inferred from actually existing rules of good conduct; and as, when the primary meaning is possible, no secondary meaning must be adopted; nothing else but good and evil works (in the Vedic sense) are denoted by the word caraṇa: such is the opinion of the teacher Bādari. This opinion of Bādari, the author of the Sūtra states as representing his own. On the other hand, he adopts the view of Kārshṇajini in so far as he considers such items of virtuous _conduct_ as the Sandhyā--which are enjoined by scriptural texts, the existence of which is inferred on the basis of conduct as enjoined by Smr̥ti--to have the result of qualifying the agent for the performance of other works.--The conclusion therefore is that the souls descend, carrying a remnant of their works.--Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of 'the passing of works.'
