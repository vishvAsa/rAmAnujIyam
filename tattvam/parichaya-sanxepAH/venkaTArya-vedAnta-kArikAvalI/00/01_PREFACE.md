THE importance of the Vis'iṣṭadvaita system of Vedanta philosophy, lies in the fact that this system derives full support from the Vedic texts. This system has successfully maintained both the difference and non-difference between the Brahman and the world of sentient and non-sentient beings as taught in the Vedic texts. The main principles of this system are based on the relation between the Brahman and the world in the shape of the soul and body. The sentient and non-sentient beings constitute the body of the Brahman as they are invariably resting on Him, and completely controlled by Him. Just as our body is sustained, controlled and engaged for his own purpose by the indwelling soul, all sentient and non-sentient beings also are sustained, controlled and engaged for His own purpose by the Inner Ruler Brahman. This sort of relationship between the Brahman and the world, enables the Vis'iṣṭadvaitin to explain the non- difference between them. At the same time the difference between them is also proved by the clear distinction in their essential nature and characteristics. 

Many works have been written on the basis of this principle. The Vedantakarikavali of Surapuram Bucci Venkaṭācārya is one of them. This is a 

vi 

metrical epitome of the principles accepted in the Vis'iṣṭadvaita system of Vedanta philosophy. The author Bucci Venkaṭācārya was the third son of Aṇṇayarya of the S'ri S'aila family of Bukkapaṭṭanam, near Gutti in Andhrades'a and a protege of Venkata- nayaka, the chief of Surapuram which is said to be between the rivers Krishna and Bhima in Gulbarga Dt., in the Nizam's Dominions. The author's date may be fixed between the last part of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century A.D. 

The work was printed and published about 50 years ago in Telugu and Devanagari scripts. But these publications have not proved to be satisfactory as they contained many mistakes. These editions are not available now. Hence there is no need for an apology for undertaking this edition. In order to facilitate the average readers in understanding the subject correctly, an easy gloss in Sanskrit and a translation in English have been added. beads bas
