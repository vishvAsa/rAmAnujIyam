Sri Ramanuja's Visishtadvaita is noted for the following features: 

- (a) it propounds a credible doctrine of complete identity between God and the Absolute; 
- (b) it harmonises God's transcendence (paratva) with His accessibility (soulabhya); and 
- (c) it inculcates the highest type of devotion without belittling the part of intellectualism and social duties in spiritual life.



While the doctrine first gained articulation as a system of thought in the now unavailable writings of Dramidacharya and later in those of the illustrious Yamunacharya, it was Sri Ramanuja (1017--1137) who put these devotional traditions coming from the Alwars down, into the mould of the Upanishadic thought by embodying them in the form of commentaries based on the Vedantic scriptures.



Since then, several pious and scholarly savants wrote on the doctrines of the system, the most brilliant of them being Sudarsana Suri and Vedanta Desika. There were also several others of lesser calibre and originality but nonetheless noted for their lucid exposition of the system. Among these was the author of the present text Srinivasadasa, disciple of Mahacharya who lived in the later half of the 16th century.



His work, the Yatindramatadipika, is a brief but comprehensive writing on the system, dealing as it does with its epistemology, ontology, psychology, cosmology and theology. As a complete handbook in simple and lucid language, it is one of the best for the study of Visishtadvaita.
