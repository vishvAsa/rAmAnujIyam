JIVA 

1. Now the individual self is explained. The common characteristics of the individual self and Iśvara are self-consciousness, sentiency, selfhood, illumine oneself for oneself. Sentiency consists in being the locus of consciousness. Selfhood consists in having (invariable) relation with the body. Agency consists in being the locus of volitional consciousness.. 

2. The special characteristics of the individual self, whose general attributes have been pointed out

स च देहेन्द्रिय मनः प्राणादिभ्यो विलक्षणः । यथा 'मम शरीरम्' इति प्रतीत्या देहात् व्यावृत्तः । 'चक्षुषा पश्यामि', 'श्रोत्रेण शृणोमि', 'वाचा वदामि' इत्यादिप्रत्यायत् बाह्येन्द्रियेभ्यो व्यावृत्तः । 'मनसा जानामि इति मनसो ज्ञानकरणत्वप्रतीतेः, 'मम प्राणा' इति व्यतिरेकोक्तेः, 'जानामि अहम्' इति ज्ञानाच्च मनः प्राणज्ञानेभ्यो व्यावृत्तः । 

in the above manner, are now set forth (as follows) : while it is monadic, it is sentient. While it is subsi- diary by nature (to Brahman, the principal), it is sentient.1 Likewise the qualities of being supported and controlled, dependency, subserviency have to be inferred. 

Si 3. And it (the jīva) is different from the body, the sense organs, mind, vital breath, etc. It is different from the body as seen in the perception, 'this is my body'. It is distinct from the external sense organs on account of the perception. 'I see with eyes, hear with ears, speak with the organ of speech, etc.' It is distinct from mind, vital breath and consciousness on account of our perception of the mind being the instrument of consciousness as, 'I know by mind', on account of the distinguishing expression as, 'my vital breath' and because of the consciousness as, '1 know' . 2

4. It is monadic in size, since Scripture declares its passing out 3 etc., and (also) because it is in accord- ance with the sources of knowledge. Nor may it be doubted that how the individual self can simultaneously experience. many objects if it were monadic; for it is possible by the pervasiveness of attributive conscious- ness. By this, the simultaneous assumption of many bodies by Saubhari etc. and the liberated selves is possible.

5. It is eternal;s for it recollects the objects experienced in the past. If it (jiva) is eternal, how can the experience that the "individual self is born", that the "individual self is destroyed" be accounted for?' If this be asked, no; for it is established that what is called birth is the individual self's connection with the body and the destruction is its severance from it. The essential nature of the individual self is, indeed, eternal.

6. It is different in each body. Just as there is the usage (of the expression), ‘one jar' when there are many gold jars of a similar size, 'one grain' when there is a heap of grains, so there is the usage of the singular number (with reference to many individual selves) on account of the oneness of consciousness. But not they are identical in their essential nature, since it contradicts evidence.7 

7. It is blissful by nature. The empirical exis- tence (of births and deaths) is due to the force of limiting adjuncts.8 It becomes the agent, the enjoyer, the embodied self and the body. It is the embodied self viewed in relation to primordial matter (i.e., the physical body). It is the body for the sake of Iśvara. 10 Its luminosity is established by the evidence of per- ception and Scripture. The syllogism is as follows: 'The individual self is self-luminous, because it is consciousness, like the attributive consciousness.' The

8. By this (definition of the individual self), the (following ) antitheses are refuted: The thesis of the Buddhists that the individual self is the succession of moments, since consciousness is momentary; the views of the Cārvākas that, since body is composed of the four elements, the individual self is co-extensive with the body; the opinion of the Jainas that the individual self is of the same size as that of the body, since it assumes the size of the elephant in elephant- body and the size of the ant in its body;11 the argument of the Sankhyas that the agency, enjoyment, etc. belong to prakṛti and not to the individual self; the standpoint of Yadavaprakāśa that the individual self is a portion of Brahman; the thesis of Bhaskara that the individual self is a division of the conditioned Brahman; 12 the single-self thesis that (the individual self) is a fabrication of avidya;13 the multi-view

that (the individual self) is the internal-organ-limited consciousness; etc. 14 (Likewise) the school which up- holds the all-pervasiveness (of the individual self is also refuted). 

al 

9. Now if the all-pervasiveness (of the self) is not admitted, how, in other regions, the acquisition of fruits engendered by adṛṣṭa (unseen effects of karma) is possible?' If this be asked, no; for though there is the absence of relation of the individual self (with other regions where it is absent), (the acquisition of fruits) is possible by the power of adṛṣṭa only. What is called adṛṣṭa is a special kind of consciousness,15 generated by a particular kind of action, performed by the individual self, and which produces love or dislike on the part of Bhagavan. This special kind of consciousness is verily the will of Bhagavan and depends on Him whose essential nature is all-pervasive- ness. Therefore the acquisition of fruits is certainly possible (for the individual self); thus there is no contradiction.

10. That jIva is of three kinds, because of the difference as the bound, the freed, and the eternal. Of these, the bound are those who are not freed from the empirical existence. They are those particular kinds of sentient beings from Brahma down to a worm, who are in the shell of the cosmic sphere which constitutes the fourteen worlds. 

11. Brahmā originated from the navel-lotus of Śrīman Nārāyaṇa. From Brahma, Rudra. Again from Brahma were born the yogins beginning with Sanaka, the heavenly sages such as Narada, the Brāhmaṇa sages Vasista, Bhrgu, etc. and the nine Prajāpatis Pulastya, Marici, Daksa, Kaśyapa, etc. From these have origi- nated the devas, the guardians of the quarters, the fourteen Indras, the fourteen Manus, the asuras, the pitrs, the siddhas, the gandharvas, the kinnaras, the kimpurusas, the vidyādharas, etc. the Vasus, the

Rudras, the ādityas, the (two) AŚvins, and the dānavas, the yaksas, the rāksasas, the piśācas, the guhyakas, etc. Thus the race of devas (has been explained). 

12. The human beings are also manifold, because of the difference of classes as brāhmaṇa, kṣattriya, vaiśya, sūdra, etc. The animals also are multifarious, because of the distinction as cattle, beasts, birds, ser- pents, moths, worms, etc. The non-ambulants are of various kinds, because of the difference as trees, thick- ets, creepers, bushes, grass, etc. Trees etc. do have some relation with consciousness which is useful for sucking up water; for it has been said, 'Amongst the non-sentients, it (i.e., consciousness) is meager' (VP., vii, 64). Therefore the bound are divided into groups as the human, the devas, the animals and the non- ambulants. 

13. Again they are divided into egg-born, sprout-born and sweat-born. born are devas and human beings.

Brahmā, Rudra, etc., Sanaka and (other sages), Sītā, Draupadi, Dhrstadyumna, etc., bhūtas, vetalas, etc. are not born of wombs. The animals etc., are born of wombs, eggs and sweat. The sprout-born are the non- ambulants etc. 

14. By virtue of avidya, karma, tendency, hanker- ing and matter-contact, begun from time immemorial which, in the form of an uneven stream and like the unending cycle of seed and sprout, whirl like a wheel, the bound individual selves of such description are sub- jected to the manifold and wonderful states of womb- life, birth, infancy, youth, waking, dream, sleep, uncon- sciousness, old age, death, attainment of heaven, hell, etc.; they suffer the three kinds of unbearable afflictions which are without beginning and of innumerable sorts, and (consequently) are cut off from the experience of Bhagavān—their natural acquisition.जीवः

15. They are (again) of two kinds: the scripture- controlled and the scripture-free. Of these, the bound selves, whose knowledge depends on the sense organs, are controlled by Scripture. That (knowledge) does not exist in animals and non-ambulants. The scripture-con- trolled are of two kinds: bubhuksus (pleasure-seekers) and mumukşus (liberation-seekers). Of these, the bubhu- kṣus are those who are intent on the three kinds of human goals (i.e., dharma, artha and kāma). They are of two kinds: those engrossed in artha and kāma and those solely devoted to dharma. Mere devotees of artha and kama are those (materialists) who think that the body is the self. The devotees of dharma are those who are intent on sacrifice, charity, austerity, pilgrimage, etc. as indicated by the definition, 'Dharma is that which is the means for happiness not relating to this world' and 'Dharma is that which is indicated by the vedic injuction as means to welfare' (PMS., I, i, 2). They are endowed with the knowledge that there is a future existence for the self, different from the body. The devotees of dharma are ( again ) of two kinds, as the devotees of other deities and the

devotees of Bhagavan. The devotees of other deities are those who worship Brahmā, Rudra, Agni, Indra, etc. The devotees of Bhagavan are those qualified persons who are spoken of as 'the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of enjoyment' (BG., VII, 16). The distressed' is he who longs to get back his lost fortune. "The seeker of enjoyment' is he who hankers for fortune not possessed before. 

saṁsāra). 

16. The mumuksus are of two kinds: the votaries of kaivalya (self-realization) and the votaries of moksa (release from samsara). What is called kaivalya is of the nature of the realization of the self as distinct from prakrti; (this realization is effected) by jñāna- yoga. They say that it is (a kind of) self-realization without the realization of Bhagavan-as in the case of a wife who has been deserted by her husband- experienced in some corner of the Highest Abode after reaching it by the Path of Light etc. Some others say that since Scripture 6 does not declare the

return of those who have gone there by the Path of Light, they (i.e., the votaries of kaivalya who are said to return) experience self-realization in some portion of the physical realm itself. 

17. The votaries of moksa are of two kinds : bhaktas (lovers of God) and prapannas (those who have completely resigned themselves to God). The bhaktas are those who have read the Veda together with its auxiliaries and the Upanisads, and who, from the knowledge of the earlier and the latter parts of the Mīmāmsā, have determined the nature of Brahman as different from cit and acit; as essentially of the nature of bliss, infinite and unsurpassable; as opposed to all evil and as comprising in Himself all the auspi- cious qualities. (Having this firm knowledge) they accept bhakti with its limbs, which is the means for the attainment of Him, and by that (bhakti) conceive the desire for the attainment of release.

18. The qualification for the (path of ) bhakti belongs to the (members of the) three varnas 17 only. The devas and the like also are qualified (for bhakti) on account of the possibility of supplication and capability in them. 18 

19. The śūdras are not qualified, since (such qualification) is contrary (to the teachings of) the adhikarana of 'the non-sudras'.19 

20. The essential nature of bhakti has already been explained in the chapter on buddhi (i.e., dharma- bhūtajñāna). The bhaktas are of two kinds, as those who are established in bhakti which is (of the nature. of) means and those who are established in bhakti which is an end ( in itself). Vyāsa and others were established in the bhakti which is (of the nature of) means. Śrī Parankuśa and others were established in bhakti which is an end (in itself). 

21. Prapanna is he who, being characterized by the attributes of 'being helpless and devoid of other refuge', resorts to Bhagavān. 20 He is also of two

kinds, as one who is intent on the three ends of life and one who is intent on the release (the fourth end). The devotee of the three ends is he who appeals to Bhagavan alone for dharma, artha and kāma. The devotee of release, possessing the discrimination of what is eternal and what is non-eternal by means of holy company, becomes dispassionate on account of his disgust for the transmigratory existence; (consequently) the desire for release arises in his (mind), and to attain that goal he takes recourse to a spiritual preceptor who is dis- tinguished by the characteristics of an (ideal) teacher such as (stated in the text) 'the teacher is he who is well versed in the Veda' etc.; (and) through the instru- mentality of that (teacher) he resorts to (the Divine Mother) Śrī who is the mediator 21 (between him and the Lord); (then ) being unable to follow other paths such as bhakti etc., and therefore feeling helpless and refugeless, he takes shelter at the feet of Śrīman Nārāyaṇa as the only means. He (who is of this des- cription) is called prapanna. Everyone (irrespective of caste or profession) is qualified for self-surrender.

22. The prapanna is of two kinds, as the ekān- tin (the one-pointed) and the parama-ekantin (the extremely one-pointed). He is ekantin who seeks from Bhagavan alone liberation along with other (worldly) fruits. The meaning is that to him other gods are simply non-existent. He is parama-ekāntin who does not desire any other fruits even from Bhagavan him- self except devotion and knowledge. He is (again) of two kinds, because of the difference as being dṛpta (patient aspirant ) and ārta ( impatient aspirant ). Drpta is he who experiences the fruits of his previous deeds (as expressed in the saying), 'necessarily it must be experienced'; and desire for the attainment of release at the time of casting off of this body. The arta is he who conceives the longing for release im- mediately after the (act of) self-surrender, since the state of transmigratory existence as is extremely unbearable as the state of being enveloped by blazing flames.

The liberated is one who, after accepting (prapatti) as the means, performs all nitya (regular) and naimittika (incidental) religious duties as ends in themselves, since he regards them as consecrated service enjoined by Bhagavan; who refrains from committing offences against Bhagavan and the votaries of Bhagavan; who, at the moment of giving up the body, commits his merits and demerits to his friends and foes ( respectively ) ; 22 who then, after reposing in the Parmatman abiding in the heart as described in the text, 'The wise should merge the speech in the mind,' etc.23 (Katha Up., III, 13), enters the artery called susumnā, 24 the gateway for release, and issues out (of the body) from the aperture in the crown of the head, called Brahmarandhara; who (then) together with the (Antaryamin) abiding within the heart, reaches the world of Agni through the rays of the sun;2s who (then) is hospitably received on the way by the presiding deities of the day, the first half of lunar month, the summer solstice and the year and also Vāyu; who (then) pierces the orb of the sun, and through the opening of the ether reaches the world

by them in turn, approaches (the hall known as ) Mahamanimaṇḍapa and offers his obeisance to his spiritual teacher near the couch; who goes up to the couch and beholds, together with (His divine consorts) Srī, Bhū and Nīlā, Bhagavān, seated on Ananta who is upon the lotus and which (again) is on the throne made up of dharma etc., served by Vimala and others with chowries in their hands, endowed with the divine weapons of conch and discus, adorned with the innumerable divine ornaments such as the shining crown, fish-shaped ear-rings graiveyahāra, keyūra, kataka, Srivatsa, Kaustubha, muktādāmodara- bandhana, pītāmbara, kāñcīguna, nūpura, etc., and the ocean of auspicious attributes which are bound- less and generous; who then salutes the lotus-feet of Bhagavan with his head, ascends the couch, and is received into the very lap of Bhagavan; who when questioned, 'Who art thou?' replies, I am a mode of Brahman'; who (then) is blessed by the glances of Bhagavan; who, by virtue of that excellent bliss engendered by the communion with Brahman, solely becomes devoted to the diverse service of Bhagavan

suited to all places, all times and all states; in whom ( then ) the eightfold qualities 29 become manifest ; and who becomes established in the communion with Brahman which is devoid of any subsequent limit. 

24. (The statement of Scripture) 30 that the releas- ed individual self attains equality with Brahman31 means that it has equality (with Brahman) in the enjoyment (of bliss only); for it has been declared (in the Vedantasūtras) that (the power of the released self) is devoid of cosmic functions. 32 He can assume manifold forms and wander all over the worlds. 

25. 'Now, how the (individual self) can wander in this world, since it has been declared that the liberated does not return?'33 If this be asked, the reply is no; since the return' due to karma is said not to occur, the roaming according to one's own will, becomes possible. Therefore the liberated individual self by his own will,Y 11

hagavan, roame 

which is in harmony with that of Bhagavan, roams everywhere. 

26. The eternals are Ananta, Garuda, Visvaksena, etc. whose consciousness is devoid of contraction, inasmuch as their activities are never opposed to the will of Bhagavān. Their special duties have been fixed up from time without beginning by the eternal will of Iśvara. The incarnations of these (eternals) are determined by their own will34 like the incarnation of Bhagavan. Thus the individual self, which is divided into (three) groups as the bound, the liberated and the eternal, has been explained.
