Now, the species of the Non-Conscient (Acit), viz., Time, will be treated. Time is (an) inert (substance) devoid of the triad of gunas. It is eternal and infinite. It is triply divisible as Past, Future and Present. It is the time (element) indicated by such terms as Simul- taneous, Immediate, Gradual etc; and is that which constitutes what is in vogue (as time- measures), viz., Nimesha, Kashṭhā, Tatparā, Vinādi, Kalā, Ghațikā, Muhurta,' Day, Half- month, Month, Season, Solstice, Year etc. month by human measure is a day for the Pitrs, whose midday is the New-Moon day The period of a Manu covers seventy one 156 I.e., Satva, Rajas and Tamas. See note 162, p. 66, and (my) Bhagavad Gitā, p. 67.

(Amāvāsya). One year by human measure is a day for the Devas, whose (half) day is the North-summer) solstice, and night the South- (winter) solstice. Measured thus by the Devas' standard, twelve thousand years is called the Four Yugas. Four thousand of these consti- tutes Krta-Yuga, when Virtue (Dharma) is of its full measure. Three thousand of them with three parts of Virtue constitutes the Treta- Yuga. Two thousand with two parts of Vir- tue constitutes the Dvapara. One thousand with one part of Virtue is the Kali-Yuga. Two thousand make up the interim periods (between

the Yugas). The period which makes a day of Brahma is a thousand of these Four-Yugas; and a night (is) of equal duration. A day of Brahma covers (the period of) fourteen Manus, likewise of the Indras and the Seven Ṛshis.

800 years between Kyta and Trda. 600 years between Treta and Dvāpara. 400 years between Dväpara and Kali. 200 years between Kali, and Kyla next.

Likewise is subject to Time the various Dissolutions (Pralayas): Nitya (frequent), Naimittika (occasional), Prā- kṛta (material), etc. For time as Effect, Time itself is the Cause. Infinite time is eternal; finite times are non-eternal. Time so delineat- ed constitutes an ingredient for God's (cosmic) Sport (i.e. Display). In the Lila-Vibhuti,TM God (1śvara) works, subject to Time. Although Time exists in the Nitya-Vibhuti," it is so by His will. Some say that time non-exists, others

aver that Tamasa-Mahān (a category of Matter) is time. But both these positions are contrary to Word (Agama, i.e. Scriptures) and Percep- tion (Pratyaksha). The Acaryas "" affirm that Time is a cognition by the Six Senses (i.e. Mind and the Five Senses of Knowledge); that it is an object of Inference is therefore rejected.
