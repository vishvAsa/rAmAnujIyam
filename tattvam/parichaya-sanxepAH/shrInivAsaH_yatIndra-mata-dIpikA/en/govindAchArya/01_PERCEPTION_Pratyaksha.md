or over-pervasion is the existence of the sign (or definition) in things other than the things to be signified. A-sambhava is the non-existence of the sign (or definition) anywhere. For example the statement (or assertion) that Jiva or the Individual Soul is an object of perception by the eye. 

As therefore these faults are absent in the definition given of Pramana or Means of know- ledge, that definition is well established. 

= 

(Now in the proposition, Pramā-karaṇa Pramāṇa, i.e., the producer of knowledge, is the Means of knowledge, what is meant by Karana, producer, maker or effecter ?). Karaṇa or producer is that which is the best instrument (by which knowledge is obtained). The best instrument is the instrument than which there is none better. Hence it is evident that Pramāṇa or the Means of Knowledge is that instrument than which there is none better by which to obtain (that) knowledge. 

There is a definition of Pramana as that which makes known what is unknown. But those who propose this definition have them- selves refuted it. Hence it is not acceptable.

PERCEPTION 

II 

The Pramānas or the Means of knowledge are three :-(1) Pratyaksha or Perception, " Anumāna or Inference, and Śabda or Word. 

Of these, Perception is the Means which renders knowledge actually sensible (or made manifest to the senses). 'Manifest to the sen- ses' is (a necessary clause) to show its variety from Inference. Pramü or knowledge is to show its character different from what it would be to the vitiated (unsound, defective or diseased) sense. 

This Perception is twofold: Sa-vikalpaka or collective, and Nir-vikalpaka or general. " Nir-vikalpaka or general, is superficial Know- ledge of a thing consisting in its attributes, form etc., obtained at first sight. Sa-vikalpaka, general or particular, is thorough Knowledge of a thing consisting in its attributes, form etc., obtained on deep reflexion (or meditation).

Is., thorough, in popular language. 

** I..., superficial, in popular language. 

34 

Thus Nir-vikalpaka would be shallow, whereas Sa-vikalpaka would be deep, knowledge.12 

 

[Advent 

In both cases, attributes, form etc., are an- cillary sine qua non; for if these ancillaries (or auxiliaries) were absent, the knowledge (of a thing) is neither present" nor known. " 

** 

The process of perception is thus: (1) the soul's" contact with the mind, (2) the mind " with the sense, and (3) the sense" with the object." 

The invariable function of the senses is to illuminate the object to be perceived. (For example), the contiguity of the sense, eye etc., with the object, pot etc., causes the ocular knowledge: "This is the pot ". Thus also are the tactual and other perceptions. In the per- ception of a thing, contact is the connexion. In the perception of the form etc., of a thing, (the relation or connection called) Samavāya or An-upalambha is the scientific term. It means that a thing devoid of attributes, form etc., is beyond recognition or perception.

The perceptions Nir-vikalpaka (or general) and Sa-vikalpaka (particular)" are twofold: Arvacina or memorial" (lit. recent) and An- arvăcina or non-memorial "(= ancient or primal lit. remote). The memorial again is twofold: sense-helped and sense-unhelped. 

The sense-unhelped is twofold: Svayam- siddha or self-ascertained, and Divya or divine. Self-ascertained is what is engendered by Yoga or deep meditation. Divine is what is caused by Bhagavan's (God's) Grace.

[Advent 

This non-memorial (perception) is passingly re- ferred to. 

Thus Pratyaksha or Sense-Perception is that which generates Sakshātkāra, or knowledge, sense-evident. 

But an objection may be put forward thus:- Prama or knowledge has been defined to be knowledge as is actually consonant (or consistent) with experience. This condition is also found present in Smrti or memory; hence memory or recollection must also be counted as a Means of knowledge. How then are such Means (pra- māņas) stated to be only Three?**" 

To this objection it is said: Even if memory be admited as a Means,it is dependent on Sams- kara," or residua left of previous experiences, and these residua are dependent on (sense-) perception. Hence memory is included (or 

* L., Perception, Inference, or Inductive Reason- ing, and Word or Revelation. 

" Bhasha-pariccheda says: "Samskara, called think- ing (bhavana), resides in sentient beings; and is imperceptible to the senses. Certainty, devoid of inattention in its constituent, is its cause. It is also described to be the cause of memory and recog- nition. See also p. 95, Dr. Morell's Mental Philosophy.

involved) in perception, and there is no need to constitute it into a distinct Means or Authority. 

Hence the Means (or Authorities or Instru- ments of knowledge) become determined as Three (only.) 

Memory or Recollection is Knowledge derived from the residua or impressions left of a pre- vious (or past) experience. The excitants (that rouse the dormant residua into remembrance) 

are as per verse: 

Sadrsa'dṛshfa-cinta'dyaiḥ 

Smṛti-bijasya bādhakāḥ. 

48 

Sometimes the excitant is the sight of some- thing similar (previously sensed); sometimes an unseen (or unexpected) fate (adṛshfa); some- times deep musing. Similarity is thus (exempli- fied): (1) If two (individuals) Devadatta and Yajñadatta had once been seen together, the sight of Devadatta excites the remembrance of Yajñadatta. (2) The second is the unexpected (i. e., unconscious cerebration) leaping into

memory, of what has previously been experienc- ed (sensed), such as the Holy Place Śrīrangam.” (3) The Third is the calling into memory (cons- cious cerebration) such as the bewitching divine Image of Venkateśa " (before sensed). What is well experienced engenders constant remem- brance. Forgetfulness is caused by much time elapsing (after the prior experience) or by sickness etc., which weaken the residua (Sams- kāras). "1

recollection (Pratyabhijna) also is included therein such as: this Devadatta is that'. 

Abhava or non-existence" is also in our School included in Perception inasmuch as non- existence (of a thing) implies (its) existence (at some other place or time), (thus illustrated):- The non-existence" of the pot implies clay- (its, i.e. pot's) pre-existence. The destruction s of the pot implies potsherds.

What then is to be erroneous or illusory (in the Perception)? Illusoriness (Bhrama) is the absence (Bādha) or hindrance to any action arising on a correct apprehension of a thing. We shall discuss it. Thus:- 

By virtue of the quintuplicatory combination (or process) of the elements (Bhitas)," all the elements are present in all the (compounds), such as Earth" etc. Hence silver must be present in the pearl-oyster, causing realness (or reality) of the cognition thereof.

When a (white) conch-shell is seen as yellow and so forth, (the explanation is that) the bilious" rays proceeding from the eye unite with the conch-shell etc., and the yellow of the bile" (in the eye) overpowering the white of the shell, is not cognized. Hence a yellow shell is

visualised like a shell gold-plated (or gold-gilt), The yellowness, because it is subtle and issues from the eye, is perceivable by that eye (alone). 

The crystal-stone placed in juxtaposition to a China-rose is perceived as red. This perception is also of the real. 

As observed already, by reason of the quin- tuplication of elements, the cognition of water in the mirage is also valid. 

The process, (known as) the elemental quin- tuplication (Pañct-Karana) will be described further on. 

Mistaking the direction (Dig-bhrama) is also of the same character, for one direction (or point of the compass) is involved in another; for all such distinctions of direction cannot be except by division; else no such thing as direction (Dik) is admissible. " 

In the circle described by a fire-brand etc., the cognition (as circle instead of point) arises from the rapidity of the revolution which sets

67 

The reflexion of one's face in the mirror etc., is also of a fact; for the eye-rays are intercepted by the mirror, and the eye sees along with the mirror etc.," its own face etc., Even in this case the process is so rapid as to prevent the per- ception of all that may intervene between (the eye and the mirror). 

In such cases as the cognition of a double moon (instead of one) it is caused through the pressure of the finger (on the eye), or owing to eye-affections (timira) etc., when the visual rays stream in different directions. The appara- tus being thus duplicated, independent of each other, causes the double-moon vision.98 The

duplication of the apparatus being a fact, the double-moon cognition takes place. 

Hence all cognitions are of the real, and their contents (are provided by) concrete (i.e. attri- butived) objects; for an attribute-less (or quality-less) object is never cognizable. 

09 

Perception then as enunciated (above), appre- hends difference alone. When difference (Bheda) is posited, it (always) implies a counter-entity, but never " (when viewed) as in itself. Hence the two faults are absent, viz., An-avasthā or infinite regress, and Anyo'nyâ”śraya or mutual

"" This would appear to mean that when a jar is cognised, it is so cognised as different from a counter- entity which is not a jar, but say a club. Difference thereof is of different objects, not in the same object itself, i.e., difference, inherent. In other words, every transaction necessarily involves differences and implies counter-entities, which are inadmissible in the province of essentiality. The jarness of a jar is its essentiality. Its distinction from a rod is its difference.

It may be asked why: thou art the tenth',' should not also be classed under Perception? We say 'no', for though Thou' is certainly a sensuous fact (Pratyaksha), 'the tenth thou art' is a cognition which has arisen from (an uttered) sentence. But if it be contended that: 'thou art the tenth' ought to fall under Sensuous Perception, then (by parity of reasoning): 'thou "1 Known as the circular argument, or begging the question (petitio principii).
