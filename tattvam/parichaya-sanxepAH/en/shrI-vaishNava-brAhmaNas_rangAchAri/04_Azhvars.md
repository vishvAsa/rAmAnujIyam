+++
The Azhvars who are recognized and whose writings have been codified into what is now called "The Nalayiraprabandham" are twelve in number. They are detailed below according to their traditional dates of birth which is stated in each case :- I. Ancient- Poigai Āzhvar (Sarayogin). Born B.C. ४२०३.

Bhutat Āzhvar (Bhūta yōgin). Born B.C ४२०३.

Peyazhvar (Mahat or Bhranta yōgin). Born B.C. ४२०३ Tirumahisai Azhvar. Born B C. ४२०३.

II. Middle- Nammāzhvar (Śathakopan). Born BC. ३१०२.

Maduraikavi Āzhvar. Born B.C. ३१०२.

Kulaśekhara Āzhvar. Born B.C ३०७५ Periya Āzhvar (Vishnuchitta). Born B.C. ३०५६.

Andal (Goda). Born. B.C. ३००५ III. Recent- Tondaradippodi Āzhvar (Bhaktanghrirēnu). Born BC २८१४.

Tiruppani Āzhvar (Yogi Vahana). Born. B.C. २७६०.

Tirumangai Āzhvar (Parakāla). Born B.C. २७०६.

In the above enumeration of Azhvars it is seen that some are recent and some middle while others are ancient. The nearest dates of birth of all these Āzhvars as held by the orthodox Sri Vaishnava community are also given. On going through the dates of birth we find that all of them were born before Christ and the last of them about २,७०० years before Christ; in other words the last of them was born ४,६२७ years ago and the earliest or the first ६,१३० years ago. Several amongst modern critics are not disposed to give to the Āzhvars any antiquity and so they place them only in the ४th, ५th or ६th century A.D. The dates given according to the traditional account are considered by them to be fanciful and untrustworthy. There are a few critics who say that the Azhvārs must have been contemporaneous with Ramanuja or that they flourished after him. Both these views are considered by Sri Vaishnavas to be preposterous and to have no basis of any kind to support them.

The heirarchy and the dates in which the various Āzhvārs flourished and which the Sri Vaishnavas believe as true is based on their Guruparamparas which is a traditional account of their Acharyas and Azhvārs. The account given in the Guruparamparas of the Āzhvārs and Acharyas down to Ramanuja, the great Reformer, is similar in both the Vadagalai and Tengalai Guruparamparas.

As regards the individual lives of these Āzhvars and Acharyas modern scholars question the ages assigned to some of them. Some of the Acharyas are held to have lived २५ years, while others to the ripe age of १३५. These ages are considered by the present day English knowing scholars to be rather high, and they allow only ८० or ९० years of age as the maximum. Sri Vaishnavas consider that these scholars ignore two important facts In the first place, the Āzhvars and prominent Āchāryas were men of great intellectual capacity and ability and so they were above the average level of men in general.

Secondly, even ordinary men are now known to live over १३० years of age, if we believe the accounts given in the daily paper" Hindu" and a review, the " Indian Review." For example there is in one of the issues of the daily "Hindu" in the month of August १९२७ a photograph of a person named zara Aga whose present age is १४६ years. The same photograph was also reproduced by the Indian Review in the September number of the year १९२७, in page ६००. The "Swadesamitran" a Tamil daily published at Madras, in its issue of ११th October १९२७, announced that a Muhammadan Saint named Syed Habib Alat Roon, who hailed from Medina and who was living at Hyderabad (in Nizam's Dominions) breathed his last in his १३०th year.

The Sri Vaishnava Brahmans do not worry themselves as to the correctness or otherwise of the dates of birth or the periods in which their Āzhvars flourished. They are content with the view stated in their Guruparamparas and believe in the traditional account given in it. To most orthodox Vaishnavites it is immaterial whether an Āzhvār was born ten thousand years ago, or in recent times; they are particular only about the correctness of their views and the proper understanding of such truths as are set forth by the Āzhvars and Āchāryas. According to these men, the antiquity or modernness of the Āzhvars and Āchāryas do not in any way detract from the value of the spiritual truths promulgated by them and the faith excited remains unaffected by such accidents.

Most of these Āzhvars composed and promulgated their views in Tamil, although a few amongst them have also written in Sanskrit. However, it is the Tamil writings of these Āzhvars that are prominent and these have been codified into the ४,००० or the Nalayiraprabandham. All the writings contained in this Prabandham are in the form of verses full of piety and devotion. These verses are called "Pāśurams" in Tamil. The religious truths enshrined in them are not very different from those inculcated in the Sanskrit Vedas and important Puranas. Consequently the Prabandham is considered to be as sacred as the Vedas and in confirmation of this view it is often spoken of as the Tamil Vedas. The equality of the Prabandham with the Sanskrit Vedas is recognized and so both of them are referred to to-day by the use of the term "Ubhaya Vedantam".

From the Prabandham many stanzas may be quoted to prove that the views held regarding God and this world are exactly the same as are expressed in the Sanskrit Vedas. As examples a few stanzas are selected and are quoted below. From a perusal [[०१६]]
The Sri Vaishnava Brahmans. II of these it will be seen that Āzhvars expressed ideas about God and Tatvas almost identical with what is found in Vedic writings and Sanskrit Purāṇas. First we may quote from "Tiruccanda Vrittam" of Tirumahisai Āzhvar:---

पूनिलाय वैन्दुमाय्प् पुऩऱ्कणिऩऱ नाऩगुमाय् ती निलाय मूऩ्ऱुमाय्च् चिऱन्दगा लिरण्डुमाय् मीनिलाय तॊऩ ऱुमागि वेऱुवेऱु तऩ्मैयाय् नी निलायवण्णम् निऩ्ऩैयार निऩैगगवल्लरे.

(तिरुच्चन्दविरुत्तम् -I)

"Oh! My Lord! you are the supporter of the five qualities pertaining to earth (sound, touch, form, taste and smell), the four qualities of water (sound, touch, form and taste), the three qualities of fire (sound, touch and form), the two qualities belonging to air (sound and touch) and the single quality of sound possessed by ether or sky; you are also the supporter of devas and other things that are separate from you. Who can or who is able to guess how you are supporting and your true self."

ऐन्दुमैन्दु मैन्दुमागि अल्लवऱ्ऱु ळायुमाय ऐन्दुमूऩऱु मॊऩ्ऱुमागि निऩ्ऱवादि तेवऩे ! ऐन्दुमैन्दु मैन्दुमागि अन्तरत्तणैन्दु निऩ्ऱु ऐनदुमैन्दु मायनिऩ्ऩै यावा काण वल्लरे (तिरुच्चन्दविरुत्तम -३)

"Oh! Lord, who is the First! You are the supporter of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), of the five senses of knowledge (touch, sight, hearing, taste and smell), of the five senses of action (mouth, hands, feet, buttocks (thighs !) and organs of excretion and generation), the five tanmātras of śabda, sparśa, rūpa, rasa and gandha, and thus you are supporting not only these twenty-four tatvas, but you are permeating all the living beings (so far the reference is to the Lila vibhūti of God or existence on this earth or universe). You are also staying in Paramapada wherein you are the supporter of five śaktis, five jñānēndriyas, and five karmēndriyas, the five enjoyable sensual effects (all unconnected with this earth and hence different in nature) and the influencer of bhogasthānam, bhogōpākaranam, munis and muktas." (This latter part refers to his Nitya vibhūti or his existence in Vaikuntha.)

"Oh Lord who is the First Cause! You are permeating as ātman all the lifeless and living things that are varied in shape and form; and how you do this will remain inexplicable for ever and to all wise men. Are you not the creator of the four-faced Brahma from your navel formerly?" २-A [[०१७]]

"Just as the ocean having waves that arise and spread in it and which has white spaces, possesses also the power of causing the subsidence of the waves in itself, so you alone have the power by which all movable and immovable things originate and die and finally get absorbed in you." उलगुदऩ्ऩै नीबडैत्तियुळ्ळॊडुक्कि वैददिमीण्डु उलगुदऩऩुळे पिऱत्ति ओरिडत्तै यल्लैयाल् उलगु निऩ्ऩॊ टॊऩ ऱिनिऱ्क वेऱुनिऱ्ऱि यादलाल् उलगिल्निऩऩै युळ्ळसूऴल् यावरुळळ वल्लरे?

"You have created the universe; you have kept the universe within yourself; again you have appeared in this world as avatars; it is impossible to think of you as belonging to a place; the whole universe is your body and yet you have a separate existence in Vaikuntha. Hence who could know your wonderful states?" एकमूर्त्ति मूऩ्ऱुमूर्गदि नालुमूात्ति नऩ्मैसेर् पोगमूात्ति पुण्यत्तिऩ मूात्तियॆण्णिल् मूर्त्तियाय् नागमूात्ति सयऩमाय नलङ्गडऱ किडन्दुमेल् आगमूाददियाय वण्णमॆऩ कॊल्? आदि तेवऩे! (तिरुच्चन्दविरुददम् - १७ )

"Oh Lord! the cause of everything in this universe, who is existing in Vaikuntha as Paravāsudēva and who appears as the three vyūhas Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, as the four mūrtis Pradhana, Purusha, Avyakta and Kala, as the Bhoga mūrti in which all the good is embodied, as the Punya mūrti and innumerable mūrtis and finally lying on the Adi Sesha, on the ocean of milk and as Archavatara.

"Oh blind men that worship the various devatas whose very forms are hideous, whose stories are most unpleasant to hear, who even if sought for help are incapable of giving you the help you very much desire and those who thereby become worse, can you not get rid of the samsara in which you are entangled by worshipping the true one God who is mine?" ताऩे उलगॆल्लाम ताऩे पडैत्तिडन्दु ताऩे उण्डु मिऴन्दु ताऩे याळ् वाऩे.

"Permeating everything in this universe, creating all the universe, swallowing the universe and giving out the same, He is the Lord of everything." All the writings of Āzhvars are full of bhakti of the higher kind only. The extreme doctrine of prapatti or self-surrender underlies their outpourings. They firmly believed in the efficacy of this and believed in the intimate relationship between man and God.

This becomes apparent when the following Tamil stanza is read:- "इऩ्ऱाग नाळैये यागइऩिस सिऱिदुम् निऩ्ऱागनिऩ ऩरुळॆऩबालदे -- नऩ्ऱाग नाऩुऩऩै यऩ्ऱियिलेऩ् कण्डाय् नारणऩे! नी यॆऩ्ऩै यऩऱियिलै ." (नाऩमुगऩ तिरुवन्दादि-७)

"Whether to-day, to-morrow, later on or a long time after, your grace is certainly mine. O Narayana, I very well know that I am not without you and you without me." Nammāzhvār, another Āzhvar, says in his Tiruvaimozhi:- ऎऩ तावियुळ्गलन्द पॆरुनल्लुदविग कैम्माऱु ऎऩदाविदन् दॊऴिन्देऩ इऩिमीळव तॆऩबदुण्डे? ऎऩदावि यावियुम् नी पॊऴिलेऴु मुण्ड वॆन्दाय्! ऎऩदावियार् ? याऩ आर? तनद नी कॊण्डाक्किऩैये.

(२-११-३,४)

"In return for thy great and good gift the mingling of my spirit with Thee-I have entirely yielded up my spirit to Thee" (free translation).

पिऱन्दवाऱुम् वळानदवाऱुम पॆरियबार तम् कैसॆयदु ऐवर्क्कुद तिऱङ्गळ् साट्टियिट्टुच् चॆय्दुबोऩ मायङगळुम् निऱन्दऩूडु पुक्कुऎऩ तावियै निऩ्ऱुनिऩ्ऱु उरुक्कियुण्गिऩ्ऱ इच् चिऱन्दवाऩसुडरे ! उऩ्ऩै यॆऩ ऱुगॊल्?सोवदुमे.

This when freely rendered:- (तिरुवायमॊऴि -V - १०,१)

"Thou splendid light of Heaven, Thou art in my heart melting and consuming my spirit. When shall I become one with Thee." All the Āzhvars when they speak of God view Him as their teacher, father, mother, child or beloved. In most cases the last is the view largely held. Many a critic is of opinion that the use of the symbolism of love is objectionable and wrong. Such a critic has no conception of the higher love and he generally thinks the sensual attraction to be the chief characteristic of love. Higher love as understood and felt by some men and women is certainly far above the level of the love that could be described only as bestial. It cannot be considered as a mere search after new sensations. The reputed women Sītā, Savitri and Damayanti of the Purāṇas are ever remembered and their memories treasured up because their love was of a higher kind. In the higher love the souls of man and woman are attracted and whether they are near each other or separated widely from each other through difficulties, mutual love or attraction is felt by them.

Even death cannot break this link of mutual love.

The Vaishnavite Āzhvārs, when they look upon God as their beloved, are actuated only by the higher aspect of love. All their passions and longings are [[०१९]]
[[१४]]

redirected to God and they feel helpless in the absence of His presence and highly satisfied when he is present. In short when God is absent they have a sense of desolation and in his fellowship they feel joy because of the preciousness of His love. The attachment to God in the case of some Āzhvars is so great that they are indifferent to all else in this world.

Like the Āzhvars a Vaishnavite devotee merely tries to withdraw his desires from the creation, only to centre them on the Creator, i.e., he lifts his desires from earth to heaven. According to Manavala Mahamuni "The pleasure which arises for the ignorant from sense-objects, the same is called bhakti when directed to God; in the case of Nammāzhvār this bhakti has become love for the beautiful Lord, hence for Āzhvars there arises the love type of devotion." Although many of those who use the symbolism of bride and bridegroom are quite free from all traces of the sensual contacts (and so morally impeccable), there are some who misunderstand this symbolism. Sri Vaishnavas can only consider this as being abnormal. As an example it is only necessary to draw attention to what Mr. Chintamani Vaidya says in his book "Epic India." There he writes: "We entirely disbelieve the truth of these stories; no more mischievous though well intentioned misrepresentations have ever sullied the fair name of a great man" (p. ४२२) and he adds further on "it is surely something exasperatingly inconsistent when those who recite Śrī Krshna's Bhagavad Gita should themselves believe that Śrī Krshna indulged in amours with the gopis of Brindavana which in others would at once be set down as deeply irreligious" (p. ४४६) "To this I need add nothing" says Barnett in the preface to his book "The Heart of India". A Sri Vaishnava would say that both Barnett and Mr. Vaidya are evidently thinking only of love as usually understood by ordinary, not spiritual, mortals.

Further, this incident, which evidently alludes to the "Rasakrida" according to the Śrī Bhagavata Purana, occurred when Śrī Krshna was a boy of only ७,८ or १० years of age. It is certainly preposterous to say that Krshna indulged in amours with the gopis of Brindavan at this age. No South Indian Vaishnavite of any learning thinks of this love towards Krshna as of the same nature as the ordinary passion of love as understood by the common people.

Since the Prabandhas or the writings of the Āzhvars were in Tamil, which is the language of the people, they were widely read. So the doctrines inculcated in these writings were clearly understood by the men. These teachings appealed to them better and they became the general property of the people.

From the writings of Āzhvars it is clear that they did not countenance and uphold caste principles in the matter of God and salvation. Any person, endowed with good character and possessing good learning, was considered to be a great man fit to be respected. Even a Brahman by birth may accept as his guru for mere learning any man of any caste provided the guru possesses the necessary culture and character. So to this [[०२०]]

[[१५]]
extent the caste system was disregarded, though not for other purposes. In support of this we may quote two pasurams or stanzas of the Azhvars:- "पऴुदिला वॊऴुगलाऱ्ऱुप् पलसदुब पेदिमार्गळ् ! इऴिगुलत्तवागळेऩुम ऎम्मडियार्ग ळागिल् तॊऴुमिऩीर कॊडुमिऩ् कॊण्मिऩ ऎऩ्ऱु निऩ्ऩोडुमॊगग वऴिबड वरुळिऩय्बोल् मदिळ तिरुवरङ्गत्ताऩे! (तिरुमालै - ४२)

(तॊण्डरडिप्पॊडियाऴवार्)

The above when translated is as follows :- "God in the fort of Srirangam said as follows:-'Oh men! descended from Brahma, who are free from all mistakes and who are well versed in Vedas! People who are my real devotees must be treated with respect by you even if they are of low birth; teach them things that you know and learn from them things that they know; saying thus you seem to have ordained to treat your devotees as your equals and show them respect accordingly." Nammāzhvar also expresses a similar sentiment in his Tiruvaimozhi III-७, ९:- ''कुलन्दाङ्गु जादिगळ् नालिलुम् कीऴिऴिन्दु ऎत्तऩै नलन्दाऩिलाद सण्डाळ सणडाळाग ळागलुम् वलन्दङगु सगगाददण्णल् मणिवण्णऱ् काळॆऩऩुळ् कलन्दार् अडियारदम् अडियार ऎम्ड्टिगळे.

(तिरुवाय्मॊऴि - III -७,९)

"If we descend below the four castes and come to chandaļas who, however lacking in virtue are true worshippers of God who has in his right hand the hakra, their servant's servants are my masters and their feet are mine to worship." Amongst Vaishnava devotees it is possible to quote many examples of men of lower castes being held in great respect. Even amongst the Azhvars, there were men of castes other than Brahman and of even low caste.

Even Ramanuja held similar views. But to add that he admitted into the Brahman caste a large number of people of other castes seems to Sri Vaishnavas to be preposterous and to show absence of an intimate knowledge of Vaishnavism and Vaishnavite Brahmans. To Ramanuja men who believed in Vishnu as the Supreme Being and followed the principles of Vaishnavism were all Vaishnavites and they were all equal in religious views and so are entitled to great respect. But Ramanuja never interfered with the social order and in fact he seems to have upheld and favoured the Varnāśrama Dharma. All men to whatever caste they may belong are entitled to the grace of God but this does not mean that he ignored caste principles.

Sri Vaishnavism is always connected with Ramanuja, at any rate in South India, because Vaishnavism was crystallized and was clearly understood only after him. The Viśisṭādvaita views constitute the central ideas of the Vaishnavites, and though held by many of Ramanuja's predecessors, it is only after the writing of Śrr Bhashya of Ramanuja that people had definite and clear views about God, Soul and [[०२१]]

Matter. To-day every Sri Vaishnava in South India who claims to know something of his religion believes God to be immanent both in this material world and in the spiritual universe. God is to them not merely a mental abstraction remaining aloof from the world looking down upon men as an autocrat. God is conceived by them as existing in soul and matter, and in fact everything is dependent upon Him. In other words Sri Vaishnavas think that God joins them in their experiences of life, shares in their views and works for the upbuilding of the world.

In the succession list of Āchāryas and Āzhvars which every devout Sri Vaishnava remembers, and which is already quoted, the Āzhvars are referred to by only one name, that of Nammazhvar. Of the beings of this world Āzhvars are considered to be the most prominent and greatest and amongst them Nammāzhvār holds a very high place both on account of his personal character and his writings. His writings are more philosophical and contain much of the religious beliefs and treats of everything from a high plane. His writings are believed to be the epitome of the teachings of the Vedas Rg, Yajus and Sama. The Tiruvaimozhi, which is the best known and the most popular of his works, is believed to be the repository of grand truths echoed in the Sama Veda. It is the clearest and most succinct exposition of the eternal truths of the Vedas. It consists of १,१०२ stanzas divided into १० chapters.

Since the writings of the Azhvars and Acharyas have a profound influence on the Vaishnavite movement, it is necessary to take a brief view of the lives, and doings of at least the most important personages amongst them. Of the Azhvars Nammāzhvar may be singled out as a representative of his class.

Nammāzhvār was born at Sri Nagari on the ४३rd day of the present Kaliyuga. He is considered to be the amsam of Vishvaksēna (Senainathan), the leader of the divine hosts.

He was called Maran by his parents, because, as a child, he ate no material such as milk, etc., which are usually given as food to children and yet he maintained his health and grew well He was laid in a cradle tied to a tamarind tree, which is held to be a sacred tree even now. Some of the orthodox Sri Vaishnavas keep along with other materials of worship a bit of the bark of this tamarind tree.

He had not any kind of touch with this world even afterwards. It is generally held that he was endowed with all perfections even from his childhood. Since he was not connected with this world and its affairs, he never knew the ways of the world. Because of his perfection in all ways people think that he should be considered to be superior to all the other Azhvars. He is therefore described as the soul and the other Āzhvars as his body, Bhūtat Āzhvar, Poigai Āzhvar and Peyāzhvar represent his head, eyes and face respectively; his neck and hands are Tirumahisai, Kulaśekhara and Tiruppāṇa Āzhvars respectively; his breasts and navel are Tondaradippodi and Tirumangai Āzhvārs respectively; and the Āzhvar Madurakavi forms his feet.

Namniāzhvār is believed to have seen directly the Lord and thus realized in himself and in the infinite Nature the powers of the Supreme being. He was always anxious to save humanity without distinction of caste, creed or sex. It was this that made him pour [[०२२]]

[[१७]]
forth his religious ideas and views in the language of the people, Tamil, in his Tiruvaimozhi already referred to. He was very short lived, as he died in his ३५th year.

Madurakavi, born at Tirukkoilur who was considered to be the amsam of Kumuda, an angel near God in Vaikuntha, was the shield and shadow of Nammāzhvar. Madurakavi survived his master and lived for ५० years after him. He travelled about widely in South India singing Prabandhams and proclaiming his master's story.
