title = "10 Initiation into Vaishnavism"

+++
As already stated the Sri Vaishnava Brahmans do not differ from the Smārta Brahmans so far as samskāras enjoined by the Sūtras are concerned. But every Sri Vaishnava Brahman has to be initiated into the secrets of the Vaishnavite religion by a [[०४०]]
[[११]]

Vaishnavite religious teacher. This first initiation into Vaishnavism is called the Panchasamskara ceremony. This initiation is usually performed by a grihastha who is learned and well versed in Sastras. It is also done by the sanyasis and mathādhipatis.

The person seeking initiation goes to the religious teacher and after the preliminary prostration and offering of the usual fruits, flowers, betel leaves and nuts requests to be initiated. The initiate should be a Brahmachari, a grihastha and a person who has not passed through the ceremony of Upanayana is not fit for initiation. Though it has become a formal ceremony, it was in former times a living ceremony and the initiate was capable of understanding the importance of the initiation. The frame of mind most essential for the initiation was there.

The person seeking initiation is usually told to come on a particular day fixed by the Acharya, provided he is satisfied with the candidate. In case he is not satisfied, the candidate is asked to wait for a time. The actual ceremony of Panchasamskara consists of the five distinct items tapa, pundra, nama, the mantras and yajana (branding, wearing caste marks, naming, repeating of mantras and worship of God given). As a matter of fact the name of the ceremony Panchasamskara is given to it on account of its consisting of these five items.

The branding or tapa is usually done on the shoulders with chakra mark on the right shoulder and the sankha mark on the left, the chief emblems of Vishnu. (See plate IV-A.) These marks are made of silver or copper and are attached to the ends of sticks of the same metal. For purposes of branding these sticks are heated in a fire in which the sudarśana homam has been performed. If the Acharya is a grihastha (married man), he heats the sticks, after himself doing the homa and brands the initiate. If, on the other hand, the Acharya happens to be a sanyasi, he requests a grihastha to do the sudarśana homam and then receives the heated rods bearing the emblem from him and does the branding. The sanyasins of Vadagalai persuasion cannot touch any metal under any circumstances. So the heated rods are not directly touched. They are covered with betel or plantain or mango leaves and then the covered end is taken hold of by the hand and the branding is then done. Some Acharyas such as those of the Ahobila Mutt and a few Tengalai Acharyas do not consider the sudarśana homam as necessary and so they dispense with it.

The pundra or caste mark is put on in twelve places (hence the name dvādaśapundram) beginning with the forehead. While making these marks in their appropriate places they have to pronounce the mantra pertaining to it or at least the name of one of the twelve. The full details of wearing the dvādaśapundram are described in detail under the daily ceremonies of a Sri Vaishnava Brahman.

The name to be adopted by the person should be that of one of the recognized names of Vishnu. If the name already borne by the initiate corresponds to any one of Vishnu's names, it is recognized and no new name is given, but if otherwise a new name is given. As regards naming of men it is mostly the name of some God that is given and amongst Sri Vaishnavas it is only the name of the God Vishnu. In this connexion it is ५-A [[०४१]]

interesting to note that one of the Āzhvārs insists upon giving to an individual the name of Vishnu and not the names of objects. (cf. Pasurams of Periya Āzhvār Tirumozhi IV).

"माऩिडसादियिल् तोऩऱिऱ्ऱु ओरमाऩिड जादियै माऩिडसादियिऩ पेरिडडाल् मऱुमैक् किल्लै वाऩुडैमादवा! कोविन्दा ! वॆऩ्ऱऴैददक्काल् नाऩुडै नारणऩ् तम्मऩऩै नरगम्बुगाळ." मलमुडै यूत्तैयिल् तोऩ् ऱिऱऱु ओर्मल वूत्तैयै मलमुडै यूत्तैयिऩ पेरिट्टाल् मऱुमैक्किल्लै कुलमुडैक् कोविन्दा ! कोविन्दा ! वॆऩ्ऱऴैददक्काल् नलमुडै नारणऩ तम्मऩऩै नरगमबुगाळ्.

(टॆरियाऴ्वार्दिरुमॊऴि -IV-६, ४, ५)

The above translated into English is as follows:-- (I) If a being who is one of the human kind is called by a name common to the human beings, heaven is not attainable; in case he is called Madhava! Govinda! (which are names of God) the mother of this person who is named after Narayana will not enter (naraka) hell.

(२) If a person whose body consists of a mass of dirt and who is born from another person whose body is also similarly composed is named after a being who is also like the human being in structure, heaven is not attainable; if, on the other hand, he is named Govinda! Govinda! the mother of this person called only by one of Narayana's names, he will not go to hell.

The fourth and most important item is the repetition of the mūla mantra and dvaya mantra into the right ear of the initiate in such a low tone that it could be heard only by the person who undergoes initiation. These mantras are held to be most sacred and very important by all Śrī Vaiṣṇavas.

The fifth item is the presenting of an idol for worshipping This item is only a formal thing in the ceremony now done.

After this ceremony of branding the initiate very often requests to be initiated in the reading of Rāmāyaṇa, Śrī Bhāṣya, etc. These works are not generally to be read without an initiation. The Āchārya utters in the hearing of the candidate the beginning (words which form the commencement) of these works. This is done because no Śrī Vaiṣṇava can begin the reading of any of these without being initiated. From an elaborate real initiation this has now dwindled into an empty formal ceremony. Originally initiation meant, making the candidate catch the real spirit of the work.

To call oneself a Śrī Vaiṣṇava Brahman this initiation is necessary. Even non- Brahmans undergo the ceremony of Pañchasaṁskāra if they are to become Vaiṣṇavas.

Of course in all the twice born castes wearing the sacred thread, initiation takes place only after the performance of the thread-wearing ceremony to the individual concerned.

As already mentioned, during the time of Rāmānuja all Śrī Vaiṣṇava Brahmans observed more or less the same common principles as regards rituals and doctrines. As they had to contend against other religions they all united together and observed the [[०४२]]
same customs and held similar beliefs. This was inevitable as they all had the same Āzhvārs and Āchāryas who all wrote in the same strain. Until several years after the death of Rāmānuja (A.D. ११३७) there were no dissentient voices. But after Rāmānuja's death differences soon arose in interpretations and this led to doctrinal differences and observances. At first the differences were only in philosophical explanations but as time rolled on the differences became larger and larger in number and at last when Pillai Lokacharya and Vedānta Deśika appeared the Sri Vaishnavas became sharply divided into the two sections Tengalais and Vadagalais, the former recognizing Pillai Lokacharya and the latter Vedānta Deśika as their respective teachers. From this time onwards these two sections remain separate and the differences are becoming keener and keener day after day and are becoming more bigoted and losing the spirit of toleration to a very great extent For the sake of clearness the two sections of Vaishnavites will be dealt with separately.
