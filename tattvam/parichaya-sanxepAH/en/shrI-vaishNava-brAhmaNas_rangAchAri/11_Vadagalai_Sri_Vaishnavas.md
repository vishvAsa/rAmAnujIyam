+++
The Vadagalais or the Northerners as the name is sometimes interpreted, recognize Rāmānuja as their chief Āchārya and after him Tirukkuraikāppillai–shortly referred to as Pillan. Subsequent to Pillan there were several recognized as Āchāryas until we come to Vedānta Deśika. Their names and successors are shown below in a tabular form :– Rāmānuja.

Tirukkuraikāi Pillan.

Engal Āzhvan (Vishnu Chithan)

Nadadur Ammal.

(Varada Chariar).

Appullar.

Vedānta Deśika.

After Rāmānuja the Āchārya of eminence and of keen intellect capable of preaching to the world was only Vedānta Deśika. Like Rāmānuja he was a reformer of a very high order and a universal teacher in virtue of his versatile intellect As long as Rāmānuja was alive, Sri Vaishnavas attached equal importance to the religious views expressed both in Sanskrit and Tamil writings. To Rāmānuja and his followers during his lifetime the Vedas written in Sanskrit along with the other Śāstras also written in the Sanskrit language and the Tamil Prabandhams with the commentaries in Tamil called "The Six Thousand" were equal in sanctity. Both were held in high estimation. Soon after Rāmānuja's death certain Āchāryas took more kindly to the Tamil Prabandhams than to the Sanskrit Vedas and Śastras. This was natural because Tamil [[०४३]]
[[३८]]

(G.S., being their own mother-tongue, Tamil writings appealed to their minds with greater force than a foreign language like Sanskrit. Great intellectual effort was needed to master the Sanskrit language so as to be able to understand thoroughly the views expressed in Sanskrit religious works. The followers of such Acharyas began to pay exclusive attention to the Prabandhams and Tamil commentaries on the same, and totally neglected the Sanskrit writings. The followers of such Acharyas became crystallized as the Tengalai sect of the present day. While some Acharyas showed a greater inclination to the study of Tamil Prabandhams alone, others continued like Ramanuja to consider both the Tamil Prabandhams and the Sanskrit Vedas and Sastras as equally good and the followers of such Acharyas are now known as the Vadagalai sect.

The Viśishṭadvaita philosophy so ably developed by Ramanuja in his commentaries on the Brahma Sutras usually called "The Śri Bhashya" was promulgated by all the teachers that followed Ramanuja until Vedānta Dēśika. It was left to Vedanta Deśika once again to preach and promulgate this philosophy to its fullest extent and resuscitate it from its decadence. The Vadagalai Sri Vaishnavas of the present time adopt practically the tenets as promulgated by Vedanta Deśika. To understand the influence of this great soul it is necessary to speak about this universal teacher and his doings.

Vedanta Deśika was born at Tuppil (at present a part of Conjeeveram town) in the year १२६९ A.D. Ananta Sūri his father was a devout Sri Vaishnava who had performed a yaga Hence he was called Ananta Sūri Somayāji. He was the descendant of one of the seventy-four simhasanādhipatis established by Ramanuja. Vedanta Deśika's mother Thotharambha was the sister of Atreya Ramanuja, better known as Appullar, the successor of Nadadur Ammal (Varada Chariar) as the Ubhayasimhāsanādhipati. Vedanta Deśika lived for १०० years. He died in the year १३६९ A D (१४th November १३६९)

As already stated, amongst the Acharyas that came after Rāmānuja, Vedanta Deśika is considered to be the greatest and in many respects equal to Ramanuja. Just like Ramanuja, Vedanta Desika had to establish once again the Viśishţadvaita philosophy and thus prove the supremacy of Vaishnavism over other religious beliefs especially Advaitism This was his chief aim To do this successfully he had to promulgate the Visishṭādvaita philosophy and teach the tenets in such a way as to appeal to the people in general. The difficulties he had to overcome were greater than those Ramanuja encountered. The latter reformer had only to deal with the Advaitism of Sankara, but the former had to contend not only against Advaitism but also against Jainism.

After Ramanuja's death Jainism gained ground and gradually began to spread amongst the masses. At the time when Vedanta Deśika began his religious teachings these religions had attained great prominence. Further in many respects the period in which Vedanta Deśika flourished was a most momentous and troublesome one in South India.

Just then the Mahomedans had penetrated South India. Their fanaticism, crusading spirit against other religions and their discipline enabled them to become irresistible.

The people of the country, being in a weakened condition, could not withstand the struggle with other religions. So they were looking on with despair at all the desecrations [[०४४]]
of their temples and religion. Just at this juncture the two great men Vedanta Deśika and Vidyaranya appeared on the scene and successfully maintained their religions Vaishnavism and Saivism respectively. In opposing the spread of other religions both these men were interested and so both of them united in stemming the progress of other religions. Their organizing genius, faith and patience enabled them to restore the faith of the panic-stricken people in their own religion and to bring about its triumph over other religions in this part of India.

No doubt all the Srivaishnavas, both the Vadagalais and the Tengalais followed the Viśishtadvaita philosophy. As the Tengalais adopted mainly Prabandhams to the exclusion of Sanskrit they were unable to maintain this philosophy in the face of the development of other Hindu religions and Muhammadanism. So Vedanta Deśika (also named Venkatanatha) had to contend against the Tengalar views and Śaivism.

Vedanta Dēśika continued the work of Ramanuja and his position was a peculiar one.

He joined hands with Vidyaranya, a worthy rival who continued the work of Sankara Acharya, in opposing the spread of other religions. As both Deśika and Vidyaranya were men of extraordinary intellect and encyclopædic knowledge and as they both disliked the spread of other religions equally, they preached and worked to establish the faith of the Hindus. Vedanta Dēśika upheld his own view of the Viśishtadvaita philosophy against the Tengalais and against Advaitism Judging from Vedanta Deśika's writings, which are about १२० in number, his activity was many-sided. Possessing a versatile intellect, it was possible for him to make his teachings thorough. So far as his daily life was concerned he was extremely kind, sincerely pious, and his habits were saintly though simple. His name is revered by posterity because he was not only the embodiment of everything that was good and great, but also for his deep erudition and sterling virtues as man By rescuing from degradation he rendered valuable services to Vaishnavism at the most critical period.

It would not be an exaggeration if people told that no saint ever lived in more critical times and no one overcame the difficulties with such success and glory.

Vedanta Deśika possessed an extraordinary power of rousing the religious spirit in human minds. His writings have appealed and moulded the minds of many and in several directions. He wrote both in Tamil and Sanskrit and like Ramanuja he held both the languages equal and treated the Prabandhams and Vedas and Sastras with the same respect and regard. The subject-matter of his writings is as varied as his intellect.

He wrote to the satisfaction of poet, saint, philosopher and the ordinary level of human beings. In fact his writings appealed to and appeased all kinds and grades of men.

Added to this the intellectual feat of his life presented to the world a model of saintly simplicity and divine purity. In the matter of devotion to God, he was the foremost and unique. He has rendered the greatest possible service to the humanity by the purity of his devotion to God. So it is no wonder that his own people loved him very much, that he was a terror to his enemies and that he was admired by both.

४० Bulletin, Madras Government Museum. [G.S., His literary greatness is well-known to scholars and it was acknowledged even by Advaitins. Appayya Dikshitar, an orthodox Brahmin and an Advaitin of a high order, has written a commentary called Deśika's Yadavabhyudayam on one of Vedanta Deśika's works.

Vedanta Deśika was a grihastha throughout his life and never adopted the sanyasi's life. Thus he proved to the world that it is not necessary to be a sanyasi for being an Acharya and to do religious and propagandist work. He successfully showed to the world that a householder's life is also as dignified as that of a sanyasi and that it is well suited for the attainment of moksha. All his teachings were done in the very homes of men who were desirous of knowledge No one had to seek the Acharya in a secluded place. Consequently religious instruction spread widely and rapidly. The mode of teaching adopted by him led to the marvellous increase of scholars to hear him and the Viśishtadvaitic philosophic ideas thereby became more general and popular.

This great person is considered to be a great saint and he is not only worshipped in the form of an idol, but is also ever remembered by Sri Vaishnavas of the Vadagalai persuasion. Whenever they do their domestic worship of God they never fail to invoke this great saint's blessings and pray that he may be with them and shed his wholesome influence on their character and life "for a century more" referring of course to his period of existence in this world. As the prayer is repeated almost everyday by the Vadagalai Sri Vaishnavas, it may be said that Vadagalai Sri Vaishnavas are praying indirectly for his eternal presence. It is also a custom amongst the Vadagalai Brahmans to offer holy offerings in the form of betel, fruits and money to Vedanta Deśika during every ceremony.

Being a strict follower of Ramanuja he promulgated Ramanuja's ideas of God, soul and matter in a more elaborate form as religious treatises and lectures. All his lectures are now collected together and are called Rahasyams as they contain views about tatvas and God Most of these lectures were delivered to a mixed audience and in a mixed language called "Manipravāļam." It is probable that his audience were well versed in this mixed language-Tamil interspersed with Sanskrit-during his days.

With Ramanuja, he held that God is a perfect personality endowed with all good qualities, and quite independent of everything in this universe. He is unique, supreme and second to none. God is the influencer and supporter of everything around him.

Although in the created world there are different things, they are all permeated by the spirit of God. In other words, God's connexion with the things in the universe is perfectly natural. The supreme being in addition to his spirit permeating every thing, has also a special divine form called "Nitya Vibhuti." In this peculiar state neither prakriti nor karma could touch him. Although the supreme being is immanent, He is not touched by the changes occurring in matter (prakriti) nor by the sufferings of the soul.

All evil is the result of past wrong and it is due to the soul's embodied life, i.e., life in samsara. God is in no way responsible for it. He has made laws for guidance [[०४६]]
[[४१]]
and he does not interfere with these regular laws Souls and matter exist because of him and are subject to his will in spite of their being real and eternal.

In all his lectures Vedanta Deśika deals with the characteristics of the tatvas including God: prominence is given to Prapatti and in his lectures collected together under the special name of "Rahasya trayasaram" he gives a detailed account of the character, power and qualities of God, and the qualifications necessary to attain to moksha through the method of Prapatti. In all his lectures called "Rahasyams" he deals with the three tatvas and with the three mantrams or Rahasya mantras pertaining to Narayana, the Supreme Being. In all these lectures he speaks of the same items, but from different points of view in each. As an example, the ideas expressed in one of these lectures (called Rahasyams) on tatvams are given below :- The tatvas that ought to be clearly understood, by good and pious men initiated by good Acharyas into the mūla mantras, are two, namely, Paratatva and Aparatatva.

Of these two the Paratatva is Sriyappati, the Purushottama (the Supreme Being).

He is the seed or source of everything that can be thought of; he permeates everything and exists in them just as life exists in the body of living beings; he is unfathomable, the Great Light, the Great Deva; he is the receptacle of wonderful qualities and possessor of the most exalted and unopposable good qualities; he is without an equal in goodness; he is capable of enjoyment without any hindrance from any source and is the possessor of all auspicious qualities; he, in order to prevent those who throw on his mercy from being born several times, assumes avatars by being born in several forms; he does this to prevent those who believe in him fully from undergoing troubles by birth and in so doing he subjects himself seemingly to the sufferings incidental to such lives; he does good to the devas according to their merits; and evil to the asuras who think of doing evil; those who trust him as their innermost soul are trusted by him as his soul; he throws himself completely on those who surrender themselves to him unconditionally and entirely. He is also capable of existing in two Vibūtis, १.e., both in Heaven and in this world, as stated by some Āzhvars - He is without a second as his equal; he is a wonderful being capable of existing in five forms, namely, Para, Vyūha, Vibhava, Antaryamisvarūpa and Archāvatāram.

In Para rūpa he as a single form will be visible only to Muktas and Nityas; कुऴुमिऱ् ऱॆवा कुऴाङ्गळ कैदॊऴ्च् चोदिवॆळ ळत्तिऩुळळे ऎऩ्ऱुम् आदियञ् जोगयुरु वॆऩऱुम सॊल्लुगिऱ पडिये वाऩुयरिऩबम् मऩऩु वीऱ्ऱिरुन्द रुबम् Translation:-"That form which remains high in the sky giving pleasure to all the beholders, the form remaining surrounded by the effulgent light emanating from it and the one in whose light emanations the worshipping men are standing with hands in a prayerful posture." Vyūhas are rupas that have colours that are changing during Krita and Treta yugams.

The Rupas Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Sankarshaṇa possessing the qualities, śakti, tējas, ६
[[०४७]]
aiswarya, virya, jñana and balam. In disposing of and creating both these would be the qualities possessed by these.

In the four Vyuhas each is divided into three Vyuhantaras and so there will be twelve Vyuhantaras named Kesava, Damodara, etc. (twelve names).

Vibhavams are the avatars of fish, tortoise, etc. These forms are the avatars taken by God.

Antaryami Swarupa is a form that can be seen only in the yogic state (i.e., when eyes become red).

Archavatāram is a form that is conceived by men or devotees, form that is named by the men-devotee, that name-according to the views held by archakas, i.e., Sesha seshibhava established by him.

These rupas will be śubha aśrayams. He who has seen Śrīman will not see one Being without Śrī.

That which is known as the Śarira tatvam of one who is the highest spirit and named Aparatatvam may be divided into chetana and achetana tatvams.
