The soul is as much a reality as God himself. It is quite distinct from Brahmanand it exists from all eternity and it cannot lose its distinction for all time. If it were to cease to be distinct at any time, its very existence would be ended and it cannot become absorbed and become one with Brahman. It is preposterous to find one substance passing over into the nature of another substance and consequently the individual soul and the highest self cannot enter into real union. If the soul is not capable of separate existence then seeking of release from bondage has no meaning and striving for moksha is useless.

The soul is an independent agent in one sense The essential feature of jīva (soul)

is the consciousness of self It retains its character of knowing even in its embodied state. Even though it is made to pass through the process of birth and death several times, it maintains its identity all through. But the power of knowledge, which is its essential feature, becomes contracted when under bondage and expanded in the state of release.

The soul is undoubtedly different from the body, the senses, the vital breath and even buddhi. In the human plane it is merely attached to the gross body which has the five senses and vital breath as its instruments.

Though the soul is endowed with an individuality of a kind, it should be considered at the same time as a part of Brahman. Inasmuch as the soul is an inhabitant of the universe it exists in God. We should remember that God being an inner ruler he also dwells in the soul. As a matter of fact he is in all conscious beings and as such they are thus "qualified" forms of Brahman. The qualifying element (Viseshana) is found [[०३६]]

[[३१]]

in the limiting conditions attached to the successive births in the samsara. The soul, therefore, cannot exist apart from God. So souls are regarded as the effects of Brahman.

But the change effected in the soul relates only to the contraction and expansion of knowledge and so it is not a change of state in the essential nature as is the case with ether, etc.

When we say that the soul is intrinsically a part of Brahman, we must remember that it is no portion cut out from the whole into separate independence for Brahman admits of no division. The individual soul or jīva is no doubt comprised within the supreme self and at the same time it differs from the most high and so is distinct in one sense.

Souls are found embodied and their energy is certainly inferior to that of Brahman or Vishnu. "The souls cannot escape the consequences of their past lives, and they are again thrust into the world at the new creation with appropriate endowments. The souls are of necessity attached to bodies until release."

The embodiment of the soul is, as already stated, due to being engrossed by karma in the form of good and evil works.

Jiva is atomic in form. "The atomic jīva has his seat in the hritpadma. In spite of the atomic size of the jīva through its attribute of knowledge which expands and contracts, it is able to feel pleasure and pain all over the body, even as the flame of the lamp, though tiny in itself, illumines many things by means of its light which is capable of contraction and expansion. It can apprehend objects far away in space and remote in time. The cognition of the souls, as in the case of God, is eternal in character, selfsustained, extends over all things and is valid; albeit its range is narrowed on account of defects such as the past karma and the like. The plurality of souls is evident from the distribution of pleasures and pains. Until liberation, they are bound to prakriti, which serves as a vehicle (Vahana) to the jīva, even as a horse does to the rider. The bondage to the body, "This muddy vesture of decay" obstructs the vision of the eternal and prevents the soul from recognizing its kinship with God." (Radhakrishnan-Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, page ६९१.)

"Thus the self also, although dwelling in one part of the body only, is conscious of sensations taking place in any part of the body." (S.B.E.—४८th vol.—Thibaut, page ५४८.)

"Just as a lamp, although abiding in one place only, enters through the light proceeding from it into connexion with many places; so the soul also, although limited to one place, may through its light-like consciousness enter into several bodies. It may do this as well as in this life the soul, although abiding in one spot of the body only, viz., the heart, pervade the whole body by means of its consciousness and thus makes it its own.

There is, however, the following difference between the two cases. The non-released soul has its intellectual power contracted by the influence of karma, and hence is not capable of that expansive pervasion without which it cannot identify itself with other bodies. The released soul, on the other hand, whose intellectual power is non-contracted [[०३७]]
[[३२]]

is capable of extending as far it likes, and thus to make many bodies its own." (S.BE., Thibaut, Vol. ४८, p. ७६५.)

When freed from the body the souls go to heaven regain their innocence and face God. In this heaven, God abides in his wonderful divine form possessing the charm of eternal youth. In the released state souls are in the satva form. "This ideal world is inherent in God. It is a state already individualized. This condition cannot be identified with the state of souls and matter in pralaya. Apart from the world body, İsvara has an ideal materiality, a sort of plastic stuff, through which he displays his boundless power of appearing diverse and multiple, though he is inwardly one and the same. Yet his essence is to be distinguished from this Nitya Vibhūti also." (Radhakrishnan-Indian Philosophy, Vol. २, p. ६८६.)

"All evil is the issue of past wrong. It is the product of the soul's life in the samsāra, the fruit of its own act. For this God is in no way responsible. Above the endless succession of existences he dwells in light where no shadow of wrong can dim his glory.

Such life is even possible from embodied spirits in the world above; how much more then for the Most High Self." (S.B.E., Vol. ४८, p. ६४८.)

"So scripture testifies with the utmost emphasis that Brahman 'free from evil, from old age, from grief'." (SB.E, Vol ४८, p ६०८.)

Moksha or salvation is understood by Ramanuja and his followers in South India to be the release of the soul from its bondage or samsara (limiting barriers) Ramanuja does not accept the theory of complete absorption of soul into the absolute. Though the released soul may attain the nature of God, there will always be an Almighty Power above him to worship and to adore. In the released state all souls are alike "Of him who has freed himself from his ordinary name and form, and all the distinctions found thereon, and has assumed the uniform character of intelligence, it may be said that he is of the character of Brahman." (SB.E., Vol. ४८, p. १००)

Although the released souls keep up their individuality, or the character of Brahman, they do not attain identity with God. Like God they are atomic in size, but they cannot permeate everything and thus be all-pervading It is true that souls can enter into several bodies and experience different worlds created by the Lord, but they are not capable of creating these worlds. The work of creation is the exclusive characteristic of God. In the Bhagavat Gitā it is said that the released soul attains only the same attributes as the Highest Self. "Abiding by this knowledge, they, attaining, to an equality of attributes with me, do neither come forth at the time of creation nor are troubled at the time of general destruction." (Bhag. Gita, XIV, २.)

"Intelligence, therefore, bliss, and the other essential qualities of the soul which were obscured and compacted by karma, expand and thus manifest themselves when the bondage due to karma and the soul approaches the highest light." (SB.E., Vol. ४८, p. ७५८)

"Where the texts speak of the soul's becoming equal to, or having equal attributes with, Brahman the meaning is that the nature of the individual soul which is a mere [[०३८]]

[[३३]]
mode of Brahman is equal to that of Brahman, i.e., that on putting off its body it becomes equal to Brahman in purity. The soul when it has reached the highest light and freed itself from all bondage, is conscious of itself as separate from the highest self" (S.B.E, Vol. ४८, pp. ७५८ and ७५९)

"Śruti and Smriti alike declare that the connexion of the individual souls with bodies of different kinds-divine, human, animal and so on-depends upon the karma of those souls; compare 'He who performs good works becomes good, he who performs bad works becomes bad. He becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds.' In the same way the reverend Parāśara declares that what causes the difference in nature and status between Gods, men, and so on, is the power of the former deeds of the souls about to enter into a new creation. 'He (the Lord) is the operative cause only in the creation of new beings; the material cause is constituted by the potentialities of the beings to be created. The being to be embodied requires nothing but an operative cause; it is its own potentiality which leads its being into that condition of being (which it is to occupy in the new creation)'. Potentiality here means karma." (S.B.E, Vol. ४८, p. ४७८.)
