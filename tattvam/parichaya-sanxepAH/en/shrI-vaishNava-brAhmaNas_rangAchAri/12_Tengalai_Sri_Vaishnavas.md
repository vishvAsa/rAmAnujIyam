title = "12 Tengalai Sri Vaishnavas"

+++
Like the Vadagalai Sri Vaishnavas the Tengalai Sri Vaishnavas also have their own hierarchy of Acharyas and they are represented in a tabular form below :--

Ramanuja  
Embar (१०२४-११२९ A.D.)  
Bhattar (Parasara Bhattar) (१०६२-१०९० A.D.)  
Nanjlyar (१११२-१२१३ A.D.)  
Nampillai (१२०७-१३०२ A.D.)  
Periyaachchan Pillai (१२२६-१३२१)  
Pillai Lokacharya (१२६४-१३२७)  
Vadakku Tiruvidippillai (१२२६- ?)  
[[०४८]]

The Acharyas usually recognized by the Tengalai Brahmans are all included in the above hierarchy. But when we take into consideration the dates of their birth and death, there arises some confusion. For instance in the table given above we find Embar as the successor of Ramanuja. Ramanuja and Embar are Tirumalai Nambi's sister's sons, and Tirumalai Nambi was the preceptor of both Ramanuja and Embar. According to the tradition amongst Vadagalais, Embar could not have succeeded Ramanuja, as Embar died seven years before Ramanuja's death. Embar died in ११३० A.D. Both Embar and Ramanuja were students studying under Yadavaprakāśa. After Embar comes Parāśara Bhatta, Kūrēśa's son. In this case also the succession is doubted. Parāśara Bhatta is said to be born in १०६२ A.D. (४१६३ Kaliyuga) and to have lived only २८ years. So he must have died in १०९० A.D, ie, about ३९ years before Embar and ४९ years before the death of Ramanuja. Under these circumstances it is considered impossible that Paraśara Bhatta succeeded Embar Both Paraśara Bhatta and his younger brother Vedavyāsa Bhatta were the disciples of their father Kūrēśa.

The successors of Ramanuja, Embar and Paraśara Bhatta were never celebrated as being well-versed in Prabandhams. On the other hand they were good Sanskrit scholars and their works in Sanskrit are free from partisan spirit and are accepted by all (१.e., both by Vadagalais and Tengalais)

Here it should be remarked that Bhatta was the name given to more than one person.

The younger Bhatta (Vedavyasa Bhatta) was really a cleverer person than his brother, Paraśara Bhatta.

Nanjiyar who succeeded Bhatţa (Parāśara Bhatta) is said to be a Madhva by caste and he was converted into Vaishnavism by Bhatta (Paraśara Bhatta). The name Nanjīyar was adopted only after becoming a Vaishnavite sanyasi.

Nampillai succeeded Nanjīyar. He wrote the ९,००० again (५) after the loss of the same in the Cauvery. His period was an epoch-making one for the Tengalais, because it was he who paved the way for sectarianism amongst the Vaishnavites.

The Ubhaya Simhasanādhipati Varadachariar left finally Srirangam and went back to Conjeeveram. This enabled Nampillai to freely promulgate his views with energy, as there was no one to oppose him.

Just as in the case of Bhatta there were two persons known by the name Nanjiyar.

The person who wrote commentaries on the ९,००० (२) on the Prabandhas was a disciple of Kadambi Achchan. There was also another sanyasi known as Nanjīyar, a disciple of Vedavyāsa Bhatta. Evidently the author of the Tengalai guruparamparai, Pinbalagiya Jiyar, confounded this person with the Nanjiyar of the ९,००० of the Prabandhic fame and thus confusion arose.

Nampillai's lectures drew to him several learned men and Periya Achchan Pillai was one of his disciples. "Periya Achchan attended the lectures of his master Nampillai and published the lectures on Prabandham as the २४,००० (२४). In spite of the popularity of his lectures and views, it was absolutely necessary to show that these views were based upon the traditional account, based upon the teachings of the Acharyas.

६-A [[०४९]]
[[४४]]

Without this basis people may not accept the views and follow the tenets without demur. As Nampillai made much of the fact that caste was nothing before creed and as he taught that Prabandhams in Tamil were superior to Sanskrit writings, his teachings appealed to the masses very much. An Acharyic hierarchy had to be prepared to show to the people that there was really a continuity of teaching through the Acharyas. Consequently a Guruparampara was prepared and written by Pinbalagiya Perumal Jiyar.

The Tengalai Guruparamparat did not fully follow the tradition. Some facts were ignored and certain facts were suppressed, as they were not found necessary for the purpose.

As already stated Ramanuja strove hard to establish Vaishnavism by harmonizing and co-ordinating all the previous works. No distinction was made between the Sanskrit teachings and the Tamil Prabandhams. He considered the Tamil Prabandhams and the Sanskrit Vedas to be equal in every respect. Soon after Ramanuja's death this balance of judgment gradually weakened and finally disappeared. One set of Acharyas began to propound the Prabandhams to be all important, ignoring the study of Sanskrit writings. As a reaction, in opposition to this view, some Acharyas insisted upon Sanskrit being studied more than the Prabandhams, though they did not ignore the Prabandhams completely.

Gradually the attachment to the Tamil Prabandhams became so great that Sanskrit was completely neglected. This was both good and bad at the same time. It was good because this movement enabled everybody to become acquainted with religious truths irrespective of caste. The religious truths and culture were till now the monopoly of the people who naturally read Sanskrit, and these were confined to the higher castes. The lower castes who constituted the mass being unable to follow the culture in Sanskrit, read and understood very well all the truths contained in the Tamil writings. The Prabhandic movement of the Tengalais thus led to the rapid spread of Vaishnavism among all grades of people and it became a popular creed. As a logical result of this movement several Non-Brahman castes, such as the Vanniyans, began to claim superiority, or at any rate, equality with the Sri Vaishnava Brahmans. This view was carried to such an extreme that certain Vanniyans took to the sacred thread, to the study of the Vedas and even to the establishment of temples and temple worship. Such a group of Vanniyans exists in Kumilam village in South Arcot District. (See "Castes and Tribes " under Pallis.) These people call themselves Kovilar. (See plate XII-A & B.) So far, they have remained isolated and no mixture with Sri Vaishnava Brahmans has been effected. In spite of the theoretical views expressed by the Tengalai Brahmans, they have not mixed with them in any way. Like the Vadagalais they have kept aloof from the Kovilar.

Along with the linguistic separation into Prabandhic school and Sanskrit school with Bhashya and Vedas, some doctrinal differences also came in. They relate chiefly to Śrī or Lakshmi and Prapatti.

Śrī or Lakshini is, as already explained, believed by Vadagalais to be with God in all states and endowed with all the powers possessed by God. So she has [[०५०]]
"Vibhutvam", i.e., she is equal to God in every respect, inasmuch as she possesses the same powers as God. But according to the views of the Tengalais Śri or Lakshmi is only one of the Jīvakōṭis and cannot be considered as possessing Vibhutvam. In other words she is like a finite being, but she is at the head of all. She is only a servant of God though her soul is superior to the souls of others. She is even superior to Vishvaksēna, but only of his class, i.e., "Aparam" only. She can and may plead with God on our behalf, but she has no power to give moksha to anybody.

Vadagalais consider Śrī or Lakshmi to be equal to God in every respect and she possesses Vibhutvam as stated above. They consider her to be always one with the Lord and to co-operate with him in the maintenance and preservation of this universe.

Therefore she is as important as God in the determination and regulation of everything in our life.

Both the Vadagalais and Tengalais believe in "Bhakti" and "Śaraṇāgati". But however, most of the Tengalais, especially those who belong to the Prabandhic school, hold that the Āzhvārs gave prominence to Śaraṇāgati (prapatti) in preference to Bhakti preceded by the strict performance of duties and by the acquisition of the knowledge of God (Jñāna). Śaraṇāgati or prapatti, according to the Āhvārs, depends only upon the Grace of God and no preliminary effort is needed. The Vadagalais and a few Tengalais also hold that Ramanuja showed that both bhakti and Saranagati were methods of obtaining salvation according to the Upanishads and Vedanta. While Ramanuja was alive, and until some time after his death no difference of opinion as regards the method of preparation of a prapanna and the circumstances under which he could practise prapatti was held. Both the Vadagalais and Tengalais are agreed as to the need for prapatti, but the Tengalais say that mere surrender to God is enough. Self-effort or other kinds of preparation are considered unnecessary for self-surrender. God's love is spontaneous and so previous preparation is not needed This theory of Saranagati logically leads to the idea of "Dōsha bhōgya" by God. The Vadagalais, on the other hand, hold that selfeffort and a great deal of preliminary effort is needed to create a feeling of complete helplessness and unalloyed faith in God's grace. So, as a preliminary to prapatti (Saraṇagati) a great deal of preparation is necessary. Vedānta Dēśika in all his lectures shows the importance and the necessity of the previous preparation. No doubt that God's love is always available and he is also generous enough to ignore the soul's taints when prayed for.

In accordance with the above views the Tengalais do not submit themselves to the ceremony of prapatti after Panchasaṁskāra, whilst the Vadagalais seek an Acharya and request him to help them to perform the prapatti (Śaraṇāgati) as a separate item, after the Panchasaṁskāra. The Panchasaṁskāra ceremony may be performed even when the candidate has not passed through the Upanayanam When the candidate is in a precarious state of health, or is very eager on account of some other reason, this ceremony may be performed.

Both the Vadagalais and the Tengalais hold that for prapatti any person of any caste is qualified. If a person of a non-Brahman caste becomes a prapanna, he is considered to [[०५१]]
[[४६]]

be equal to an orthodox Brahman prapanna in every respect by the Tengalai Brahmans.

"A prapanna is, therefore, above the ordinary run of humanity, and in consequence he need not observe the rules of the caste (Varnaśramadharma). He may, if he chooses, observe these dharmas for the sake of convention." But the Vadagalais say that in the case of a non-Brahman prapanna respect must be shown as a prapanna Sri Vaishnava, but socially creed cannot supersede caste and caste can be extinguished only with death. However holy and pious a man may be, he cannot free himself, during his lifetime from the duties of his caste. Caste, however, does not stand in his way of getting moksha, which he obtains from his dependence on God. The observance of Varnaāśramadharma is an absolute necessity. Non-observance leads to social degradation and spiritual bankruptcy.

During the initiation and prapatti the Vadagalais hold that in the case of women and Non-Brahmans the "Pranava" of the "Mūlamantra" should not be pronounced and that in its stead the syllable "Am" is to be substituted. The Tengalais, on the other hand, hold that the Pranava may be pronounced by all irrespective of caste. In accordance with this view of equality spiritual knowledge can be obtained even from a teacher of a lower caste. This, however, is not followed by the Vadagalais under any circumstances.

It is not known if the Tengalai Brahmans have ever adopted the teachings from a non-Brahman Tengalai. As far as Tengalais are concerned, they have not as yet sought upadeśa from any non-Brahman Tengalai Vaishnavite.

A sanyasi of the Vadagalai sect has to lead a life which is more rigorous than that of a householder. He is considered to be more holy than an ordinary grihastha. So he cannot do obeisance to a grihastha, unless he happens to be the Sanyasi's own Acharya. He is not to touch any metallic vessel and he is expected to live only by accepting meals offered to him by orthodox Sri Vaishnava Brahmans. He should not take food from the hands of anybody indiscriminately.

According to the "Tengalais a Tengalai sanyasi pays and receives obeisance even from a householder. He need not beg his food, and he is allowed the use of metallic vessels of all kinds.

Between these two communities there are other small differences in their rituals and ceremonies and also in their social customs. They are discussed below.

In the domestic worship of God, Vadagalais make use of a bell, while the Tengalais do not use it. During worship, prayers both in Tamil and Sanskrit are freely used, but Sanskrit predominates amongst the Vadagalais and Tamil predominates in the case of Tengalais.

In the matter of the performance of the annual śraddha ceremony of any person, if it falls on an Ekadasi day, Tengalais do not perform it on that day. It is done on the next day. Vadagalais, on the other hand, hold that the postponement of the day of death is not permissible and so it is celebrated on the Ekādaśi day only, if it falls on that day.

When a person is under pollution of any kind, the ceremony of śraddha is performed only on the day on which the pollution ceases.

[[०५२]]

[[४७]]
On the day of the śraddha food is offered to God in the first place and to the Nityas and Acharyas in the second place, and then to the Brahmans representing the pitrdēvatas, etc., by the Tengalais. On the other hand, the Vadagalais offer the food to God only and not the Nityas and Acharyas.

Water touched even accidentally by the feet of the Bhagavatas becomes holy and it is purificatory according to the Tengalais. The Vadagalais maintain that the Śrīpādatīrtha to be purificatory should be secured from the Bhagavatas with the proper ceremonial. One necessary condition is the securing of the will of the Bhagavatas.

Coming to the social custom there are several differences. The Tengalai women do not shave their heads when they become widows. But the Vadagalai widows, like the Smarta Brahman widows, remove the hair from their heads. Some Tengalan women tie their saris so as to have the one end passing over the right shoulder and covering it, whilst the Vadagalai women throw it on their left shoulder.

In the matter of obeisance the Tengalais do it only once. Mutual prostrations, irrespective of age is allowed. Both the disciple and the guru prostrate. They prostrate even to a woman. But among the Vadagalais prostrating to men older than themselves alone is observed. Only very old people observe the returning of prostration and it is never done in the case of young people when they prostrate adopting the prapatti.

Reference may be made to Anga panchaka as developed by Vedanta Deśika for the views held by the Vadagalais (cf. Anga panchaka of the Tengalais by-Manavala Mahamunigal-see Govindachariar's translation).

Tengalais hold that the hearing of the divya mantra during Panchasamskāra, may be considered to be prapatti, and so prapatti need not be done later. Further, they hold that Ramanuja did Śaranagati for all Vaishnavas connected with him and as we are all his followers no prapatti need separately be adopted.

Vadagalais contend that what Ramanuja did could apply only to those who were living with him during his life-time; but those who came into this world after Ramanuja cannot be brought under the Saranagati done by Ramanuja. Every Jiva must do prapatti before or after Panchasamskāra, when he becomes fit for Prapatti or Saranagati He must be an akinchana and this is an essential condition for prapatti.

Tengalais hold that jñānōpadēśa can be obtained from a teacher of any caste. The Vadagalais do not deny the fact. When a disciple prostrates before his guru, the guru should not return it by prostrating himself. In temples God alone is entitled for it and neither a Sanyasi nor a grihastha is entitled for it so long as he stays in the temple Śishyas do not prostrate before God when they go with their Acharya to a temple.

Amongst the Vadagalais, in the case of women, only mothers, elder sisters and Acharya's wives may be shown respect by prostration. In the case of other women respect need not be shown by prostration amongst the Vadagalais.

Prapatti, the Tengalais say, is only a knowledge of śēṣhatvam. The Vadagalais hold that a mere knowledge of śēshatvam does not constitute prapatti. Along with this knowledge bhārasamarpaṇam is essential for Prapatti or Saranagati.

[[०५३]]
[[४८]]

Effort and previous preparation is unnecessary as God's grace is "Nirhētuka" (one without cause). But the Vadagalais contend that although grace is "Nirhētuka" and that they should also do something to obtain it and this something is prapatti.

Tengalais think that no angas are needed for prapatti, although they may adopt it. According to the Vadagalais angas are particularly necessary and for that teachers of any caste can be engaged, but only for ordinary lore. For initiation into Brahma Vidya and mantras, only a Brahman teacher is empowered to do it. For example, when Ramanuja tried to get spiritual knowledge from Tirukacchinambi of Conjeeveram, he refused to be his Acharya or preceptor on the ground that he was not a Brahman.

Tengalais often say that Nathamunigal was initiated by a Non-Brahman Acharya Sathakopa. But the Vadagalais contend that the initiation was done in yoga daśai in which state no question of caste can arise. It is only when initiation is done by a human being directly that it is objectionable. Madura Kavi is quoted by the Tengalais as having adopted as his master a Śūdra and so caste must go. But the Vadagalais hold that mantras with Vidya were not given to Madura Kavi and so the knowledge obtained from his non-Brahman priest was only ordinary knowledge.

The Tengalais consider theoretically that a Vaishnavite of non-Brahman caste also is qualified to initiate a Brahman. But in practice amongst the Tengalai Brahmans there is not even a single instance of a Brahman being initiated by a non-Brahman Vaishnavite. Both Vadagalais and Tengalais are being initiated only by Brahman Vaishnavites at the present day.

Amongst the Tengalais some are swayamāchāryapurushas, while others are followers of Mathādhipatis. Vanamāmalai matham is one of the most important of the mathams and it is under the management of "Vanamamalai Jiyar" The Jiyar is selected by the śishyas (see Plates-I-B, II-A) The plate II-B shows the successors to the priesthood from the earliest to the present time. The present Jiyarswami is seen in plate III-A and B. In plate IV-B is shown a Tengalai Sri Vaishnava who does not belong to Vanamāmalai matham.
