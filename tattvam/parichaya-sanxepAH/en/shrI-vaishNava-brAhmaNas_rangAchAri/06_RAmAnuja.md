title = "06 Rāmānuja"

+++
The great reformer Rāmānuja who succeeded Ālavandar was born at Bhūtapuri (now called Sriperumbudur) in the year Pingala, in the month of Chitrai, on a Thursday, śukla paksha panchami under Ārdra star (४११८ of Kaliyuga = १०१७ A. D.), as the son of Āsuri Keśava Somayājī and Kāntimatī (sister of Śrīśaila Pūrṇa). According to some Āsuri Keśava Somayājī was a Vadama Brahman of Yajus Śākha, Āpastamba Sūtra and of Harita gotra.

Rāmānuja, when he was of the proper age, began his general and Vedic studies under Yadavaprakāśa, an Advaitic sanyāsin. Even while studying under this Advaitic sanyāsin he seems to have differed from his master in the interpretation of certain passages in the Vedas. According to the traditional account three instances are given and they are as described below :-- The first occasion to differ occurred when the Upanishad statement "Satyam jñānam anantam Brahma (Tait. Up. II-i, १) was explained by Yadavaprakāśa. This statement when translated into English is "Brahman (God) is Truth, Knowledge and Infinity." In explaining this passage Yadavaprakāśa held that the three attributes Truth, Knowledge and Infinity could not be predicted of Brahman, just as a cow could not be considered to be at the same time broken-horned, hornless and full horned. In other words Brahman cannot simultaneously be the possessor of various attributes. To Rāmanuja this explanation was not satisfactory and on being pressed to give his own explanation he gave out his own explanation as follows:-The attributes Truth, Knowledge and Infinity are mutually exclusive of one another and so are not incompatible in one and the same Being. The attribute Truth precludes all idea of momentary change; it is meant to fully establish that the existence of God is eternal. The second attribute of Knowledge is intended to establish that God is an all-knowing spirit and free from Achit, i.e., removes all possibility of the presence of Achit (lifeless matter in His nature). The attribute Infinity is meant to establish that Brahman is without limits or conditions, i.e., it puts an end to all conceptions of limitation of his essence.

"Truth, therefore, is the term which characterises Brahman as eternal, distinguishing it from what is non-eternal; Knowledge is the term which characterises Brahman as spirit or life distinguishing it from what is non-spirit or non-life; and Infinity which characterises Brahman as infinite distinguishing it from what is non-infinite (i.e., conditioned by ३-A [[०२५]]
[[२०]]

space-limits or mode limits). These attributes and infinite others can co-exist in Brahman without mutual contradiction, as redness, softness, perfume, etc., can harmoniously coexist in the flower. The analogy of the cow is not appropriate in this case; the analogy of the flower as quoted, or the sun having light and heat co-existing is appropriate.

And therefore to try to postulate an attributeless Brahman or a Brahman in whom different attributes cannot co-exist, is neither logical, nor consistent with the affirmatory character of the Vedic passage in question." ("Life of Sri Ramanuja"-Govinda Acharyapages ३०-३१.)

The second one in which Ramanuja differed from the explanation given by Yadavaprakāśa is given below :-- "Tasya yathā kapyasam pundarīkamēvam akshini." (Chand. Up.--Ch. I, sec. vii, ६-७.)

The explanation given by Yadavaprakāsa being blasphemous in character, Ramanuja was very much affected and tears ran down his eyes. The hot tears of indignation caused by the wanton sacrilege coursed down his cheeks and fell on Yadava's thighs and scalded them severely. On this he asked Ramanuja to say why he was crying and he explained the whole situation and said that the true explanation of the passage should be thus: -The eyes of the golden Person or God in the Sun are like the lotus blooming under the influence of the welcome rays of the Sun.

"Sir" cried Ramanuja "can you not see that ka means water, and pibati means to drink. Water drinker is thus kapi, the sun or the lotus-stalk. Asa is to open (vikasanē)

or to rest (upa vasane). Pundarika is the lotus And therefore God in the sun is He whose eyes are like the lotus growing in deep water which blooms under the balmy beams of the sun, or lotus which rests on its stalk below." It is to repudiate God to deny him Person; and when the Vedas postulate such a Personality it is doubly to repudiate Him by reading blasphemous similies into the Vedas, where reverential gravity and grandeur are intended.

Such constructions betoken nothing short of heresy." ("Life of Ramanuja "-- Govinda Acharya-page ३२.) This reply was too much for Yadavaprakāśa and so he asked Ramanuja to leave him as he cannot calmly take in his instruction. And Ramanuja departed without saying anything.

The third occasion for difference of opinion arose in explaining the following passages:- "Sarvam khalvidam Brahma." (Chand. Up. III, १०-१.)

"Neha na nāsti kinchana." (Brihad. Up. VI, ४-१९.)

Yadava was one day explaining the above Vedanta texts as if they meant that soul (man) and God were identical. The first passage means:-All this is indeed Brahman, and the second means there is not the least diversity here. According to Yadava, the first passage meant that all this cosmos is God; the second passage meant that all the diversities that are seen in the cosmos are illusory. Ramanuja took objection to these interpretations and said that the cosmos can never be identical with Brahman (God) nor can it be proved unreal.

For the first passage all this indeed is Brahman meant that the cosmos is permeated with [[०२६]]

[[२१]]
his spirit, i.e., full of God; in other words the cosmos has no existence independent of God; it exists by his Will. He is its Creator, Preserver and Destroyer. He is its Ruler and rules by his immanence. And the second passage meant that the diversity of the cosmos is real inasmuch as it is sustained by the unity of God; and therefore who so sees the diverse cosmos as severed from God sees not aright. There is but one God neither two nor many. In Him is All. That is the meaning of the text. Cosmos is not denied inasmuch as its existence is eternal substantially, though it exteriorly undergoes adjectival change. It is an axiom that nothing can come out of nothing. The cosmos is real. It is in God, who is thus One only, not many. This passage is thus an assertion, not a negation of the cosmos." ("Life of Ramanuja "–Govinda Acharya, page ४३.)

Soon after finishing his studies Ramanuja vacillated a little and had certain doubts.

So he requested Tirukachi Nambi to lay before Varadaraja, God at Conjeeveram, his doubts and get them cleared. The Sri Vaishnavas believe that Tirukacchi Nambi was a privileged being having the power of holding conversation with God Varadaraja.

One day Tirukacchi Nambi mentioned Ramanuja's doubt to Varadaraja who is said to have anticipated the questions and answered them as follows:- (१) I am the Supreme Reality or Truth.

(२) I and souls are different, i.e., there is essential difference between God and soul.

(३) By faith in me and final surrender (Prapatti) men reach me (i.e., attain salvation).

(४) Thought of me at the time of death (antima smriti) is not essential for the faithful.

(५) Such a one gets released from Samsara and attains moksha.

(६) The questioner (Ramanuja) should choose as his Acharya Maha Pūrṇa. Ramanuja's doubts disappeared and he respectfully accepted the answers communicated by Tirukachi Nambi.

Alavandar met two Sri Vaishnavas at Srirangam hailing from Kanchi and heard from them about Ramanuja's studying Vedanta under Yadavaprakāśa and also about the differences that arose between the master and the pupil in the explanation of Vedanta texts. On hearing all about Ramanuja he hurried to Kanchi where he was received with due honours by his disciple Tirukachi Nambi. While paying his respects and worshipping Varadaraja in his temple he saw Yadavaprakāśa coming with his followers. Being anxious to know Ramanuja, Alavandar asked if he was amongst the followers. Then Ramanuja was shown to Alavandar and he was mightily pleased with Ramanuja and sent after him his silent prayers. He prayed to God on the Hastagiri hill that Ramanuja should become the bearer of the torch of the Sri Vaishnava faith.

Ramanuja one day heard Maha Purna reciting Alavandar's sloka and was very anxious to meet Alavandar. So both Maha Pūrṇa and Ramanuja proceeded together to Srirangam, but to their grief they came too late to see Alavandar alive. However, they both saw the remains of Alavandar and at once they swooned. On recovering from the swoon Ramanuja exclaimed that he was unlucky and that he should give up the struggle [[०२७]]
[[२२]]

and resign himself to fate. Maha Pūrṇa encouraged him by soothing words, persuaded him to take a last look on the earthly remains of Yamunacharya (Alavandar). Ramanuja on looking at the mortal remains saw three of the fingers of the right palm of Alavandar folded. On questioning those that were with the sage they informed Ramanuja that "He was always full of expressions of unbounded gratitude towards Vyasa and Paraśara; his devotion to Sri Sathakopa was a thing by itself; and he used to regret that age and infirmities did not allow him to write a Viśishtadvaita Bhashya on the Brahma Sutras of Vyasa.' Ramanuja is said to have cried aloud "If I am allowed to remain on the earth long enough, if it be true that my Lord here is pleased with his humble servant, and if the Divine One deigns to grant my prayers, I have, before all of you, given my word that I will, to the best of my ability, carry out his last wishes. If my service is accepted, I pray that the closed fingers open." Ramanuja is said to have seen the fingers opening.

Extract from Prapannamritam:-Ramanuja very soon read the sign and exclaimed "I hereby promise to enter the Vaishnava faith; to devote myself, my time and energies to the task of saving humanity. I shall lead them to the true Faith, shall perfect them in the knowledge of the inner meanings of the Sacred Collect, and shall make them live out the doctrine of Prapatti." One of the fingers of Yamuna opened. Ramanuja continued "I shall embody the teachings of the Vedas, the Sastras and of the great gurus in a commentary on the Vyasa Sūtras, and place the means of salvation within the easy reach of all." Another of Yamuna's fingers opened of itself. Ramanuja went on "I shall select a holy Vaishnava and name him after the sage Parasara, who in the Vishnu Purana, had unanswerably established the prominence of the Supreme Self, his relation to the jIva and the path to liberation." The last finger of Yamunacharya unclosed.

Ramanuja returned to Conjeeveram and was doing service to Varadarājaswami.

Maha Pūrṇa left Srirangam to induce Ramanuja to come to Srirangam. At the same time Ramanuja left Kanchi with a view to go to Srirangam. Both Maha Pūrna and Ramanuja met accidentally at Madurantakam and Ramanuja pressed to be initiated into Vaishnavaite secrets. Agreeably to his wishes Maha Pūrṇa initiated him and both went back to Conjeeveram.

Later in life Ramanuja renounced family life and became a sanyasi of the Viśishtadvaita form. The main differences between an Advaitic sanyasi and a Sri Vaishnava sanyasi are in the staff and personal dress. The former usually carries with him a bamboo staff and the latter carries three bamboo sticks tied together as his staff.

The Viśishṭadvaita sanyasi retains his hair (kudumi), sacred thread and usually performs his daily rites such as sandhyavandanam, worship of God, whilst the Advaitic sanyasi has no tuft of hair and removes his sacred thread. He does not perform the usual sandhya, etc., which he performed before becoming a sanyasi.

Sometime after becoming a sanyasi Ramanuja sought Goshti Pūrṇa for further initiation. He after testing Ramanuja a number of times and finding him to be really well-devoted and sincere in his desire to obtain knowledge of God initiated him into the mysteries of the sacred words of the "Ashtakshari" mantra. But Ramanuja proceeded to [[०२८]]

[[२३]]
the temple at Tirukkottiyur and from its gopuram proclaimed to the Sri Vaishnavas after gathering them all the secrets communicated to him by Goshti Pūrna. On hearing about this incident Goshti Purna became angry and asked Ramanuja why he thus disobeyed the sacred injunction. Ramanuja replied that he divulged the secrets to all the Sri Vaishnavas so that they may all hand down to posterity these secrets. By this all of them have become your disciples and are therefore ever freed from the bonds of material existence.

I felt compassion for the Sri Vaishnavas and others of mankind and so this emboldened me to behave as I did and, if I incur any sin, it is likely to affect me only as an individual and the merit of the wholesale salvation goes to you. On hearing this explanation which showed the large-heartedness of Ramanuja, Goshti Purna was mightily pleased and from that moment he had the greatest regard for Ramanuja.

Ramanuja's greatness consists in his establishing firmly the Visishtadvaita philosophy, so well developed in his Sri Bhashya. It should not, however, be thought that he was the originator of this system of philosophy. It was in vogue even before his time. It was taught before Ramanuja's time by Bodhayana, Tanka, (also called Vakyakara) Bhagavat Sri Vatsanka Misra, Nathamuni and Alavandar. Many of these Acharyas promulgated this system of philosophy, but were not able to stem the theory of Advaitism so ably advocated by Sankara Acharya. Sankara Acharya based his Bhashya on Vedas and Upanishads.

In the face of the doctrine of Sankara Acharya the theory of love and bhakti could not be easily established. The one great attempt of the Azhvars and Acharyas that preceded Ramanuja was to preach the doctrine of bhakti or prapatti to disprove the theory of Maya or illusion.

It was left for Ramanuja to lay the foundation of Visistadvaita on a very firm basis by means of his writing the Sri Bhashya. He established the monotheistic principles on the basis of Brahma Sutras and Upanishads and thus succeeded in opposing successfully the Advaitic philosophy.

From the explanations given by Ramanuja in opposition to those given by Yadavaprakasa, his teacher, it is evident that he had Visistadvaitic views from his early age.

Further he was influenced very much by the writings of Azhvars and Acharyas, and in fact we may say that he realized in his own experience the ancient wisdom. So instead of trying to find out what his original views are it would be better to consider him as having propounded clearly and succinctly the wisdom of the wise of all times.

As the result of his inspiration from various sources his thoughts were moulded and he set forth a deeply religious view of God, soul and matter. His chief aim seems to have been to preach the doctrine of salvation through bhakti and to make it out to be the central teaching of the Upanishad, the Brahma Sutra and the Gita. It would not be an exaggeration if Ramanuja's attempt in the Sri Bhashya is described as an effort surpassing in merit and completeness any previous effort in the same direction.

He was undoubtedly the spokesman of his age. He proclaimed to the world the doctrine of Prapatti or self-surrender to God to be the means of salvation. He also took [[०२९]]

care not to reject the rituals and the regulations laid down according to the Vedas. In short as remarked by an European scholar "the teaching of Ramanuja presents to us the highest intellectual altitude in all its varied history by Indian Theism."
