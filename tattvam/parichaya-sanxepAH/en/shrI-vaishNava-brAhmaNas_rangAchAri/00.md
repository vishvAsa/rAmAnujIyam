## PREFACE.

This study of the Sri Vaishnava Brahmans aims at recording the customs of the people with which it deals as they are regarded within the community itself, the community to which the author belongs and within which he has therefore spent his long life.

Outside authorities may disagree with some of his conclusions. But the paper is intended not as a critical study so much as a record of traditions, customs and ceremonies as understood by those who adhere to them and as interpreted by one of their number who is also an anthropologist-Editor.
