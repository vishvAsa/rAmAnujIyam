चतुःश्लोकी । 
[Sri Yamunacarya- otherwise known as Sri Ala- vandar is the forerunner and spiritual Guru of Ramanuja. He is the author of Mahapurusha Nirnaya, Agamapramanya and Siddhitraya (Atma, Samvit and Isvara Siddhi)-scholarly works of a rather argumentative nature. His Stotra Ratna is a song overflowing with devotion to the Lord. He has written in his own lucid and melodious. stylo another hymn in four verses called Catus- sloki on Goddess Lakshmi. The four verses say that Lakshmi also has the four qualities which are attributed to Her consort Narayana in the four chapters of the Brahma Sutras. They are: i. He is the cause, efficient and material, of the whole universe; ii. His greatness is unsullied by anything; iii. He is the means by which one has to obtain the highest goal, the supreme bliss and iv. it is Himself. Lakshmi also has these. 
The first Sloka speaks about the Vibhutis of Goddess Lakshmi, the second about Her greatness which is incomprehensible even to Her omniscient Con- sort, the third about Her grace which grants the different wishes of all and the last speaks about Her charming forms which are ever insepara- ble from, and co-existent with, those of Sri Narayana. The Stotras of the Acaryas who came after, have been based more or less upon this and they elucidate the idea contained herein.]

कान्तस्ते पुरुषोत्तमः फणिपतिः शय्याssसनं वाहनं 
वेदात्मा विहगेश्वरो यवनिका माया जगन्मोहिनी । ब्रह्मेशादिसुरत्रजः सदयितस्त्वद्दासदासीजनः 
श्रीरित्येव च नाम ते भगवति ब्रूमः कथं त्वां वयम् ॥ १ ॥ 
1. O Goddess ! Purushottama, the greatest Lord of all Souls, (is) your consort ; the Lord of the hooded ( serpents, Adisesha ) ( is) your couch and throne; the sovereign of the birds, (Garuda ) whose body Vedas are, (is) your vehicle; Maya, the world-enchantress (i. e., Prakriti, composed of the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) (is) your veil; all the hosts of Gods with their sweethearts (are) your bevy of attendants and maids. Your name itself is Sri. (Possessed of all this greatness, as you are), how can we (ade- quately ) sing your praise ? 
यस्यास्ते महिमानमात्मन इव त्वद्वल्लभोऽपि प्रभुः 
नालं मातुमियत्तया निरवधिं नित्यानुकूलं स्वतः । तां त्वां दास इति प्रपन्न इति च स्तोष्याम्यहं निर्भयो 
लोकैकैश्वरि लोकनाथदयिते दान्ते दयां ते विदन् ॥२॥ 
2. Your greatness, which is boundless, eter- nal and ever blissful by nature, cannot be com- prehended in its entirety even by your Loving Consort, omnipotent though He be, even as He cannot His own greatness. O the Supreme

९८ 
Sovereign of the Universe! The Beloved of the Saviour of the Universe! I know you shower your mercy on those who seek refuge in you and so I fearlessly begin to sing (the greatness of) you. 
For I am both your servant and Prapanna (i.e., refugee). 
ईषत्त्वत्करुणानिरीक्षणसुधासन्धुक्षणात् रक्ष्यते 
नष्टं प्राक्तदलाभतः त्रिभुवनं संप्रत्यनन्तोदयं । श्रेयो न ह्यरविन्दलोचनमनः कान्ताप्रसादाहते 
संसृत्यक्षरवैष्णवाध्वसु नृणां संभाव्यते कर्हिचित् ॥ ३॥ 
3. Being blessed by the grace of a particle of the nectar of your merciful glances, the three worlds, non-existent before because of its absence, are saved (i.e., placed free from all troubles) now and are endowed with endless prosperity. For without the grace of the Darling of the heart of the Lotus-eyed ( Narayana ), the joy is never possible for the souls anywhere-in this world, in the Kaivalya and in the path of Vishnu (i.e., salvation). 
शान्तानन्तमहाविभूति परमं यद्ब्रह्म रूपं हरेः 
मूर्तं ब्रह्म ततोऽपि तत्प्रियतरं रूपं यदत्यद्भुतम् । यान्यन्यानि यथासुखं विहरतो रूपाणि सर्वाणि ता -- 
न्याहुः स्वैरनुरूपरूपविभवैः गाढोपगूढानि ते ॥ ४ ॥ 
4. With your wealth, splendour and forms suited to His own are inseparably united, they

say, all His forms: that aspect of His which is free from any modification, which is unlimited, which is the Lord of the Great Vibhuti and which is called the Para Brahman; that form (of Vishnu) which is called Brahman, which is marvellously charming and hence more liked by Him; and also all the other forms assumed by Him at his own pleasure to divert Himself.
