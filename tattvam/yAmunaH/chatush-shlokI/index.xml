He is the author of Mahapurusha Nirnaya, Agamapramanya and Siddhitraya (Atma, Samvit and Isvara Siddhi)-scholarly works of a rather argumentative nature. His Stotra Ratna is a song overflowing with devotion to the Lord. He has written in his own lucid and melodious. stylo another hymn in four verses called Catus- sloki on Goddess Lakshmi. The four verses say that Lakshmi also has the four qualities which are attributed to Her consort Narayana in the four chapters of the Brahma Sutras. They are: i. He is the cause, efficient and material, of the whole universe; ii. His greatness is unsullied by anything; iii. He is the means by which one has to obtain the highest goal, the supreme bliss and iv. it is Himself. Lakshmi also has these.&#xA;The first Sloka speaks about the Vibhutis of Goddess Lakshmi, the second about Her greatness which is incomprehensible even to Her omniscient Con- sort, the third about Her grace which grants the different wishes of all and the last speaks about Her charming forms which are ever insepara- ble from, and co-existent with, those of Sri Narayana. The Stotras of the Acaryas who came after, have been based more or less upon this and they elucidate the idea contained herein.]&#xA;९७&#xA;कान्तस्ते पुरुषोत्तमः फणिपतिः शय्याssसनं वाहनं&#xA;वेदात्मा विहगेश्वरो यवनिका माया जगन्मोहिनी । ब्रह्मेशादिसुरत्रजः सदयितस्त्वद्दासदासीजनः&#xA;श्रीरित्येव च नाम ते भगवति ब्रूमः कथं त्वां वयम् ॥ १ ॥&lt;/p&gt;</description>
