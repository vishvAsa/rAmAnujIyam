A critical edition of the Agamaprāmāṇya of Yāmunācārya, an authoritative work of the Viśiṣṭādvaita School of Vedānta, is now being published in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series.

The Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta is influenced by the Pāñcarātra Āgamas. In the Āgamaprāmāṇya Yāmunācārya, the grand teacher of Rāmānujācārya, has established the Vedic character of the Pāñcarātra Āgamas refuting all arguments advanced against their being considered as such.

Dr. Narasimhachary has tried his level best to edit the work critically with variants and informative and explanatory notes wherever necessary.

In the Introduction the learned editor has thoroughly discussed all relevant topics about Āgamas and about the author Yāmunācārya and his works. While dealing with the Āgamaprāmāṇya he has treated the Pāñcarātra Āgamas, their Vedic character and their influence on the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta. He has further discussed the influence of the Āgamaprāmāṇya on later writers of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school and summarised all topics discussed in the text.

Āgamaprāmāṇya has already been published thrice; however, the present critical edition will surely be welcomed and appreciated by Sanskrit Scholars and especially by the students of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta.

I take this opportunity to thank the University Grants Commission and the Government of Gujarat for giving financial aid towards the publication of this volume.
