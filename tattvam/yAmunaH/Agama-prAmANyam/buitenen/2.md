Besides, the Author of the Sūtras has already discarded the śruti, smṛti and profane views concerning the origination and reabsorption of the individual soul in the sūtra {{caracara paparayas tu syat tadayapadefo bhāktas tadbhacabḥācitrāt|carācaravyapāśrayas tu syāt tadvyapadeśo bhāktas tadbhāvabhāvitvāt}}.211 And since, moreover, the origination of the individual soul out of Brahman has been rejected in the sūtras {{nātmā śrutch nityatvāc ca tabhpal|nātmā śruter nityatvāc ca tābhyaḥ}},212 it does not occasion a renewed exposition: an issue which does not need being made a topic would then be made a topic.



 
211: {{BrS.|BṛS.}} 2\.3\.16 (17). Translation: "A word descriptive of moving or unmoving beings, has not a secondary meaning [in referring to Brahman], because such a being's existence depends on Brahman's existence."  
212: {{BrS.|BṛS.}}, 2\.3\.17 (18). Translation: "The {{atman|ātman}} is not born because there is no śruti to that effect, and because of its eternality, which is proved by the śrutis."

96\. This also explains the sūtra na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}};213 for it is not said here that the instrument, Sc. the mind, originates from the agent, sc. Saṅkarṣaṇa. For we have already stated that these names solely refer to the persons who {{superintendent|superintend}} these orders but are themselves different from them, OBJECTION. Then why this sūtra at all? For we do not find that instruments, like a hatchet, originate from an agent, like Devadatta, so that an instrument out of an agent makes no sense. REFUTATION. Well, then you reject the general view that all instruments, vital airs, mind etc. have their origin in Brahman which itself is without the entire collection of all instruments and rests solely on its own power; this view is stated in the text: "From it springs the vital air, the mind and all the senses."214 Or if you do agree on this because it is clearly proved in Revelation, I ask you why you don't agree on it because it is clearly proved in Pañcaratra. It is not a very proper procedure to deny things that are proved by smṛti; since both śruti and smṛti spring from perfect knowledge, they are equally valid.

97\. OBJECTION. The sūtra {{vijanadibhāve vā tadapratisedhal|vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}215 is explained as follows: The Author raises the question which one of two alternatives may be true: Are these four equally and independently sovereign, or has one a quaternity of personalities which he has assumed at his own desire? and then he points out the defect: if they are equally sovereign, none of them can be effects because they are equal; when they are different forms of one, what is the purpose of this division? REFUTATION. That is not correct, because an alternative is impossible. For no one who holds that there is a God theorizes that the world has several Gods, least of all the {{Pañcaratrikas|Pāñcarātrikas}} who hold that "Vāsudeva is the ultimate material cause". But this one Bhagavān, who has divided Himself into four for reasons of sport, protects the entire world. And this position is not unjustified, because it is justified in the same manner as the appearance of second-born and first-born brothers like Bala and Bharata. For just as the Bhagavān, who has created the variety of phenomena of ether, 'Wind, Śiva, {{Brahma|Brahmā}} etc. for His sport, whose sole motivation is the sport of his unfathomable power, has voluntarily assumed the personalities of {{Rama|Rāma}}, {{Laksmana|Lakṣmaṇa}}, Bharata, {{Satrughna|Śatrughna}} etc., without there being the possibility of logical conflict in the same manner the divisions of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, too, are unconflicting.

215: {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.44\.

98\. Furthermore, {{vipratiṣedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}216 may mean "because of conflict with Revelation", on the basis of the citation "failing to find in the four Vedas..." or "because of mutual conflict between the {{Tanti as|Tantras}} themselves". The former alternative, incompatibility with Revelation has already been refuted as being without valid basis. Mutual conflict between the {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras themselves, whose terminological precision has been perfected by the rules of logic governing principal matter, generality, peculiarity, quality and the like, does not exist. On the other hand, statements that lack the corroboration of logic can have no cogency; as the maxim says: "A statement must have precision perfected by logic before it can communicate its meaning." Consequently, the Author of the Sūtras gives the lie to those exegetes who, {{hy|by}} superimposing on the {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras (whose validity he strongly affirms as no less than that of the Vedas, in such assertions as "{{idam mahopanisadam|idaṃ mahopaniṣadam}}," etc.) the non-existent doctrine of the soul's origination, explain that the sūtra means to reject the Pañcaratra Tantras. Enough.

216: {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.45\.  

99\. The meaning of the Sūtras is this. First the Author has set forth that the doctrines of Kapila, {{Kasyapa|Kaśyapa}}, Buddha, Jina and {{Pasupati|Paśupati}}, who oppose the Author's own accepted doctrine, are unnatural217 because they conflict with Revelation and logic. Now, in order to remove the suspicion that the {{Pancarãtra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras (which are his own accepted {{doctine|doctrine}}) are equally unnatural with the other doctrines because their usual enumeration on an equal plane with the others has made them closely associated with them in people's thinking, he elicits their validity. In the first two Sūtras the prima-facie case is laid down: the {{Pancarãtra|Pāñcarātra}} likewise has no validity, {{ulpallyasambhavat|utpattyasaṃbhavāt}}, i.e., on account of the impossibility of {{Sarıkarṣaṇa's|Saṅkarṣaṇa's}} origination which is taught there. Why should it be impossible? Because it cannot be established in either of two possible cases; either the four {{has|vyūhas}} are equally sovereign, or else one God exists in four persons; and in either case there is impossibility of origination. If they are equally sovereign, they cannot be created because they are equal; if only one being is admitted no origination is possible either, since a distribution within one being of creating and created parts is inconceivable.

217: In {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2,2\.  
218: {{asamañjasya|āsamañjasya}}, taken from {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.37\.  

[[84]]

100\. Similarly na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}: {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} has no validity for the further reason that it is impossible that the instrument, sc. the mind called Pradyumna, originates from the agent, sc. the individual soul called Saṅkarṣaṇa, for the hatchet does not originate from Devadatta. Or there is this alternative explanation of na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}: and for the further reason that the instrument does not originate from the agent Saṅkarṣaṇa, since according to the text: "From it spring the vital air, the mind and all the senses," it is revealed that all instruments really originate from Brahman.

101\. Then follows: {{vijñānādibhāre va tadapratisedhali|vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}. By the particle ca this prima-facie case is now reversed. What has been said, viz., that there is no validity since in neither case origination of Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. is possible, is untrue: it is not contradictory that Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. have originated. Indeed, it would be contradictory if they were not {{oijnanadi|vijñānādi}}. Vijñānādi is a dvandva compound: "knowledge and beginning," that means: Brahman; thus {{mijnānādibhāve|vijñānādibhāve}} means {{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}. Inasmuch as they are Brahman ({{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}), the origination is not contradictory. That is to say by virtue of the fact that the unique Supreme Soul Vāsudeva, whose omnipotence is unbounded, enters into them through His māyā, a cause-effect relation is justified. The objection that the mind cannot originate from Saṅkarṣaṇa, on the authority of the śruti that the mind originates from Brahman, is invalidated by the fact that he, sc. Saṅkarṣaṇa is {{vijānadi|vijñānādi}}, i.e., Brahman.

[[85]]

102\. Furthermore, what is being said in the argument na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}? Is it that the instrument of a certain action does not originate from the agent of that same action; or that no instrument of any action whatever originates from any agent whatsoever? If the first view is taken, we have a conflict with Inference, because the argument contains the fallacy of proving the proved. The mind, originating from the agent Saṅkarṣaṇa cannot be the instrument of {{Samkarsana's|Saṅkarṣaṇa's}} action of originating it, since it itself is the object of the action; nor can it be the instrument of the action of being originated, since it itself is the agent of that action. If the alternative view is taken, we have a conflict with Perception, because we see that for instance a pitcher, though it be the instrument of an action of fetching water, yet originates from the agent of such an action, the potter. This the Author says in the sūtra {{vibratiṣedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}: 'because there is conflict.'

[[86]] AGAMA PRAMANYAN

103\. As to the other explanation that has been given of these two Sūtras,219 since it is {{vijanadi|vijñānādi}}, i.c. "a ground for validity",220 the denial of the validity of Pāñcarātra is not justified, because it entails overextension. The invalidity, which is defined by the non-origination of knowledge through repetition or dubiety in the Tantras, is rejected, because knowledge is actually had from them. In order to remove the suspicion of untruth occasioned by the speaker's character, the word {{adi|ādi}} is used to convey the intended meaning that the Tantras are in fact spoken by a trustworthy person. Consequently the meaning is this: He always has direct knowledge of the entire world by virtue of the omniscience which is part of His nature; He bestows man's wishes upon him, when He is satisfied—and he is satisfied by meditation alone; Him the experts in the Veda describe as eternally satisfied in all His desires: how then can there be defects in Him like error, deceit etc.?

219: supra §§96, 97\.  
220: i.e., as a {{fat purusa|tatpuruṣa}} compound "the beginning (source) of (valid) knowledge:" {{aijāānddibkor|vijñānādibhāvāt}} "since He (God) is a source of valid knowledge."  

104\. The 'impossibility of origination,' which has been stated in the first two Sūtras, is thereupon denied for Saṅkarṣaṇa and the other forms of God in the sūtra {{vipratisedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}. This means either; "Because there is conflict with the Bhagavān's perception which is inferred through Pañcaratra;" or "Because there is conflict with {{Sruti|Śruti}} which is inferred from the same Tradition."

[[87]]

105\. Or there is another interpretation: since the Sūtras intend to illustrate the rules of exegesis, the author first assumes that there is a conflict between Śruti and Pañcaratra, though in fact there is no such conflict, and then reasons this out as follows: suppose that Pañcaratra is in conflict with the veda, is this {{sastra|śāstra}} then, like the statements of Manu etc., valid or invalid? This question is thereupon answered: "It is invalid, because of the impossibility of the origination of valid knowledge concerning a conflicting sense; and this impossibility itself is proved on the ground that there is independence of something that is dependent." Thus the sūtra {{utpallyasambhavat|utpattyasaṃbhavāt}} means: "because it is impossible that a valid knowledge originates, since, as long as the dependent Pañcaratra Tradition does not start proving the validity of its own sense by establishing the validity of its basis, the cognition which originates from the independent {{preterpersonal|pre-personal}} scripture determines the Tradition's sense as being different, and consequently conflicting with itself. For Pāñcarātra conveys that scripture is its basis only as long as the sword of direct scripture does not cut its root.

106\. OBJECTION. But why should the Vedas themselves be independent, since their validity, too, depends on the direct cognition of the Bhagavān, because this cognition is their cause?221 Just as the Pāñcarātra Traditions are dependent on His cognition, so are the Vedas too dependent on His cognition.222

221: cf. supra § 18\.  
222: {{Karmani Lyu! Papini|Karmaṇi Lyuṭ Pāṇini}}.  

[[88]]

{{RITUTATION|REFUTATION}}. To refute this view, the statement is made: na ca kartuḥ karaṇam: "The Vedas are not the product of a maker, i.e. the Bhagavān. {{Karana|Karaṇa}} here in the sense of "things that are made or produced," by the rule "suffix-{{aia|lyuṭ}} in the sense of the object of the action." This then means that the Vedas are {{preterhuman|pre-personal}}.

107\. {{Vijñānādibhrive vai tadapratised halt|Vijñānādibhāve vai tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}. If, on the other hand, it is not true that the {{Pañcaratra Sastra|Pāñcarātra Śāstra}} is invalid, then what? {{tadapratised hali|tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}, i e. non-rejection of the origination of valid knowledge (namely, even when partly conflicting, the conflicting statement may be valid optionally), because it is based upon the direct cognition of the Bhagavān in whom error and deceit are impossible as He is a source of vijñāna (vijñānādibhāve): Vijñāna means "knowledge par excellence in which no mistake is possible. For since all other authors of {{Dharmasastras|Dharmaśāstras}} are not omniscient, as they are involved in {{samsara|saṃsāra}}, and since therefore they are also not entirely selfsufficient, various lapses are {{con ceivable|conceivable}} in their knowledge. Whereas in the case of the Bhagavān, whose supremacy is natural and unlimited, His knowledge is the immediate insight in all dharma and adharma, which is natural to Him and true, as is known from hundreds of śrutis; it is this knowledge which in the sūtra is described as vijñāna, When such knowledge is the 'beginning,' i.e. the basis, there is non-rejection, sc. the {{Sastra|Śāstra}} is valid.
