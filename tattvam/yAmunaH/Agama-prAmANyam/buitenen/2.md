What has been said, viz., that there is no validity since in neither case origination of Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. is possible, is untrue: it is not contradictory that Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. have originated. Indeed, it would be contradictory if they were not {{oijnanadi|vijñānādi}}. Vijñānādi is a dvandva compound: "knowledge and beginning," that means: Brahman; thus {{mijnānādibhāve|vijñānādibhāve}} means {{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}. Inasmuch as they are Brahman ({{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}), the origination is not contradictory. That is to say by virtue of the fact that the unique Supreme Soul Vāsudeva, whose omnipotence is unbounded, enters into them through His māyā, a cause-effect relation is justified. The objection that the mind cannot originate from Saṅkarṣaṇa, on the authority of the śruti that the mind originates from Brahman, is invalidated by the fact that he, sc. Saṅkarṣaṇa is {{vijānadi|vijñānādi}}, i.e., Brahman.

102\. Furthermore, what is being said in the argument na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}? Is it that the instrument of a certain action does not originate from the agent of that same action; or that no instrument of any action whatever originates from any agent whatsoever? If the first view is taken, we have a conflict with Inference, because the argument contains the fallacy of proving the proved. The mind, originating from the agent Saṅkarṣaṇa cannot be the instrument of {{Samkarsana's|Saṅkarṣaṇa's}} action of originating it, since it itself is the object of the action; nor can it be the instrument of the action of being originated, since it itself is the agent of that action. If the alternative view is taken, we have a conflict with Perception, because we see that for instance a pitcher, though it be the instrument of an action of fetching water, yet originates from the agent of such an action, the potter. This the Author says in the sūtra {{vibratiṣedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}: 'because there is conflict.'

103\. As to the other explanation that has been given of these two Sūtras,219 since it is {{vijanadi|vijñānādi}}, i.c. "a ground for validity",220 the denial of the validity of Pāñcarātra is not justified, because it entails overextension. The invalidity, which is defined by the non-origination of knowledge through repetition or dubiety in the Tantras, is rejected, because knowledge is actually had from them. In order to remove the suspicion of untruth occasioned by the speaker's character, the word {{adi|ādi}} is used to convey the intended meaning that the Tantras are in fact spoken by a trustworthy person. Consequently the meaning is this: He always has direct knowledge of the entire world by virtue of the omniscience which is part of His nature; He bestows man's wishes upon him, when He is satisfied—and he is satisfied by meditation alone; Him the experts in the Veda describe as eternally satisfied in all His desires: how then can there be defects in Him like error, deceit etc.?

219: supra §§96, 97\.  
220: i.e., as a {{fat purusa|tatpuruṣa}} compound "the beginning (source) of (valid) knowledge:" {{aijāānddibkor|vijñānādibhāvāt}} "since He (God) is a source of valid knowledge."  

104\. The 'impossibility of origination,' which has been stated in the first two Sūtras, is thereupon denied for Saṅkarṣaṇa and the other forms of God in the sūtra {{vipratisedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}. This means either; "Because there is conflict with the Bhagavān's perception which is inferred through Pañcaratra;" or "Because there is conflict with {{Sruti|Śruti}} which is inferred from the same Tradition."

[[87]]

105\. Or there is another interpretation: since the Sūtras intend to illustrate the rules of exegesis, the author first assumes that there is a conflict between Śruti and Pañcaratra, though in fact there is no such conflict, and then reasons this out as follows: suppose that Pañcaratra is in conflict with the veda, is this {{sastra|śāstra}} then, like the statements of Manu etc., valid or invalid? This question is thereupon answered: "It is invalid, because of the impossibility of the origination of valid knowledge concerning a conflicting sense; and this impossibility itself is proved on the ground that there is independence of something that is dependent." Thus the sūtra {{utpallyasambhavat|utpattyasaṃbhavāt}} means: "because it is impossible that a valid knowledge originates, since, as long as the dependent Pañcaratra Tradition does not start proving the validity of its own sense by establishing the validity of its basis, the cognition which originates from the independent {{preterpersonal|pre-personal}} scripture determines the Tradition's sense as being different, and consequently conflicting with itself. For Pāñcarātra conveys that scripture is its basis only as long as the sword of direct scripture does not cut its root.

106\. OBJECTION. But why should the Vedas themselves be independent, since their validity, too, depends on the direct cognition of the Bhagavān, because this cognition is their cause?221 Just as the Pāñcarātra Traditions are dependent on His cognition, so are the Vedas too dependent on His cognition.222

221: cf. supra § 18\.  
222: {{Karmani Lyu! Papini|Karmaṇi Lyuṭ Pāṇini}}.  

[[88]]

{{RITUTATION|REFUTATION}}. To refute this view, the statement is made: na ca kartuḥ karaṇam: "The Vedas are not the product of a maker, i.e. the Bhagavān. {{Karana|Karaṇa}} here in the sense of "things that are made or produced," by the rule "suffix-{{aia|lyuṭ}} in the sense of the object of the action." This then means that the Vedas are {{preterhuman|pre-personal}}.

107\. {{Vijñānādibhrive vai tadapratised halt|Vijñānādibhāve vai tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}. If, on the other hand, it is not true that the {{Pañcaratra Sastra|Pāñcarātra Śāstra}} is invalid, then what? {{tadapratised hali|tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}, i e. non-rejection of the origination of valid knowledge (namely, even when partly conflicting, the conflicting statement may be valid optionally), because it is based upon the direct cognition of the Bhagavān in whom error and deceit are impossible as He is a source of vijñāna (vijñānādibhāve): Vijñāna means "knowledge par excellence in which no mistake is possible. For since all other authors of {{Dharmasastras|Dharmaśāstras}} are not omniscient, as they are involved in {{samsara|saṃsāra}}, and since therefore they are also not entirely selfsufficient, various lapses are {{con ceivable|conceivable}} in their knowledge. Whereas in the case of the Bhagavān, whose supremacy is natural and unlimited, His knowledge is the immediate insight in all dharma and adharma, which is natural to Him and true, as is known from hundreds of śrutis; it is this knowledge which in the sūtra is described as vijñāna, When such knowledge is the 'beginning,' i.e. the basis, there is non-rejection, sc. the {{Sastra|Śāstra}} is valid.
