Moreover, if a cognition concerning a content that is also known through another means of knowledge does not recognize its own content as authoritative, since it has already been taken care of by another authority, this {{non-authoritativenes|non-authoritativeness}} of its content is beyond experience for it is a mere matter of assumption. Therefore it must be maintained that all indubitable and unreversed knowledge is authoritative, regardless of whether its content is established, or yet to be performed, or anything else. Hence we reject our opponent's position.

76\. The objections that omniscience is acquired by means of the regular senses is incorrect, because śruti contradicts it: "He sees without eyes, hears with{{out}} ears; he who does not see with the eye, who sees the eyes, has neither effect nor instrument;"153 "knowledge, strength and action are natural to Him,"154 etc. These śrutis do not speak metaphorically, for there is no authority for this assumption. Metaphorical usage is assumed when the primary meanings of the śrutis make no sense. Since the primary meaning here makes sense, the assumption of metaphorical use is baseless.

77\. OBJECTION. But in this case we have in fact reason to cancel the {{primay|primary}} meaning, because the primary sense militates against other means of knowledge. REFUTATION. What other means of knowledge? Not, to start, Perception, for we see no Perception occur which shows that the said Person is non-existent. If you retort that non-existence is decided by the nonapprehension of what should be there, we reply that this does not hold in our case since the object, that is the said Person, is actually apprehended through Scripture itself, which is the highest-ranking among the assembly of the means of knowledge. Nor does it militate against Inference; for how could an Inference which disproves that Person arise at all, slow-moving as it is, when its object is instantly refuted by the rapidly arising scriptural cognition? Moreover, if this were so, the relation of sacrificing etc. to heaven, {{apúrva|apūrva}}155 etc., would logically be contradicted by the fact that sacrificing etc. are actions, when Scripture did not cancel such reasoning. True, the identity of sacrificial pole and sun, which is asserted by Scripture, is cancelled by another means of knowledge, namely Perception alone, because the difference between a piece of wood and the disc of the sun is indeed obvious. Besides, in this case it is legitimate to assume metaphorical usage, for the statement of this identity is an {{arthavada|arthavāda}},156 since it forms one single statement with the proximate injunction about the unction of the sacrificial pole. There is no other injunction to which it could be accessory as an {{arthatada|arthavāda}}.157 Alternatively, inasmuch as the human importance of a statement would be lost if there were no injunction to connect it with, an injunction may be supplemented and then the {{arthavada|arthavāda}} is regarded as accessory to that supplemented injunction.

78\. The objection158 that as long as statements fail to prompt the operator of the means of knowledge to being active or to prevent him from being active, they do not communicate self-sufficient information, does not hold good. For, we find that statements have human importance also outside any connection with an injunction; in such a case it will be as in the statement “A son has been born to you," and the like. Nor need an injunction be supplemented in these cases. For without an injunction, too, joy arises from the information that a son has been born. Likewise, a statement which is self-sufficient in merely expressing particular actions which questioners want to know in exchanges of question and answer-e.g. "Which action?" "Cooking!"-do not require the supplementation of an injunction. In the upaniṣadic texts the knowledge of brahman is declared to be rewarded by great bliss: "the brahman-knower becomes brahman";159 "the {{brahman knower|brahman-knower}} attains the supreme";160 "the {{saman|sāman}} cantor attains with brahman all that he desires:"161 the human importance of statements without injunctions is quite clear from these and other scriptural words. To sum up, when it is established that the Bhagavān is the treasury solely of beautiful qualities of direct universal cognition, compassionateness etc., qualities which are true and natural to Him, and which we know from hundreds of quoted śrutis, then it is also established that the Tantra which is based on His universal cognition is authoritative indeed.

79\. OBJECTION. Granted that, as you have described it, there exists some Person who is endowed with natural omniscience, as it is known from the upaniṣads, yet, unless it is absolutely certain that this Person is indeed Hari, Pañcaratra will not be authoritative. REFUTATION. This is a worthless remark; no experts in the Veda dispute that the Supreme Soul, cause of the entire universe, is Vāsudeva. For He is revealed in the upaniṣads as the Supreme Soul: "Truth, knowledge, infinite; that is the supreme step of Viṣṇu. Vāsudeva is the ultimate matter, the ultimate spirit".161 He was alone beyond who became this world;162 "higher than whom there is nothing at all". In accordance with the subject expressed in these statements there are passages like: "From whom these beings..." "Sat alone, my son..." "Therefore Viṣṇu's perfect knowledge is established by the upaniṣads. And it is not declared in śruti that the origination, subsistence and destruction of the world are caused by anyone but Him. Hence there is a consensus that He is the supreme omniscient soul. That He is the Supreme Soul we learn also from the statements of {{Dvaipayana|Dvaipāyana}}, Parāśara, {{Narada|Nārada}} and other great seers. Thus "Know {{theu|thou}}, O tormentor of thy foes, that the entire world rests on Viṣṇu. The Great Viṣṇu creates the totality of creatures, moving and unmoving. In him they go to their reabsorption, from Him they originate," "The glorious Sage Nārāyaṇa, without beginning or end, is the sovereign Lord. He creates the creatures, those that stand still and those that move."163 That He is the Supreme Brahman is also learnt elsewhere. "Kesava, O best of the {{Bharatas|Bhāratas}}, the Blessed One, is the sovereign, the supreme soul, the entire universe: thus it stands revealed in many places of the Scripture."164 For those who seek to know the supreme principle by means of many-sided reasonings Hari alone is the Principle, the great Yogin, Nārāyaṇa the Lord.165 Likewise in the {{Danadharma|Dānadharma}}, "{{Padmanabha|Padmanābha}} is the Supreme Soul, the highest One, the pure One, the Refuge. This is the secret doctrine of the Veda; dost thou not know, sacker of cities? By His grace do we all cause the worlds to exist. And the trusted ones, and the first among the immortals, and the gods are held to be His representatives, If Viṣṇu is indifferent, no good will come to us." Thus Rudra's word.166 Similarly, in the Mahābhārata and {{Matsya Purana|Matsya Purāṇa}}, "He who amongst them is the Supreme Soul, He indeed is the eternal, unqualified, perfect One; He is to be known as Nārāyaṇa, for He is the world-soul, the Spirit." Likewise in the {{Varaha Purana|Varāha Purāṇa}}, "Who, excepting the Lord {{Narayana|Nārāyaṇa}}, is superior to the God whose conduct has become the life-order on the earth?" "There has been no God greater than Nārāyaṇa, nor shall there be; this is the secret doctrine of the Vedas and the {{Purāņas|Purāṇas}}, O excellent ones."

Likewise in the {{Linga Purana|Liṅga Purāṇa}}, "{{Janardana|Janārdana}} is the sole Spirit, the highest One, the Supreme Soul, from whom {{Brahma|Brahmā}} was born; from Him Rudra and from Him all the world." Likewise {{Paragara's|Parāśara's}} word,' The world has originated from Viṣṇu 'and' on Him it rests. He is the maker of its subsistence and its destruction."167 Likewise in the {{Manavadharmaśāstra|Mānavadharmaśāstra}},168 "Nārāyaṇa is higher than the unmanifest; the World-Egg originates from the unmanifest. Within the Egg are all these worlds as well as the earth with her seven continents." Therefore, the study of these and similar śrutis, smṛtis, epical texts and {{purāņas|purāṇas}} proves that Vāsudeva is the universal cause, the Supreme Soul.

168: A little known Vedic branch (if it was a Vedic tradition), from which certain {{Vaisnava|Vaiṣṇava}} sects derive their authority; cf. infra §138\.  

80\. Nor do the śrutis declare that Rudra is the Supreme Soul, or that any other deity is. On the contrary, the followers of the {{Ekayana śākhā|Ekāyana śākhā}}169 say that he has an origin, and the same is found in the Veda itself: "Darkness was here.... from which Rudra is born; that is the greatest in all the worlds, that indeed is the oldest in the worlds." Similarly, Rudra's position is clearly known to be a result of his karman: "He obtained his greatness by propitiating Viṣṇu." "From the forehead sprang a drop; from that Rudra was born,"170 These and other śrutis declare that Rudra was born. This being so, the statements that in appearance convey the greatness of Rudra and others really serve as laudatory statements, like the śruti: "the car is brahman."

169: These quotations could not be identified.

[[67]]

Consequently, the passages in the {{Puranas|Purāṇas}} which declare Rudra etc. to be the Supreme Soul have not their primary meaning, because they are in conflict with Perception and Scripture.

81\. Concerning the objection that the assertions of the doctrines of the Tantras are to be rejected since their greatness is set forth only in non-Vedic Tantric texts, we say that Viṣṇu is stated to be the Supreme One in the texts of the Way of the Vedic doctrine. For example in the {{Viṣņu Purāṇa|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}, "The Supreme Soul, the Basis of all creatures, the Supreme Lord is called by the name of Viṣṇu in Vedas and {{Upanisads|Upaniṣads}}."171 In the {{Varaha Purana|Varāha Purāṇa}}, "The Supreme Brahman is Viṣṇu; the triple division in the pathways of the Vedic doctrine is here set forth; the ignorant do not know this."172 "There has been no god greater than Nārāyaṇa, nor shall there be; this is the secret doctrine of Vedas and {{Puranas|Purāṇas}}, O excellent ones."173 Likewise in the {{Matsya Purana|Matsya Purāṇa}}, "In those aeons where sattva prevails, the greatness of Viṣṇu is declared. In aeons predominated by tamas the greatness of Fire and {{Siva|Śiva}} is expounded."174 Likewise in the {{Linga Purana|Liṅga Purāṇa}}, "For there is no other recourse ordained but Viṣṇu; this the Vedas constantly declare, no doubt about it."175 Likewise in the {{Vayu Purana|Vāyu Purāṇa}},

171: {{Visnu Pur.|Viṣṇu Pur.}} 6\.4\.40\.  
172: cf. {{Varaha Pur.|Varāha Pur.}}, 72\.4, which reads {{padrate|pūjyate}} in b.  
173: cf. {{Varaha Pur.|Varāha Pur.}} {{7026|70\.26}} na tasmāt parato devo bhavitā na {{bhavisyati|bhaviṣyati}}. It is clear from several quotations from this {{Purana|Purāṇa}} that {{Yamuna's|Yāmuna's}} text had different readings, not all of them better.

"The Spirit that belongs to the Way of the Veda is {{explaind|explained}} to be the thousand-armed supreme lord of creatures." Likewise in the {{Bhavisyat Purana|Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa}}, "Visnu is traditionally known to be the {{Sepreme|Supreme}} in the pathways of the Vedic doctrine. Viṣṇu is the greatest among persons, the most exalted Supreme Person." All this has already been explained in great detail in the {{Purusanirnaya|Puruṣanirṇaya}}176 and is therefore not further enlarged upon here. Therefore, how can our tongue endeavour to say that the Tantra which is revealed by {{Visanu|Viṣṇu}} who is known from the {{Upanisads|Upaniṣads}} is false? For He is such that He has an immediate insight into the dharma of Consecration, Propitiation etc., by virtue of the omniscience that is natural to Him.177

Also in the {{Santiparavan|Śāntiparvan}}: "Certainly, the {{Vaisnava|Vaiṣṇava}} must undergo Consecration with all effort: for Hari will be particularly graceful to one who has been consecrated and to no one else.204 One should consecrate a Brahmin in spring, a {{Ksatriya|Kṣatriya}} in summer, a {{Vaisya|Vaiśya}} in the autumn, a {{Sudra|Śūdra}} in winter, a woman in the rainy season according to the {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} doctrine."205 And likewise: "It has been made commensurate with the four Vedas on the great Mountain Meru."206 Now, how could {{Dvaipayana|Dvaipāyana}} reject the Pañcaratra, which is his own supreme doctrine, comprising the sense of the {{Upanisads|Upaniṣads}}, as follows from these and a hundred direct and circumlocutory declarations made with full respect?

95\. {{ODJECTION|OBJECTION}}. But then how to explain the {{sutra|sūtra}} {{ulballyasaṇibhavā!?|utpattyasaṃbhavāt!?}}207
REPLY. What is the intention of the sūtra?
OBJECTION. The following: Since it is expounded in the {{Bhagavata Sastra|Bhāgavata Śāstra}} that the individual soul has an origin, and since this is impossible as it militates against Scripture and Logic, therefore this {{gastra|śāstra}} is erroneous. REPLY. If that is the meaning of the {{sutra|sūtra}}, then how can the {{sutra|sūtra}} be intended to reject the {{Pancarātra Sastra|Pāñcarātra Śāstra}}? For the {{Pancarātra Sastras|Pāñcarātra Śāstras}} do not accept that the individual soul has an origin, which assumption would have justified the {{sutra's|sūtra's}} rejection. OBJECTION. But is it not their assertion that Vāsudeva is at once the supreme material cause and the supreme spirit; that from him the individual soul {{Sankarṣana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} is born, from {{Samkarṣaṇa|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} the mind called Pradyumna, and from the latter the ego called Aniruddha?
REPLY. NO. The personal manifestation of God is described as being constituted by {{vyuhar|vyūhas}},208 and the word individual soul" is assigned to one of these {{oyihas|vyūhas}} for practical purposes, in order to prove clearly the differences that exist within the Adorable One, which differences are in accordance with those of the varṇas. It is as they say: "The four {{vyhas|vyūhas}} are to be worshipped successively by the four varṇas successively." Besides, the words 'individual soul,' 'mind' and 'ego' do not denote these {{tanmatraso|tanmātras}}209 themselves, but refer to a person who is the superintending deity of these orders and whose personality is entirely different from the order he superintends. Birth is described as the acquisition of various bodies, as is said in the statement {{toyena jioan|toyena jīvān}} in the {{Yajurmurdhan|Yajurmūrdhan}}.210 Besides, the Author of the {{Sutras|Sūtras}} has already discarded the śruti, smṛti and profane views concerning the origination and reabsorption of the individual soul in the {{sutra|sūtra}} {{caracara paparayas tu syat tadayapadefo bhāktas tadbhacabḥācitrāt|carācaravyapāśrayas tu syāt tadvyapadeśo bhāktas tadbhāvabhāvitvāt}}.211 And since, moreover, the origination of the individual soul out of Brahman has been rejected in the sūtras {{nātmā śrutch nityatvāc ca tabhpal|nātmā śruter nityatvāc ca tābhyaḥ}},212 it does not occasion a renewed exposition: an issue which does not need being made a topic would then be made a topic.

[[81]]

96\. This also explains the sūtra na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}};213 for it is not said here that the instrument, Sc. the mind, originates from the agent, sc. {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}}. For we have already stated that these names solely refer to the persons who {{superintendent|superintend}} these orders but are themselves different from them, OBJECTION. Then why this {{sutra|sūtra}} at all? For we do not find that instruments, like a hatchet, originate from an agent, like Devadatta, so that an instrument out of an agent makes no sense. REFUTATION. Well, then you reject the general view that all instruments, vital airs, mind etc. have their origin in Brahman which itself is without the entire collection of all instruments and rests solely on its own power; this view is stated in the text: "From it springs the vital air, the mind and all the senses."214 Or if you do agree on this because it is clearly proved in Revelation, I ask you why you don't agree on it because it is clearly proved in Pañcaratra. It is not a very proper procedure to deny things that are proved by smṛti; since both śruti and smṛti spring from perfect knowledge, they are equally valid.

213: {{BrS|BṛS}}, 2\.2\.43\.  
214: {{Mund Up.|Muṇḍ Up.}}, 2\.1\.3\.  

[[82]]

97\. OBJECTION. The {{sutra|sūtra}} {{vijanadibhāve vā tadapratisedhal|vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}215 is explained as follows: The Author raises the question which one of two alternatives may be true: Are these four equally and independently sovereign, or has one a quaternity of personalities which he has assumed at his own desire? and then he points out the defect: if they are equally sovereign, none of them can be effects because they are equal; when they are different forms of one, what is the purpose of this division? REFUTATION. That is not correct, because an alternative is impossible. For no one who holds that there is a God theorizes that the world has several Gods, least of all the {{Pañcaratrikas|Pāñcarātrikas}} who hold that "Vāsudeva is the ultimate material cause". But this one Bhagavān, who has divided Himself into four for reasons of sport, protects the entire world. And this position is not unjustified, because it is justified in the same manner as the appearance of second-born and first-born brothers like Bala and Bharata. For just as the Bhagavān, who has created the variety of phenomena of ether, 'Wind, {{Siva|Śiva}}, {{Brahma|Brahmā}} etc. for His sport, whose sole motivation is the sport of his unfathomable power, has voluntarily assumed the personalities of {{Rama|Rāma}}, {{Laksmana|Lakṣmaṇa}}, Bharata, {{Satrughna|Śatrughna}} etc., without there being the possibility of logical conflict in the same manner the divisions of {{Samkarṣaṇa|Saṅkarṣaṇa}}, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, too, are unconflicting.

215: {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.44\.  

[[83]]

98\. Furthermore, {{vipratiṣedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}216 may mean "because of conflict with Revelation", on the basis of the citation "failing to find in the four Vedas..." or "because of mutual conflict between the {{Tanti as|Tantras}} themselves". The former alternative, incompatibility with Revelation has already been refuted as being without valid basis. Mutual conflict between the {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras themselves, whose terminological precision has been perfected by the rules of logic governing principal matter, generality, peculiarity, quality and the like, does not exist. On the other hand, statements that lack the corroboration of logic can have no cogency; as the maxim says: "A statement must have precision perfected by logic before it can communicate its meaning." Consequently, the Author of the {{Sutras|Sūtras}} gives the lie to those exegetes who, {{hy|by}} superimposing on the {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras (whose validity he strongly affirms as no less than that of the Vedas, in such assertions as "{{idam mahopanisadam|idaṃ mahopaniṣadam}}," etc.) the non-existent doctrine of the soul's origination, explain that the sūtra means to reject the Pañcaratra Tantras. Enough.

216: {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.45\.  

99\. The meaning of the {{sutras|sūtras}} is this. First the Author has set forth that the doctrines of Kapila, {{Kasyapa|Kaśyapa}}, Buddha, Jina and {{Pasupati|Paśupati}}, who oppose the Author's own accepted doctrine, are unnatural217 because they conflict with Revelation and logic. Now, in order to remove the suspicion that the {{Pancarãtra|Pāñcarātra}} Tantras (which are his own accepted {{doctine|doctrine}}) are equally unnatural with the other doctrines because their usual enumeration on an equal plane with the others has made them closely associated with them in people's thinking, he elicits their validity. In the first two {{sutras|sūtras}} the prima-facie case is laid down: the {{Pancarãtra|Pāñcarātra}} likewise has no validity, {{ulpallyasambhavat|utpattyasaṃbhavāt}}, i.e., on account of the impossibility of {{Sarıkarṣaṇa's|Saṅkarṣaṇa's}} origination which is taught there. Why should it be impossible? Because it cannot be established in either of two possible cases; either the four {{has|vyūhas}} are equally sovereign, or else one God exists in four persons; and in either case there is impossibility of origination. If they are equally sovereign, they cannot be created because they are equal; if only one being is admitted no origination is possible either, since a distribution within one being of creating and created parts is inconceivable.

217: In {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2,2\.  
218: {{asamañjasya|āsamañjasya}}, taken from {{BrS|BṛS}}., 2\.2\.37\.  

[[84]]

100\. Similarly na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}: {{Pañcarātra|Pāñcarātra}} has no validity for the further reason that it is impossible that the instrument, sc. the mind called Pradyumna, originates from the agent, sc. the individual soul called {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}}, for the hatchet does not originate from Devadatta. Or there is this alternative explanation of na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}: and for the further reason that the instrument does not originate from the agent {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}}, since according to the text: "From it spring the vital air, the mind and all the senses," it is revealed that all instruments really originate from Brahman.

101\. Then follows: {{vijñānādibhāre va tadapratisedhali|vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}. By the particle ca this prima-facie case is now reversed. What has been said, viz., that there is no validity since in neither case origination of {{Sankarṣaṇa|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} etc. is possible, is untrue: it is not contradictory that {{Samkarṣaṇa|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} etc. have originated. Indeed, it would be contradictory if they were not {{oijnanadi|vijñānādi}}. Vijñānādi is a dvandva compound: "knowledge and beginning," that means: Brahman; thus {{mijnānādibhāve|vijñānādibhāve}} means {{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}. Inasmuch as they are Brahman ({{brahmabhave|brahmabhāve}}), the origination is not contradictory. That is to say by virtue of the fact that the unique Supreme Soul Vāsudeva, whose omnipotence is unbounded, enters into them through His māyā, a cause-effect relation is justified. The objection that the mind cannot originate from {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}}, on the authority of the śruti that the mind originates from Brahman, is invalidated by the fact that he, sc. {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} is {{vijānadi|vijñānādi}}, i.e., Brahman.

[[85]]

102\. Furthermore, what is being said in the argument na ca {{kartuḥ karanam|kartuḥ karaṇam}}? Is it that the instrument of a certain action does not originate from the agent of that same action; or that no instrument of any action whatever originates from any agent whatsoever? If the first view is taken, we have a conflict with Inference, because the argument contains the fallacy of proving the proved. The mind, originating from the agent {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} cannot be the instrument of {{Samkarsana's|Saṅkarṣaṇa's}} action of originating it, since it itself is the object of the action; nor can it be the instrument of the action of being originated, since it itself is the agent of that action. If the alternative view is taken, we have a conflict with Perception, because we see that for instance a pitcher, though it be the instrument of an action of fetching water, yet originates from the agent of such an action, the potter. This the Author says in the {{sutra|sūtra}} {{vibratiṣedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}: 'because there is conflict.'

[[86]] AGAMA PRAMANYAN

103\. As to the other explanation that has been given of these two {{sutras|sūtras}},219 since it is {{vijanadi|vijñānādi}}, i.c. "a ground for validity",220 the denial of the validity of Pāñcarātra is not justified, because it entails overextension. The invalidity, which is defined by the non-origination of knowledge through repetition or dubiety in the Tantras, is rejected, because knowledge is actually had from them. In order to remove the suspicion of untruth occasioned by the speaker's character, the word {{adi|ādi}} is used to convey the intended meaning that the Tantras are in fact spoken by a trustworthy person. Consequently the meaning is this: He always has direct knowledge of the entire world by virtue of the omniscience which is part of His nature; He bestows man's wishes upon him, when He is satisfied—and he is satisfied by meditation alone; Him the experts in the Veda describe as eternally satisfied in all His desires: how then can there be defects in Him like error, deceit etc.?

219: supra §§96, 97\.  
220: i.e., as a {{fat purusa|tatpuruṣa}} compound "the beginning (source) of (valid) knowledge:" {{aijāānddibkor|vijñānādibhāvāt}} "since He (God) is a source of valid knowledge."  

104\. The 'impossibility of origination,' which has been stated in the first two {{sutras|sūtras}}, is thereupon denied for {{Samkarsana|Saṅkarṣaṇa}} and the other forms of God in the {{sutra|sūtra}} {{vipratisedhat|vipratiṣedhāt}}. This means either; "Because there is conflict with the Bhagavān's perception which is inferred through Pañcaratra;" or "Because there is conflict with {{Sruti|Śruti}} which is inferred from the same Tradition."

[[87]]

105\. Or there is another interpretation: since the {{sutras|sūtras}} intend to illustrate the rules of exegesis, the author first assumes that there is a conflict between Śruti and Pañcaratra, though in fact there is no such conflict, and then reasons this out as follows: suppose that Pañcaratra is in conflict with the veda, is this {{sastra|śāstra}} then, like the statements of Manu etc., valid or invalid? This question is thereupon answered: "It is invalid, because of the impossibility of the origination of valid knowledge concerning a conflicting sense; and this impossibility itself is proved on the ground that there is independence of something that is dependent." Thus the {{sutra|sūtra}} {{utpallyasambhavat|utpattyasaṃbhavāt}} means: "because it is impossible that a valid knowledge originates, since, as long as the dependent Pañcaratra Tradition does not start proving the validity of its own sense by establishing the validity of its basis, the cognition which originates from the independent {{preterpersonal|pre-personal}} scripture determines the Tradition's sense as being different, and consequently conflicting with itself. For Pāñcarātra conveys that scripture is its basis only as long as the sword of direct scripture does not cut its root.

106\. OBJECTION. But why should the Vedas themselves be independent, since their validity, too, depends on the direct cognition of the Bhagavān, because this cognition is their cause?221 Just as the Pāñcarātra Traditions are dependent on His cognition, so are the Vedas too dependent on His cognition.222

221: cf. supra § 18\.  
222: {{Karmani Lyu! Papini|Karmaṇi Lyuṭ Pāṇini}}.

{{RITUTATION|REFUTATION}}. To refute this view, the statement is made: na ca kartuḥ karaṇam: "The Vedas are not the product of a maker, i.e. the Bhagavān. {{Karana|Karaṇa}} here in the sense of "things that are made or produced," by the rule "suffix-{{aia|lyuṭ}} in the sense of the object of the action." This then means that the Vedas are {{preterhuman|pre-personal}}.

107\. {{Vijñānādibhrive vai tadapratised halt|Vijñānādibhāve vai tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}. If, on the other hand, it is not true that the {{Pañcaratra Sastra|Pāñcarātra Śāstra}} is invalid, then what? {{tadapratised hali|tadapratiṣedhaḥ}}, i e. non-rejection of the origination of valid knowledge (namely, even when partly conflicting, the conflicting statement may be valid optionally), because it is based upon the direct cognition of the Bhagavān in whom error and deceit are impossible as He is a source of vijñāna (vijñānādibhāve): Vijñāna means "knowledge par excellence in which no mistake is possible. For since all other authors of {{Dharmasastras|Dharmaśāstras}} are not omniscient, as they are involved in {{samsara|saṃsāra}}, and since therefore they are also not entirely selfsufficient, various lapses are {{con ceivable|conceivable}} in their knowledge. Whereas in the case of the Bhagavān, whose supremacy is natural and unlimited, His knowledge is the immediate insight in all dharma and adharma, which is natural to Him and true, as is known from hundreds of śrutis; it is this knowledge which in the {{sutra|sūtra}} is described as vijñāna, When such knowledge is the 'beginning,' i.e. the basis, there is non-rejection, sc. the {{Sastra|Śāstra}} is valid.
