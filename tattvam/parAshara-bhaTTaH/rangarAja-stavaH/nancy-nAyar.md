Śrīrangaraja Stava: The First 100 Stanzas 
1 
We recite the word "homage" 
to Śrīvatsacihna Miśra 
whose words attain [the position of] 
a marriage-thread 
[tied] around the neck of the Three Vedas! 
2 
Long live the one named Govinda 
who appears like a shadow at the feet of Rāmānuja 
never leaving him; 
whose essential nature is one of 
dependence upon that [Rāmānuja] and who is my resting-place! 
3 
Long live the sage Rāmānuja 
who with the weapon of devotion to Hari drove away the demon in the form of Kali [Yuga's] tumultuous play!

4 
We honour Yamuna 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
who removed from the Vedic path 
the thorn in the form of persons who argue unreasonably, and who in devotion to God is also [our] guide. 
5 
I praise the cloud named Nathamnuni who caused a rain of detachment 
knowledge of the reality of God and devotion [to fall] on the obstacle to devotion. 
6 
I cherish the seer [Śathakopa] 
who appeared like a personification of thirst for Kṛṣṇa 
and who saw by divine intuition the thousand-branched Tamil Veda. 
7 
Salutations to Śrīranga's beloved 
on account of the movement of whose eyebrows this world is divided 
into the ruler and the ruled 
and very insignificant persons 
are distinguished from great lords! 
8 
- 
I take refuge with the Splendorous One 
Who reclines in Srirangam an ornament on the breast of Sri shining in the lap of Anantabhoga just like the wish-fulfilling jewel. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 
9 
In the auspicious abode [at Srirangam] there exists an Entity transcending description 
as "this" or "that" 
having as its only distinguishing mark red decorative dye 
[imprinted] from the feet of Laksmi. 
10 
Let the big black bee that is Śrirangarāja 
moving to and fro around 
the flower-cluster raised breast of the desire-granting creeper Lakṣmi enjoy [Himself] in my lotus-like mind! 
11 
We passionately seek for a hundred autumns the blessing of Śrīrangarāja 
Whose chest has a makara-shaped mark 
made of musk 
imprinted from the breast of Śri. 
12 
May Srirangam's Leader 
Who perpetually carries five weapons 
being unable to bear [even a moment's] delay in the defence of His devotees 
protect us! 
13 
The Three Vedas declared that 
if not comprehended, He is comprehended if comprehended, He is not comprehended if praised He is defamed 
and if defamed He is praised. 

177 
178 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
How can we praise the King at [Śri]rangam? We just aren't able to do so! 
14 
If Rangacandra gives me 
the innate glory of having a thousand mouths then just like [the thousand-faced] Seşa 
or like [Vişņu, the thousand-faced Man] Himself I will take my part in the greatness of 
being powerless in praising Him. 
15 
Indeed, the Veda itself 
doubts whether the omniscient Lord Ranga [fully] comprehends Himself or not. 
[Such a view] is appropriate, 
for this very One 
covers His lordly eminence 
with my words which are dirtied by defects! 
16 
The One Who loves Śrirangam 
Who is Himself shining with songs of praise 
from the Sanskrit and Tamil Vedas 
dirties Himself with my words. 
[But then] who can prevent a freshly-bathed baby elephant from enjoying the dust? 
17 
What makes me offend You 
[by composing] this rash hymn of praise? 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 179 
Is it pride because of [my birth in] a royal lineage 
whose strength of surrender [to the Lord] enabled [our] entire family 
to cross over Viṣṇu-māyā, 
or is it because [as a baby] I was fondled at the feet of Rangaraja and Kamala? 
18 
The Veda does not hesitate to say that 
even the Lord Himself 
[though] shining with knowledge and speech cannot see the opposite side 
of His own great ocean. 
If that is the [Veda's ] consideration 
then let it be mine as well! 
Because of this, I have the right to compose a praise-poem to the One Who delights in Śrī. 
19 
You can steal from [Viṣṇu's] abundant [qualities] 
and use them to extol others 
but you can't do that to praise the Lord! 
Due to the boundlessness 
[of His auspicious qualities] 
it is impossible to praise Him! 
Even the limitless Vedas 
become like drops of rain in the ocean 
when they [try to] praise Hari. 
The ocean does not benefit 
from two drops of water falling into it, but by falling into the sea 
180 
Śrīrańgarāja Stava: Part I 
the [two drops of] water can profit from [the ocean's] good qualities. 
20 
Let me plunge into the [River] Kāverī a flawless flood of crystal-clear water 
overflowing to remove [all] obstructions to the enjoyment of God such as 
the causes and the fruits of karma and pain, which surrounds Srirangam in this world for [the benefit of] the creatures of samsara just like the [River] Virajā encircles this samsaric world with its trembling waters 
for the removal of obstacles 
to the Path beginning with Light. 
21 
May that Kaveri be honoured 
who [thinking] thus: 
"The Father is the Milk Ocean 
I [Kāveri] am the Mother 
Śri is our daughter 
Lord Sriranga is the bridegroom" 
[becomes confused as to] what worthy thing she can do for such [great] persons as these and overflows [her banks] 
carrying in her wave-like hands 
shining piles of pearls, giant gems, sandal, camphor, and whisks. 
22 
The River made of gold 
purifies the place of pilgrimage, protects the trees in the garden, wets the crossroads and streets, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 181 
carries water for drinking, worship, and bathing, purifies the bathers, 
reveals the secret of the Vedas 
Who is dark on the sand bank 
in the middle of the river, 
and with her foam crests appears to be laughing 
at the [River] Gangā 
who is roaring [with pride] 
because she has the feet of Viṣṇu as her birthplace. 
May that Kaveri wash away my sins! 
23 
Let [the river] that grows taller with the wind purify us! 
Having become a nurturer of the world 
she who is sweet, cool, deep, and ever awake overflows [her banks] just like 
the compassion of [Śri]rangam's Lord 
satisfying with her flood of waters all beings lacking any other remedy without even considering 
all their qualities and faults. 
24 
Filled with water containing nectar 
[from the flowers] of betel-nut and coconut trees 
and with bees sleeping in the flower-bunches 
belonging to the rows of trees on her bank 
swaying gently to and fro 
[rocked] by tiny rippling billows, 
may the river named "Golden" wash away my sin! 

182 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
25 
Honour the island surrounded by 
the sweet water of the Kāveri 
which covers the trunks of the banana,bakula, 
rose-apple, betel-nut, and mango trees clear up to their branches, 
whose thicket [of dark trees] gives the mistaken impression 
of a group of very thirsty clouds 
hanging down in the middle of the mighty waters! 
26 
They say that the Supreme Abode of Viṣṇu near the [River] Virajā 
a place free from tamas and rajas 
and perceptible only by liberated souls 
shines today as that holy island 
on the sand bank in the middle of the Kaveri. 
May I see [that island] always! 
27 
Let me live on Srirangam's holy garden slopes which have people learned in Vedānta, 
are visited by Vaiṣṇavas, 
remove the great troubles of this worldly existence and are served by the [River] Kāverī! 
28 
May [Śrirangam's lovely and pleasurable places dark with banana, jack-fruit and betel-nut trees nourished by a canal overflowing with sweet milk 
from the bunches of coconuts 
cracked open by jumping, glistening fish give [us] continual enjoyment! 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 183 
29 
They say that the city of the Supreme Heaven called Ayodhya and Aparājitā 
surrounded by the nectar [of the Virajā River] shines on the island [in the Kaveri River] as the capital city of King Ranga right before the eyes 
of even those with [only] ordinary sight! 
30 
King Ranga's capital city 
glittering with gem-studded rooftops and with rows of storied buildings which connect the two worlds 
shines brightly here 
as if to make even this transitory world a divine place. 
May it be victorious! 
31 
Having made the light rays 
[glittering] from the makara-shaped jewels 
on its decorative doorways 
into nets for Lakṣmi's new amusement, 
[Lord] Ranga's city 
with its hands in the form of fluttering flags 
shines brightly as if wishing 
to catch the deer on the moon. 
May it give us delight! 
32 
I salute the group of leaders beginning with Kumuda who 
endowed with weapons, attendants, and vehicles 

184 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
are ever watchful in protecting the prosperous city [of Srirangam] shining on the island in the river where [our] community [lives]. 
33 
They say that the eternally free souls 
who are by nature [the Lord's] servants, the liberated ones now freed from bondage, and those with pure and final bodies dwell eternally here [in Srirangam] 
in the form of great human persons animals and inanimate objects. 
Let there be salutations to them! 
34 
In this transitory world 
we take refuge in Śriranga's Divine Abode which 
surrounded by a group of gateways 
and rampart walls 
appears to be embraced by Garuda 
hidden in the hollow of his wings 
spread in devotion 
as if he has taken these various forms. 
35 
It appears as if the earth has approached the main sanctuary of [Lord] Ranga's Temple with her gem-filled mountains, oceans, and islands now manifest as compound-walls, 
verandahs, and halls. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 185 
36 
Let us prostrate before the groups of rampart 
and gem-studded halls 
built by the poet Parakāla 
in [Lord] Ranga's town, 
as if making Vedic 
the jewelled statues of the Jainas and their ilk 
who deny the authority of [the Vedas] 
and are defeated! 
walls 
37 
I salute Canda, Pracanḍa, and the others who 
enjoying [positions] of authority 
in the four gateways of [Śri]rangam 
with eyes and faces like blossoming lotuses 
purify the worshippers 
and with long teeth, maces, and frowns threaten the enemies 
[of the Lord and His devotees]! 
38 
May I reach the hall in the form of bliss so spacious that it is difficult to fill up even with the Lord's assembly common for all souls, described in the Upanisads by the words beginning with 
"the thousand-pillared [hall]". 
39 
We approach the moon-like lotus pond 
[named Candrapuṣkariņi] 
filled with blue lotuses useful as instruments 
for fighting and trading 
and as ornaments, umbrellas, and play-toys 

186 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part I 
in Hari's amusing diversions with Lakṣmi whose bank removes the tiredness 
resulting from [the Lord's] play 
with the Lotus-Lady 
in the lotus-minds of sages. 
40 
The moon obtained its quality 
of having [cool] nectar-like rays 
from its repeated connection with the excellence of the [lotus-pond's] sin-removing water. 
Having plunged into Candrapuṣkariņī, I will extinguish the three kinds of heat! 
41 
May the most excellent ten persons beginning with Parankusa 
take pity on me 
-- 
[those persons] who are well-seated 
to the East [of the lotus pond] 
who have the Lord immersed inside [their hearts] 
which are munificent, deep, clear and cool like Candrapuskariņi [itself]. 
42 
I must praise Śriranga's Abode well-situated on the lotus 
located on the earth's ocean 
which rests on the Serpent's expanded hood 
situated on the Tortoise 
who rests on the prakṛti maṇḍala 
which is placed on [Visnu's] supporting power. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 187 
43 
May I cherish the [Lord's] great shining palace 
not of human construction 
the treasury of Brahman called Aparājitā situated above the heavens in the city made of gold [and known] in this world 
by the name of Srirangam! 
44 
We trust in Srirangam 
a shelter whose glory equals hundreds of Śrutis and a spot where 
free from doubt and illusion 
one [can] see the Lord. 
Although fulfilling peoples' various desires, [Śrirangam's] sole intention 
is intimate union (with the Lord]; free from the defect. 
of human construction 
it is celebrated as beginningless! 
45 
May the holy central sanctuary thrill our eyes! [that vimana] which is none other than 
the lord of serpents 
who even though he is white 
[appears dark because he reflects] 
the emerald rays of Lord Ranga 
Who sleeps inside 
blacker than a black cloud which has drunk the water of the entire ocean! 

188 
46 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
I pray to the figure of the Man-Lion Who appears atop the temple gateway. 
Having made small His all-pervasive form 
because of motherly affection for His devotees, He crossed beyond all norms (in this incarnation] and was able to kill the enemy [Hiranya]! 
47 
A single light shines before me 
on one side clothed in the figure of a man and on the other charming with the form of a lion living perpetually atop the temple gateway 
[as if to say]: 
"I am enough support for people in distress”. 
48 
After I have taken refuge in the series of sidelong glances [emanating from] the gurus seated on the Lord's left side 
[those preceptors] who purify [the worshippers] by the casting of their holy and charming glances and make even one like me a fit offering to God, let me circumambulate 
[the Inner Sanctum of the temple]. 
49 
We celebrate the mastwood tree [whose flowers] plucked by Lakṣmi's own hand 
for ear ornaments 
from branches bent down by the hand of Śrīrangaraja possess their own divine perfume 

Praise-Poem to the King (of the Universe] at Śrirangam 189 
produced by the perpetual outpouring of [Sathakopa's] thousand songs. 
50 
Ignoring all else, we turned toward the army chief [Visvaksena] who 
having arranged for Rangacandra to pass away the time with Indirā has the authority to lead all sentient beings 
and insentient matter 
solely by the gesture of his hand. 
51 
I approached Mother Sūtravati 
the Army Chief [Viṣvaksena's] wife whose beautiful creeper-like arms shine with a serving cloth 
marked with red decorative dye [imprinted] from the feet of Śri. 
52 
Eagerly engaged in protecting Srirangam 
on all sides 
night and day 
and a forest fire to the obstacles 
in the form of grass [along the path] of those who approach [the Lord] in this transitory world, 
may Visvaksena's chief servants 
Karimukha, Jayatsena, 
Kālāhva, and Simhamukha give us happiness. 
190 
53 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
We take shelter with the embodiment of Śruti whose face blooming with modesty 
and excessive happiness 
resembles an auspicious mirror of precious gems. 
Upon seeing His own essential form, nature, 
and majesty [reflected there] 
the One reclining in [Śrī]rangam rejoices! 
54 
I honour Sukirti along with Rudrā Garuda's two consorts who 
[seated on either side of him] look like his two wings. 
Through these two 
may Kamalā bless her suppliants with fame and tears of joy. 
55 
We praise the group of five warriors each of whom [wears] a crown 
shining with the form of his own weapon which causes the gods to tremble [with fear] 
by the threatening hand gesture 
not to make noise. 
Eyes red from lack of sleep, they are ever awake 
(protecting] the Lord's slumber 
by wandering about [guarding the temple]. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 191 
56 
I take refuge with [Viṣṇu's] discus [Sudarsana] 
of weapons 
leader of the group 
whose body 
stained from the cutting of demons 
bears a circle of flames spinning around and around 
delightful because 
its extraordinary dance of drunkenness 
is caused by the Lord's honey-wine glances! 
57 
May I belong to Hanuman and Vibhīṣaṇa who 
having abandoned Final Liberation 
[remain here and] thus gladden 
the Treasure of [Śri]rangam 
Who is the Raghu Chief's equivalent in this world. 
58 
I [now] proceed to the bamboo cane 
which directs us away from ordinary objects to that endlessly enjoyable person (Śrīrangarāja). 
Now let my five senses 
which may be turned toward other things 
when outside of this [temple] 
be subject inside [its Inner Sanctumn] 
to that which is right before them! 
59 
We approach the pair of fragrant pillars 
useful as a support for people staggering about 
bewildered by the speed 
of the nectar-stream of sidelong glances 
[flowing out from the eyes of] 
the One Who reclines on Sesa. 

192 
60 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
May we see Śrirangam's Inner Sanctum which 
holding the shining Seşa 
and the beautiful bridegroom of Śri and Bhūmi resembles an open jewelry-box 
containing Śri's divine ornaments. 
61 
We praise [the ladies] 
who hold in the fingertips of their hands daggers and creepers used for play 
and small golden vessels and spitoons 
whose breasts are adorned 
with serving cloths 
and who massage the lotus-feet 
[of Śri and Bhūmi]. 
62 
May I honour also the nine [ladies] 
beginning with Vimalā 
who resemble a beautiful moon-lit night 
with one hand like a closed lotus blossom 
[placed] on the head saluting [God] 
and the other [holding] a chowrie [used] for serving [the Lord]. 
63 
Here [in the Inner Sanctum] may I approach Srirangaraja Who is like a pool filled with fully-bloomed lotuses and those at His right and left -- 
Laksmi 
who delights in playing like a royal white swan 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 
and the Earth [Goddess] 
who resembles [Śrī's] growing shadow. 
193 
O eye! 
64 
Drink in this pool of blossoming lotuses named the Foremost One of [Srirangam [present] right before you 
[in the Inner Sanctum]. 
Look also at Laksmi 
who is playing in this [pond] 
like a royal swan 
and at [Bhumi], the sustainer of all the worlds, 
who looks like her reflection. 
65 
We have plunged into a rainy-season's 
lush lotus pond 
that is Śrīrangarāja 
naturally deep, clear and bright, 
made fragrant by Lakṣmi, 
and cool with gracious condescension 
like the billows of His boundless compassion 
in which the whole [world] bathes. 
66 
Let me enjoy [Śrirangarāja] 
proud because of the richness of His youthfulness, 
auspiciousness, and beauty 
made fruitful by his own choice 
of Laksmi [as consort] 
Who sits on the throne along with Śrī and Kṣama 

194 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
in order to bring the entire world under one umbrella 
and Who is my very life! 
67 
Without a moment's interruption may we enjoy Śrīraṁgarāja 
Who creates affection in the hearts of all people by the features of His body 
overflowing with friendliness and autonomy shining brightly from His feet 
up to His jewelled crown! 
68 
In the prime of youth 
rising up in ten directions, 
playfully embracing the desire-granting creepers 
that are the Earth [Goddess] and 
the [Lady] who lives in the lotus, covered with leaves and bent down with fruits in the form of boons according to each person's desire, let the heavenly boon-bestowing tree 
known as the Splendour of [Śrī]rangam take away my tiredness. 
69 
May I reach my Auspicious Refuge 
the Munificent One Who dwells in [Srirangam Who is as if speaking to me with His glance 
and His gentle, sweet smile 
attractive to everyone 
Whose four arms are blossoming with the divine weapons. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 195 
70 
Let the One in Srirangam 
Who is capable of bearing all things 
bear my 
burden -- 
He Who seems to be saying with his smiling face 
and revealing by His hand 
positioned in a gesture of fearlessness: 
"Oh people, these hands of mine 
which carry a conch, a mace, 
and [the discus named] Sudarsana bless [you]. These two feet of mine are 
your refuge, security, and blessing". 
71 
Oh how can I understand 
[Śri]rangam's Foremost One Who 
with limbs perfumed 
with the pride of youth's prime 
resembles the heavenly boon-bestowing tree 
which has hundreds of newly-spreading branches offering themselves [to the devotees as if to say]: "[Enjoy] me first, [enjoy] me first"? 
72 
O Ornament of Śrirangam! 
Your tender-hearted sidelong glances, 
Your words and gentle smile 
the master [of all] because of its charm 
provide shade [for people in the heat of samsara]. 
Your body is the heart's goal 
of [the Lady] who lives in the lotus 
and your movements [are pleasing] to the eyes. 

196 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part I 
All these [thoughts] are fragrant with a youthfulness that makes tender our hearts. 
What more [could we desire]? 
73 
We worship Lord Ranga Who has a tall crown, an urdhvapuṇḍra mark shining on His forehead, long eyes reaching to His 
beautiful long and flawless ears, 
a well-developed chest, 
hands holding the [divine] weapons, a celebrated waist-cloth 
and lotus-feet. 
74 
Everywhere in Srirangam for a hundred years may we see Lakṣmi's husband Who has lotus-feet placed on the lotus-[seat], 
a silken cloth fit to His curved hips, a body-posture touched with the fragrance of the dance, a natural and gentle smile, 
a lotus-face touching His crown 
and divine weapons resting in His hands. 
75 
We shelterless ones take refuge with 
Rangaraja Who presents Himself for all [to see] Who has a bird [Garuda] in front of Him 
and is Himself reclining behind 
on the lord of serpents Whose face with its gentle smile 
[pours forth] a flood of nectar being enjoyed without saturation 
11 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 
by the deep eyes of Śri and Bhumi who are on either side [of Him] 
with His hands in a gesture inviting fearlessness, 
shining with mace, conch, and discus. 
76 
May we take shelter with 
the Lord at Srirangam 
a refuge for persons who 
wish to recover lost wealth 
a boon-bestowing tree to people who 
desire new things 
the place of patience for the those who 
commit unbearable offences 
and a cow of plenty for those who approach [Him] spontaneously and for whom He is all. 
He is our wealth 
Kamala's eye 
and Bhumi's life. 
May He bring joy in Śrirangam 
for a long long time 
and make me His servant. 
77 
Bowed down before a couch-swing formed by the lord of serpents 
which is moving to and fro [rocked] 
by the slow breathing in and breathing out [of Adiseṣa] 
who is proud to be holding Rangam's wealth 

197 
198 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
sleeping happily 
on his fragrant, soft, bright coils which resemble a beautiful garland 
surounded by the splendour of a canopy composed of jewels shining out from Seşa's expanded hood, 
we are revived! 
78 
May I worship the Supreme Person the remover of the troubles of the devotees and the bestower of boons 
featured with broad arms and long eyes 
Who reclines [here] in the Abode of [Śrī]rangam 
which is none other than 
the banyan leaf 
the womb of Devaki 
the pinnacle of the Vedas 
the breast of Kamalā 
and the speech of Saṭhakopa. 
79 
May the Supreme Person think of us! [He] Whose eyes throb 
from the heavy and regular 
breathing in and breathing out of the excellent lord of serpents. 
Having forgotten the [Milk] Ocean and the Supreme Heaven, 
He sleeps the sleep (nidrā) 
that is interchangeable with 
the [Lady] who lives among the lotuses [Nidrā] in the place called Srirangam. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 199 
I salute the Person 
80 
with lotus-like feet, hands, and eyes Who reclines on a serpent 
in the dark abode [of the Inner Sanctumn]. 
Black in colour, He looks like 
an ocean drunk by a cloud a mountain placed in the sea or an elephant sleeping 
in the bushes of a mountain. 
81 
May the One sleeping here in Srirangam Who possesses corals in the form 
of His reddish lips, feet, and palms and resembles a profound, wonderful baby-ocean 
fondled by [its mother's] hands 
in the form of the Kaveri's waves 
delight us here in this world. 
82 
Resembling a cool black rain-cloud 
because He is filled with the waters of compassion, 
bearing the bow of Indra 
in the rays of brightness 
[shining out from] His jewelled ornaments, 
and having Indira as lightning, 
may the One sleeping on a mountain 
in the Srirangam Abode 
rain on me. 
83 
We drink in with our eyes once again as if He is a flood of ambrosia 
200 
flowing into the minds 
of those who see Him 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
the One with long, gentle and attractive limbs 
Who sleeps on Seşa 
with the splendour [of every part of His body] 
growing greater and greater 
from His makara-shaped crown jewel clear down to His feet! 
Rangacandra 
84 
Who acquires the quality of a lotus 
because of His feet, hands and face, the beauty of green trees 
by the loveliness of His limbs, 
and the quality of a red flower blossom 
by his lips, 
resembles an eternal divine garden for [the delight of] Śri. 
85 
Radiant from rejoicing in each other, the divine garland of forest flowers, 
waist-cloth, ornaments, and fragrant unguents on [the Lord's] body 
incomparably beautiful 
because they are in the form of cit 
have bristled with rapture 
from the touch [of His body] 
and thereby increase 
the Moon of [Śri]rangam's abundant splendour! 
86 
A multitude of emerald rays 
advancing themselves like waves spreading out from an ocean 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 201 
mixed with a mountain of molten gold in the form of the One Who reclines on Sesa wash over this person 
and remove his [inner] darkness! 
87 
The Leader of [Śrī]rangam's delightful fragrance perfumed by His supreme lordship 
[obtained through His] eternal embrace of Śri and augmented by the sweet scent 
of the breathing of the king of serper.ts has overflowed the limit in all directions and causes the minds [of His devotees] to sink into an abundance of bliss! 
88 
The tenderness [Śri]rangani's Protector 
that causes us to record 
even the very mention of our looking at Him in the lists of rash 'actions 
and which accounts for His name "Puṣpahāsa” transcends our speech and mind. 
O foolish eye! 
89 
Don't engage in useless doubts [thinking] thus: 
"How will I see [and hence enjoy] all of Him [at once] 
[when I am completely] immersed 
in the boundless beauty 
of each and every one of His parts?" 
The very loveliness

[the enjoyment of] all [of Him] at once!

The eternal youthfulness 
of the Moon of Rangam's body like the season of the appearance 
of the boon-bestowing tree's first bloom, honey which intoxicates all the senses 
of the bees that are Kṣamā and Lakṣmi, the blossoming of a garland of beauty, and a vessel of delicious intoxicating liquor makes fragrant [our] good fortune. 
91 
Revealing His imperial lordship, the row of jewels [shining] 
on the crown and diadem 
of the One Who is fond of Śrī 
resembles waves of splendour 
spreading upward from the moon of His face. 
92 
We consider Lord Ranga's gem-studded crown 
the top of which gleams with 
a makara-shaped ruby 
diffusing the light of the crest jewel 
in all directions 
a lovely [mountain] pleasure garden high and broad for the glory of the Emperor cit and acit. 
We think of the crest gems as a ridge surrounding that garden.

May the face 
93 
of the One Who is fond of Śri 
which destroys the pride of 
nectar-pool, moon, or lotus 
and is luminous with crest jewel and forehead curl 
tilaka, ūrdhvapuṇḍra mark, 
and a pure, beautiful and gentle smile 
roam about in me for enjoyment. 
94 
Lord Ranga's pearl-surrounded tilaka ornaments [resemble] lotus filaments above 
His three-lined lotus-like face. 
His forehead curls 
bear the beauty of bees 
approaching that [lotus-face]. 
95 
Lord Ranga's urdhvapuṇḍra mark is so lovely and sweet 
that I am confused as to whether it is 
[a forehead mark] 
or a stream of ambrosia flowing out from 
the half-moon of His forehead. 
96 
Lord Ranga's eyebrows flash forth 
moving in amorous dance above His eyes 
like two rows of big black bees facing downwards 
dancing in drunkeness 
above two lotus-blossoms.

When Lord Ranga's eyes are mistaken for the god of love's lotus-flower arrows His eyebrows 
splendorous like sugarcane bows 
bent over His eyes 
shine [with pride] like a gurukula of the glory of His dancing [bow named] Śarriga. 
98 
[The devotees] know that at the outset 
the two eyes of the Leader of [Śrī]rangam 
were so long that they spread clear up to His ears. 
With supreme compassion 
His entire body is going to change 
completely and in all ways 
into eyes! 
99 
Broad, large, long and lovely, cool white [streaked] with light red, swinging clear up to the obstruction 
of His ears and nose, 
and charming like a pair of glistening fish 
fighting with each other, darting [here and there], 
may the lotus-eyes of Srirangam's Beloved 
take pity on me. 
100 
O Wealth of [Śrirangam! 
Overflowing their banks 
with the nectar of compassion 
and welcoming the ones who have bowed down, let fall upon me

rows of billows from Your river-like eyes 
which are clear, cool 
and spread up to Your ears. 
101 
The nose of the One 
Who makes His abode in [Śrī]rangam 
shines like a lovely young desire-yielding creeper. 
His smile resembles 
that [creeper's] fresh flower, 
and His cheeks and chin 
glitter like its tender leaves sprouting forth. 
102 
Out of anger at being caught 
in the net of His ears 
and at being struck 
by the glittering fish of His eyes, 
the great makara-shaped gem-studded earrings moving to and fro near the shore 
of [the Lord's] shoulders 
which have moss-like plants 
in the form of hair curls hanging down on all sides of 
the nectar-ocean-like Leader of Rangam's [face], 
[appear to be] ejecting lustre 
in the form of bunches of flower blossoms! 
103 
May the pool that is the Moon of [Śrirangam's

makaras for earrings 
and a border of black forest for rows of curls remain in me forever. 
104 
May the Leader of Śrīrangam's neck 
give me delight! 
[that neck] which robs the beauty of 
[the three-lined] conch and 
the tender trunk of a stately betel-nut tree, 
glittering as if its [three] lines 
have been playfully imprinted from the golden bracelets 
belonging to the banana-stem arms 
of Laksmi and Bhumi 
who are embracing [Him] with love. 
105 
May the Beloved One of Rangam's powerful arms bestow fearlessness upon me, 
[those arms that are] 
supporting pillars 
for the world's expansive cosmic plan 
posts to which the female elephant Kamalā is tied pestles for destroying the elephant-herd of enemies 
and a cause of confusion [as to which is which] 
when joined together 
with the Serpent King and the flourishing garland.

We worship 
106 
the long and ever generous arms of Śriranga Who out of eagerness [to see] Vibhīṣaṇa 
reclines on the shore facing the ocean 
with one arm extended as if to honour him again and the other placed like a pillow 
on the Serpent Chief. 
107 
We approach the arms of Ranga Who 
free from [all] troubles 
sleeps soundly on the Serpent. 
Placed on a raised crystal platform, [those arms] 
which have tender new leaves 
in the form of many-jewelled rings 
golden bracelets, and armlets and are bent from bearing 
an abundance of flower blossoms, appear to be laughing at the branches 
of the heavenly boon-bestowing tree. 
108 
They resemble two kautaka threads in their resolution to protect me; 
they reveal [the Lord's] bravery 
by the rough scars made by His bracelets and the bowstring [named] Śārnga; 
they allured Kamala with a smoothness 
that she mistook 
for that of a beautiful garland and, 
[becoming] a pillow for her amusing play, are imprinted with her curls. 

208 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
The arms of the One Who adheres to Śrīrangam excel [all others]. 
109 
I take refuge with the lotus-hand of the One Who sleeps in Srirangam 
which seems [to be] directing 
persons afflicted by the heat [of samsāra] to the nectar-pool of His face. 
His face appears to indicate that this hand, used by Him as a pillow, 
and red with [jealous] anger toward the lotus clusters 
[that compete with it in loveliness] is itself the bestower of boons. 
110 
Made into a pillow 
by the One Who reclines in Śrīrangam, one arm touched His crown and says: 
"This crown is fit for Him 
because of His lordship over Brahma and Siva". 
The other arm, touching the knees, reaches toward His lotus-feet and proclaims: 
"[These feet] are the chief refuge of the lowly". 
111 
I adore Ranga's all-forbearing chest 
anointed with sandal paste and camphor -- Lakşmi's house of play with its 
jasmine garland for a bed, 
jewels for a canopy, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 209 
kaustubha gem for an auspicious lamp, and marks made by the bull-like demon 
[Ariṣṭa's] horns for pictures. 
112 
May we look upon 
the Resident of [Srirangam's chest 
which has the greatness of the ocean churned with Mount Mandara, 
is wonderful because of its boundless opulence 
manifesting the kaustubha gem, Lakṣmi 
and a multitude of jewels spreading here and there 
rich because it possesses 
blossoming garlands for foam, 
rows of bright rays for lines of waves, 
and is cloudy with strings of pearls for mist. 
113 
[Resting] on the chest of [Srirangam's Splendour, the holy garland [of basil], Kamalā, 
the kaustubha jewel, and Vaijayanti clearly exhibit His lordliness over all. 
So be it! 
What really delights us is 
the contemplation of the string 
containing [Vişnu's] five weapons 
joined with the nails of a turtle and tigress tied [around Kṛṣṇa's waist] by Yasoda as an ornament of childhood!

Srirangarāja Stava: Part I 
The All-pervasive One's stomach seems emaciated because of [His continuing] dissatisfaction [expressed] thus: 
"How great a burden 
can the earth and the group of Cosmic Eggs be for me?" 
So the lotus from His navel 
is creating yet another series of worlds 
[more] fit [for fulfilling] His desire to protect. 
115 
The three lines appearing 
on the great Lord Ranga's belly which seem to be counting the three kinds of cit and acit reveal His sovereignty [over all]. 
The mark that gives Him the name Damodara declares that He is under the control 
of His devotees. 
His waist-cord is like an edict bound [around Him in order to show His greatness] 
both [as Controller and Controlled]. 
116 
Refuting illogical arguments 
that the three gods are equal 
the three gods are one and inseparable 
the Supreme Reality is greater than the three gods, the lotus from the navel of the All-pervasive Lord 
the primary cause 
of [gods such as] Brahma and Rudra 
establishes the real truth for us that all things other than That One 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrīrangam 211 
are dependent upon 
the contraction of His eyebrows [for their very existence]. 
117 
The navel on the ocean that is 
the One Who makes His home in [Śri]rangam 
which keeps all the worlds inside itself 
in order to protect them 
surely wishes to be like a sinking whirlpool. 
The navel-lotus which brings out those [worlds as if trying] to see [them] 
becomes a rising whirlpool. 
118 
What can be compared 
to the Elephant of Rangam's two thighs 
so swollen with pride 
at having surpassed [in beauty] 
the insolence of a banana stem 
a gracefully tapering hand 
and an elephant's trunk 
that they seem as if they have just now subdued the arrogance of Madhu and Kaitabha? 
119 
The golden garment of [Śri]rangam's Friend with a jewelled belt-ornament put around it and glittering with a knot well-suited 
to the beauty of His waist 
shines like the gem-filled slope of [Mount] Meru licked by a huge cloud. 

212 
120 
Our mind drinks in 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
the Leader of [Śri]rangam's golden garment bright like the halo of ocean 
surrounding the Golden Land 
and a chain of lightning [flashing] in the sky 
amidst a cluster of clouds at dusk. 
121 
I think that the loveliness belonging to the limbs of the One Who makes His lofty abode 
in auspicious Rangam -- 
immersed in the splendour 
of His ornaments spreading on all sides and in a state of intoxication -- 
has become transformed at one place into His pair of knees. 
The two shins 
122 
of the One who reclines in Srirangam 
which experience horripilation 
from the thrill [felt] 
during their massage by Śri and Bhūmi 
rival in loveliness a pair of fleshy lotus stems on account of [the goddesses'] 
amorous amusement. 
123 
Let me meditate on and praise the lotus-feet 
of [Srirangam's Protector 
which have a redness seemingly reflected from the row of crowns 
belonging to the gods 
bowing down [before them], from the minds of yogis, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrīrangam 213 
or from [their massage 
by] the two hands of Kamalā. 
124 
The master of Bṛndāvana which learned to dance 
to the [musical] sound of the churning of curds, 
the foot of the One Who delights in Śri 
is a witness to the happiness of Lakṣmi's hands, 
has an excellence rivaling the lotus, 
does not discriminate among the devotees 
be they high or low, 
and is fond of its role as messenger. 
May that most excellent foot of Viṣṇu bless us. 
125 
I worship the lotus-feet 
of the One Who sleeps in Śrirangam beautiful with marks of the thunder-bolt, 
lotus, flag, umbrella, boon-granting tree, conch, diamond, discus, and mirror 
and with the tinkling sounds 
of His jewelled toe-rings; 
they are [the embodiment] of Śruti 
which again and again reveal by their sovereignty His victory beginning with the three strides 
[taken to measure the worlds]. 
126 
Let us dive day and night 
into the splendour of the toenails of the One Who delights in Śri which are a fresh cluster of blossoms

of His feet 
and are a cause of confusion as to whether 
[they are really His nails] 
or a row of Gangā billows flowing out from all His toes 
[making the sound] "swish, swish" 
as if to say: 
"I [the Gangā], 
spreading in many different directions, will purify all the worlds."

I salute the Moon of [Śri]rangam's feet 
lovely like two closely placed tender leaves [decorated] with golden lotuses 
offered by Rāma and Sītā 
which [cause me] confusion 
as to whether they are [lotuses] 
or the faces of Brahma 
bowed down before Him in daily worship, and which wear blue-jewelled tinkling anklets surpassing [in beauty] blue lotuses 
with swarms of big black honey-sipping bees clinging to their flower-stems. 
NOTES 
"Marriage-thread" (mangala-sūtra) is "a thread tied by the 
bridegroom around the bride's neck, and worn as long as the husband lives" (M-W, 773). 
This sloka is the official guruparampara verse for Empar, known also by the name Srīgovinda Dasar, Rāmānuja's im- mediate disciple and Bhaṭṭar's Acarya. Empār belonged to the same Brahmin subsect (Vatama) as did his Acārya and

his disciple. He is reported never to have married, and is said to have composed one non-extant work called Vijñāna Stuti (PTA, 584). 
"Long live [Govind]" or "May [Govind] live long" (jiyāt) is a common blessing in Sanskrit literature. Note, however, that the style is also that of the Tamil pallantu. The phrase "May you live long..." is found in each and every verse of Periyalvar's Tiruppallantu. 
The reference to Yamuna's "removing the thorn from the Vedic path in the form of the persons who argue unreason- ably" is more than likely a reference to his defence of the au- thoritativeness of the Pañcarātra Agamas entitled Agama Prāmāṇyam. 
Bhattar describes Nammālvār as a seer (rși), thus connecting him with the inspired ṛṣis to whom the Vedas were re- vealed. 
"Tamil Veda" (drāviḍīm brahma-samṁhitām). Brahma means "the sacred word, the Veda, a sacred text"; samhita means "conjunction, connection, union...a text treated according to euphonic rules (esp. the real continuous text of the Vedas as formed out of the Padas or separate words by proper phonetic changes....any methodically arranged collection of texts or verses)" (M-W, 737 and 1123). This verse is part of the official Srivaisnava guruparampară. This verse is part of the official Srivaisnava guruparampara. Note the reversal imagery. Ordinarily, Sri is imaged as an ornament on the chest of Nārāyaṇa. In this verse, however, He is said to be "an ornament on the breast of Śri". Compare with KUp, v. 1: "It is known to him to whom It is unknown; he does not know to whom It is known. It is unknown to those who know well, and known to those who do not know" (Eight Upanisads 1957: 51). 
Although ninda-stuti is found in the Veda, to my knowl- edge there is no "praise-defamation" passage similar to the one in this verse. The reference, therefore, would appear to be to the Tamil Veda of the Alvars. See, for example, Nammālvār, PTAnt, v. 2, in which praise is said to be abuse, and abuse is said to indicate respect.

Bhattar calls the Lord at Srirangam Rangacandra in this and several other stanzas, perhaps playing on Lord Sriranga's special association with Lord Rama, Who is often lovingly called Rāmacandra. 
The image of "the Person with a thousand heads" is from PSū. 
As in v. 14, the idea expressed here -- that even Nārāyaṇa is unable to praise Himself adequately -- is based on the sug- gestion that God cannot fully know Himself: "The Lord of the universe who lives in the Great Sky knows Himself, or perhaps even He does not know" (TaittBrāh 2.8.9). "With songs of praise from the Sanskrit and Tamil Vedas" (samskṛta-drāviḍa-veda-sūktaiḥ). The term sūkta is used by Bhaṭṭar to indicate a form of Vedic praise in BhGD, No. 693. 
"surrender" (prapatti). The connection of surrender with the crossing of Viṣṇu-māyā is based on BhG 7.14-15: "This māyā of Mine, composed of the three guņas, is difficult to cross...those who take refuge with/surrender to Me alone (māmeva ye prapadyante) cross beyond this māyā”. 
Bhattar's reference to being "fondled at the feet of Ran- garaja and Kamalā (Śrī)" would appear to be the origin of the later story found in all major Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographical texts, which identify Parāśara Bhattar as the son of Śrī- rangarāja. Note, however, that he refers to himself as the son of Śrīvatsacihna Miśra (Kūresa) in v. 1. 
"Path beginning with Light" (arcirādi-sarani). For Rāmā- nuja's exposition of arcirādi-mārga, see ŚrīBh IV. 4.1. Praise of the Kaveri River by way of poetic description is a common feature in the DP. For an example containing im- agery identical to that in this verse see Kulacekara Alvar, Pmā!TM 1.1, in which the river is described as touching Lord Ranga's feet with her "wave-like hands” (tiraikkaiyāl). See also Tirumańkai Āļvār's PTM 5.4.9, in which the Kāveri's waters are described as bringing pearls and pre- cious gems (muttum maniyum). 
The name "Golden River" or "River made of gold" (hemāpaga) is a direct translation from the well-known Tamil name of the Kāverī River, Ponni. This name fre-

quently appears both in the DP and in Cōla inscriptions. See, for example, Kulacekara Āļvār, PmāļTM 1.1. "She...who is ever awake" (anujagrātī) is a phrase usually used to describe a mother who remains awake in order to watch over her baby. It is used in this verse to express the ever-vigilant, motherly compassion of God. "the river named "Golden" (kanaka-nāmnīnimnagā). See v. 
22. 
Many of the Ālvārs describe Śrirangam as being in or surrounded by a garden. For nature imagery similar to that contained in this stanza, see PĀTM 2.9.10: "Arankam is... in a garden buzzing with intoxicated bees". See also 3.3.2, 4.8.4 and 4.8.5. 
Ayodhya is described as "the city of the gods" and as "a city surrounded by eternally free souls" in Arthva Veda 10.2. 31. "Ayodhya is the city of the gods. It has a treasury filled with gold. Brahma entered the city made of gold which is known as Aparajita" (puram hiraṇmayīm viveśa aparājitā ityādi brahmā) (Taittiriya Aranyaka 1.27, quoted in Bhaṭṭar's BhGD, No. 71). 
The tall, many-storied buildings of Śrirangam are a popular image with the Alvars. For example, see Tirumankai Aļvār, PTM 5.4.7, in which the tall buildings of Srirangam are said to touch the clouds. 
"Deer on the moon" refers to the spots on the moon which are thought by Hindus to resemble a deer or an antelope. In the stanzas which follow, Bhattar follows the customary route to reach the Inner Sanctum. As a reverent devotee, he salutes each of the icons dwelling in the shrines along the 
way. 
As in YMD 8.24, the liberated souls depicted by Bhattar have the power to roam all over the worlds (see also ŸMD 1.4). In this authoritative text, those desirous of liberation are listed in the category of the "bound" (baddha) even though they live "as if liberated". Bhattar, on the other hand, puts them in the category of the "eternals". See Nayar 1981 for a discussion of the concept of "as if liberated". "central sanctuary" (vimana); "compound walls, verandas and halls" (prakāra-madhya-ajira-maṇḍapa).

According to a famous hagiographical story, Parakala (Tiru- mankai Alvar) stole an image from Nagapatnam and the money it brought in was used for the construction of one of the rampart walls of the Srirangam Temple. For the full story, see GPP 1975:81-82. 
Usually Śrīvaiṣṇava temples have only two doorkeepers (or gatekeepers), but Śrirangam Temple has eight. The gate- keepers of the East are Canda and Pracanda, of the South are Bhadra and Subhadra, of the West are Jaya and Vijaya, and of the North are Dhatṛ and Vidhatṛ (Hari Rao 1967: 101-102). It is necessary to get their permission (by saluting) to enter into the temple. Because Bhattar salutes Canda and Pracanda, we know that he has entered the temple through the East door. 
"Common for all souls" (sarvātma-sādharana) refers to the fact that the Lord takes to Himself not just people of great merit, but all persons who surrender to Him. 
The "thousand-pillared hall" of the Srirangam Temple is modeled on the one in Vaikuntha, described in Tavakara Upanisad: "the Lord of the gods, Nārāyaṇa, sits in the thousand-pillared [hall]" (sahasra-sthune). 
Candrapuşkariņi is a small circular tank near the main part of the Srirangam Temple. To its west is a large pipal tree and a pillared verandah (Hari Rao 1967: 42-3). During the final day of the Brahmotsava festival, Śrīrangarāja is taken in procession outside the temple, and when he returns Śri and Bhūmi look for signs of his having been with another woman. The scene, acted out in the temple, includes a lovers' quarrel in which Srirangaraja and Sri fight with flowers gathered from the lotus pond. 
For "the three kinds of heat", see VRS, v. 72. 
This verse refers to the icons of the Alvars situated around the central shrine of Srirangaraja, evidence to the fact that this shrine existed at the time of Bhaṭṭar. "the supporting power" (ādhāra-śakti). 
The imagery in this stanza is taken from the directions for meditation during the performance of worship (pūjā-vidhi) according to Pañcaratra. Bhaṭṭar deals with the same topic in BhGD in the section relating to the epithets of Kurma or

See n. 29. 
"intimate union [with the Lord]" (sāyujya). See $VS, n. 
42. 
The phrase "who crossed all norms" refers to Narasimha's extraordinary pecularities among the avataras of Viṣṇu. He had the body of a man but the head of a lion; even more ex- traordinary was his emergence from a pillar. "Mastwood tree" (punnaga; Tamil, punnai) "a tree with beautifully scented flowers, calophyllum inophyllum" (MTL, V, 2814). Śrīvaiṣṇava scholars meet underneath this tree on the banks of Candrapuşkariņî even today for their theological discussions, including oral commentary on Nammālvār's TVM. 
"The gesture of his hand" (anguli-mudra) refers to that po- sition of the hand in which the final three fingers are bent and the index finger is pointed up; it is said to be the means by which Visvaksena controls the world. 
A "serving cloth" (prota) is used by Sūtravati to touch up and dry the decorative marks which she applies to Śrī's feet. Alternative names for three of the four servants of Vişvaksena are: Gajanana (Karimukha), Kālaprakṛti (Kālāhva), and Harivaktra (Simhamukha). They are mentioned under these alternative names in Ramanuja, NG. They are saluted -- both in the temple and in the home pūjā ceremony -- before approaching Visnu-Nārāyaṇa in order to remove any obstacles blocking the path of His devotees. This stanza praises the Lord's attendant and vehicle Garuda, who is regarded as an embodiment of the Veda. The origins of this idea are to be found in Yajurveda Samhita 12.4, in which the various parts of his body are described as corre- sponding to the various divisions of the Veda. 
Yamuna's SR, v. 41, says that Garuda is "composed of the Three [Vedas]" (trayi-maya). Bhattar's stanza contains the wording śruti-maya. 
The consorts of Garuda are found only in the temple at Śrirangam (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkat- achari, April 1987).

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
Note the play on words: Sukirti gives fame (kirti) and Rudra (which means "the crier") gives "tears of joy” (harṣa- vāṣpa). 
"Group of five warriors" lit. "five weapons" is a reference to the personifications of the Lord's weapons. 
Compare this verse with PĀTM 5.1.9, in which the author addresses the weapons of the Lord, telling them to perform their duty of protecting Him, with the words "Don't sleep! don't sleep! don't sleep!” (uraka! uraka! urakal). 
"the threatening hand gesture" (tarjani-mudra). 
57 Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe that Hanuman and Vibhiṣaṇa refuse 
liberation in Vaikuntha so that they might serve Srirangaraja in Srirangam. Whenever there is a public reading of the Rāmāyaṇa, an empty seat is reserved in the front row for Hanuman, who, it is believed, comes to listen to the story of Lord Rama.

Even today a bamboo cane is placed across the entrance to the inner part of the Inner Sanctum of the Srirangam Temple so that only rightful persons may approach the temple icon. There are four golden pillars just outside the inner part of the Inner Sanctum of the Srirangam Temple. Standing be- tween two of them, you have a direct view of the face of Śrirangaraja. 
This verse is based on Kulacēkara Āļvār, PmāļTM 1.2, in which the poet asks when, holding onto the two pillars (maṇattūņē), he can praise Lord Mayon Who sleeps on the serpent couch. 
"Beautiful bridegroom" (ramya-jāmātṛ) is a translation from Kulacēkara Ālvār, Pmā!TM 3.5: "beautiful bridegroom" (alakiya maṇavāļa). 
"Vessels made of gold" (patadgrahaḥ) refers to the golden vessels into which water is poured after being used to bathe Śrīrangaraja. 
For the nine ladies beginning with Vimalā, see also Rāmā- nuja, NG, and Bhattar, KD, Nos. 28-29. In both texts, Vi- malā and the other attendants are described as holding a chowries or whisks (cāmara) in their hands. Both the

"My life" (asmadasūn) is based on Nammālvār's TVM 7.2.9, in which he calls out to Śrirangarāja "O my life" (ennutaiyaviye). 
The phrase "in order to bring the entire world under one umbrella" is an expression of royal imagery; Hindu kings often sit under an umbrella which functions as a symbol of the unity of the kingdom. 
This verse begins the section on Bhattar's exit from the temple. 
"For one hundred years" is a Vedic expression based on the ideal life span of 100 years. It is a standard formula for blessing. 
"by the deep eyes” (nayana-culukanaiḥ, lit., “by eyes like culukas"). Culuka denotes a small, deep, eye-shaped vessel used in the pūjā ritual. Here it refers to the depth of the eyes. 
The reference to four kinds of persons who approach the Lord is based on BhG 7:16: "O Great One among the Bharatas (Arjuna), the four kinds of virtuous men who worship me are the distressed (ārta), the one desirous of knowledge (jijñasu), the seeker of wealth (arthārthi), and the wise (jñāni)". 
The words "Kamala's eye" refer to the fact that the Lord is very essential and precious to Kamalā (Śri). 
Acting as the bed or couch of Śrirangarāja is one of the many services which Adisesa performs for the Lord. This is brought out well in Poykai Ālvar's MTA, v. 53, which says that Adisesa acts as an umbrella for the Lord when He is walking, a throne when He is seated, shoes when He is standing, and a bed on the vast ocean. He also acts as a beautiful lamp, a beautiful and smooth silk cloth, and so forth. 
Note the play on words: "We are revived" (aśvasimaḥ) can also mean "we breathe again or freely". In other words, the breathing in and out of Ādiseșa which rocks the swing- ing couch enables us to now "breathe again" or "breathe freely".

Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part I 
Nidrā, meaning "the sleeping one", is also one of the epithets of Śri, and is therefore "interchangeable" with her. See Lakṣmi Tantra 8.31-36, in Gupta 1972: 47. 
Compare with Kulacēkara Āļvār, Pmā!TM 1.1, in which Śrīrangarāja is described as having "feet massaged by the 
Kāverī". 
The main sanctum of the Srirangam Temple rests on a raised rectangular platform (Hari Rao 1967:16), which is appar- ently what Bhattar refers to in this verse. Since the image of a cloud resting on a mountain-top is a common one in San- skrit poetry, I have translated adrau as "on a mountain". Properly speaking, however, the temple is not situated on a mountain. 
YMD 5.1-5 describes the eternal realm (nityavibhūti) as composed of "pure sattva” (śuddhasattva), a type of non- material substance that is different from the matter affected by the three gunas. All of the bodies of the Lord, including His iconic incarnations, are made up of this "non-material substance" (v. 5). Note, however, that in YMD it is said to be "non-conscious" (acetana) and "self-luminous" (svayaṁ- prakāśa) (v.2). By way of contrast, Bhattar would appear to categorize the ornaments of the Lord as conscious: they are said to experience horripilation "on account of their being in the form of cit" (cit mayatvāt). I would hesitate to interpret this passage as a philosophical statement; rather, it appears to contain purely poetic imagery. 
The description of Śrīrangaraja in this verse is similar to many contained in the DP. Compare with a few examples given below: 
Tonṭaraţippoți, TMalai, v. 2, depicts Śrīrangarāja as having "a body like a huge green mountain" (paccaimā malaipōl mēni); Nammāļvār, TVM 2.6.4 addresses Him directly thus: "O my Emerald Mountain (en marakata malaiye); PĀTM 3.2.3 describes Him as having "a body like gold and emerald" (ponmanimēņi). 
For a discussion of the supremacy/lordliness of God as defined by His eternal association with (or embrace of) Śrī, see Nayar 1992: 225-32.

The two possible etymologies of the epithet Puspahāsa are: (1) puspam iva hasaḥ yasya saḥ puspahāsaḥ, a Bahuvrihi compound meaning "One who smiles like a flower"; and (2) puşpasya hasyaḥ iva saḥ puṣpahasaḥ or "He who is like the bloom of a flower". Bhattar prefers the second etymology according to BhGD, No. 952. He writes: "In the case of those who have the ability to enjoy Him, He manifests His enjoyable nature gently, just like a flower that blooms in the evening. Therefore, He is [named] Puspahāsaḥ." The latter etymology is reflected in this verse. 
Since there is no preposition used with the word "good fortune" (subhāgatam), gramatically it may mean either "[our] good fortune" or "[His] auspiciousness". Compare the imagery of this verse with Nammālvār, TVM 3.1.1: "Has the splendour of Your face bloomed as the brightness of Your crown"? 
"May [His face] roam about in me for enjoyment (viharatu mayi) is based on Tiruppāṇ Ālvār, Aāp, v. 4: "[His] waist- cord roams about in my soul/inner being.' 
Compare with PĀTM 1.9.2: "Your curls of hair (parkika!) swarm [near] Your coral-like mouth just like a bee (vantepol) drinking honey from a red-lotus flower." Ambrosia is popularly believed to flow from the moon. "the god of love" (Smara), more commonly known as Manmatha. For similar imagery, see Antal, NTM 14.6: "The beautiful curve of the eyebrows, like the bow (carrika) which is in His hand..." and Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.4, in which the Lord's eyebrows are compared to the sugarcane bow of Manmatha. 
"white [streaked] with light red" (ātāmr-dhavale). Compare with Tiruppaṇ Ālvār, Aāp, v. 8: "those big eyes with light red streaks". 
102 "moss-like plants" (saivalām). The attractiveness of this 
type of plant rests in the fact that it keeps the water clean and pure. 
105 In Sanskrit poetics, kings are portrayed as bearing the bur- den of the universe by their arms. In the case of Śriranga- rāja, his shoulders are the support of all things sentient (cit) and insentient (acit). 

224 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part I 
106 The main icon in Śrīvaiṣṇava temples usually faces East; 
however, in Śrirangam the Lord lies facing South. It is believed that He chose to lie facing South toward Lanka in order to bless Vibhiṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa's brother. 
The Alvārs wrote on the same theme. See, for example, PĀTM 4.9.2: "They will serve no other but our Arankan, of bud-like eyes, which strained toward well-walled Lanka, for the sake of wealthy Vibhīṣaṇa" (translation by Ate). 107 "Platform" (vedi) refers to the raised platform found in the 
courtyard of most Tamilian houses. 
108 In ancient Tamil poetry, women measured the worth of men 
according to the marks they had obtained in war. Here we have a description of Śrirangarāja's hands being rough with the bowstring of battle. 
113 A thread with the five weapons of Viṣņu (as ornaments) 
and the nails of a turtle and a tigress is worn in Tamil Nadu even today by small children as an amulet to ward off evil. PÄTM 1.7.2 describes the child Kṛṣṇa wearing the thread with a turtle shaped ornament. 
115 Three lines on the stomach are regarded as a beautiful fea- 
ture of the body. 
The three kinds of cit are the eternally free souls (nitya- suri), the liberated souls (mukta), and those who desire liberation (mumukşu). The three kinds of acit are that which is mixed with sattva (miśra-sattva), that which is devoid of sattva, and pure sattva (śuddha-sattva)(Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1969). 
116 Compare with Nammālvār, PTAnt, v. 72: "Some say that 
three gods are equal (mutalāni, lit. supreme), some that only one of the three is supreme....Isn't the lotus flower [from which all creation came] inside You?" (translation by Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari). 120 "Golden Land" (marma-sthala). According to Puranic cos- 
mology, there is a golden land beyond the seven oceans: "...the seven island continents are encompassed successively by the seven oceans, and each ocean and continent is respec- tively twice the extent of that which precedes it.... Beyond the sea of fresh water is a region of twice its extent, where 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe) at Srirangam 225 
the land is of gold and where no living beings reside" (VP 2.4.88-97, translation by H.H. Wilson). 
The word translated "dusk" (sandhya) refers to the time of the conjunction of day and night, and hence may mean either dawn or dusk. 
121 Compare the imagery in this and the following stanza with 
that of VRS, vs. 57-58. Bhattar has based these two ślokas on his father's composition. 
124 "His foot...is a witness to the happiness of Laksmi's hands" 
refers to the joy that Lakṣmi experienced while massaging her Lord's feet to remove the pain caused by His wandering in many places in His incarnational forms. 
Following the Alvārs, Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard Kṛṣṇa's acting the role of a messenger to the Paṇḍavas as an expression of condescension toward His devotees. See, for example, Tirumankai Alvar, PmālTM 2.2.3, in which Rama is said to have conveyed his messages through a monkey, and then afterwards, in His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, He Himself became a messenger for the Pāṇḍavas. 
128 Aṇṇankarācāriyar's commentary (1969) notes that at the 
completion of the sacrifice (yajña), the bath called avabṛta- snana is required. And now that this stotra is finished, we bathe in Srirangaraja's feet in that same manner. 
127 
Rāma and Sita are believed to have worshipped Śrīrangarāja on their return to Ayodhya from Lanka. For that reason, He is especially dear to them, and hence they are said to wor- ship him always.

The Latter 100 Stanzas 
1 
The compassionate Lord gives the Veda as a lamp to dispel the darkness 
and to distinguish good from evil. 
Wise people behold and enjoy [the Lord] 
by means of that lamp 
while some capricious [people] become moths [burnt in its flame]. 
2 
The Smṛtis of the Jainas and their ilk 
which deny the authority of the Veda 
and those which accept the authority of the Veda 
but interpret it wrongly 
darken the path of approach to You, 
O Treasure of [Śrī]rangam! 
Manu remembered that! 
3 
O Possessor of [Śrī]rangam! 
Learned people reject the path of those who deny the validity of Vedic knowledge {which is obtained] by direct perception by robbing [clear-sighted ones] 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 227 
of what is right before their eyes, and of those through their own capacity 
for fallacious reasoning 
arrive at contradictory meanings for Śruti 
which is by nature faultless 
because [their scriptures] are defective on account of their having an author. 
4 
Because [the body] has limbs it is perceived as distinct by the external sense organs, 
whereas the indivisible soul transcends the sense organs and 
shines as the subject of perception. 
Because of the close connection of body and soul 
people do not discriminate 
between them. 
Your Sastra focuses on [the soul] 
which is fit to go to the other world O Lord at [Śrirangam! 
5 
O Lover of [Śrī]rangam! 
Understanding of the meaning of Śruti 
is also [obtained by means of] direct perception; its meaning regarding dharma and adharma 
the phenomenal universe 
the transcendental realm 
and the Lord 
is not contradicted by direct perception 
and is faultless! 
O Lover of [Śrī]rangam! Just like direct perception, 

228 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
that Śruti [produces] valid knowledge, 
even for the Cārvāka school. 
[A Cārvāka] who has a mind awakened by yoga may directly perceive its meaning. 
Isn't it so? 
6 
The contemptible quack Buddha, denying the existence of all things 
without any reason 
according to the four categories 
is, is not, both is and is not, neither is nor is not 
so that the world no status at all, 
is fit to be cut to pieces 
like a thief! 
7 
If [the non-existence of all things] is accepted still this denial [of existence itself] 
cannot be established, 
for (if you maintain that all things are non-existent] 
then who is it who makes the refutation? 
O Bestower of Boons! 
If the existence of one thing is denied 
then the existence of something else will be established 
as when a pot is broken 
the pieces remain. 
Even according to this philosophy 
[the non-existence of everything 
must include] the non-existence of valid knowledge. 
[Therefore, there is nothing to deny.] Let Śruti conquer! 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 229 
8 
The Yogacara denies [the existence of] the world 
the Sautrāntika says that the world 
is an object of inference 
on account of the plurality of minds 
and the Vaibhāṣika declares 
that the perception of that [world] 
is momentary. 
All three say that 
knowledge alone is the "soul" 
and it too perishes from moment to moment. 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
Those three! 
We strike them down! 
9 
[The Buddhist statement that] "The world is momentary and the soul is nothing but 
the knowledge of momentariness" is incorrect 
[because] if there is no knower other than knowledge 
the things that ought to be known 
as well as the knower 
perish in the twinkling of an eye, and this world is deprived of memory and recognition, 
O Rangacandra! 
10 
The difference between the soul and knowledge is made obvious in a statement such as 
"I understand this". 
230 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
If [as the Advaitins claim, 
the soul and knowledge] are one, 
then the things apart from these two 
are also a part of that oneness. 
If those things are unreal, 
then according to that argument 
all things [including knowledge and the soul are equally] unreal! 
If knowledge of everything is unreal then that [knowledge about unreality] will itself be false! 
[If they claim a ridiculous view like that] then our philosophical school should have a long life! 
11 
Foolish people have taught that Brahman -- Who is knowledge alone -- 
becomes confused by ignorance 
even though self-luminous. 
When the individual soul has attained mastery over the knowledge of the non-duality 
of this [Brahman], 
illusion is removed 
and whatever is perceptible 
is then [known to be] false. 
Let Rama's weapon destroy those who are analyzing Brahman as if He were a person belonging to this degenerate and despicable Kali Yuga!

O Best among the dwellers in [Śrirangam! Having accepted the jugglery 
of the seven explanations 
[beginning with] "may be, is and is not", Jaina philosophy describes 
the whole wealth of Your world 
as indeterminate in nature. 
In the same way, 
another [philosophy] has said that this world is 
both different and non-different [from You]. 
O Moon of Śrirangam! 
Let [the followers of] these two [philosophies] 
who are knowers of a new Brahman 
[of their own creation] 
talk among themselves about this great secret in phrases like: 
"My mother is barren". 
13 
Begging from Śruti the well-established idea that You are the Cause of the world, Kaṇacara and Caraṇākṣa 
according to fallacious reasoning transformed [that idea by declaring] atoms [as the material cause of the world], and proclaim that Your creation 
beginning with ether 
is independent of You. 
14 
O Splendorous One at [Śrī]rangam! 
When the Veda is ascertained as authoritative 
on account of its having no author 

232 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part 
other [scriptures] are regarded as authoritative on account of their being rooted in that [Veda]. 
Therefore [while] Sāmkhya, 
along with Yoga and the Pasupata school [may be] authoritative in some matters, Pañcarātra is completely authoritative 
because it is derived from the "Fifth Veda". 
15 
The Samkhyas placed You 
in the category of a puruşa 
and do not accept You as Lord 
because they misinterpret 
the statements pertaining to Isvara. 
In a different way, 
a follower of Yoga philosophy 
declared that the quality of lordship is like a reflection, 
didn't he? 
In still another manner, 
the Śaivas 
out of an excessively passionate attachment [to Śiva] 
think that lordship resides in a beggar, 
O King [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam! 
Because of Your great affection [for the devotees], 
how richly abundant 
You have revealed [Yourself to be] 
with [Your forms] beginning with para, vibhava, and vyūha.

The philosophical schools 
which deny the validity of the Vedas I regard as [equal to] a blade of grass even though established by You in a deceptive manner. 
[If that is so], O Lord, 
then what will I think of 
the path of those with erroneous ideas who are clad in the armour of the Vedas? 
17 
O Resident of [Śrī]rangam! 
During the cosmic dissolutions 
You kept the authorless Veda in Your mind, then recollected it at the times of creation and provided the appropriate name and form [for each created entity]. 
Having taught [the Veda] to [special] people 
beginning with Brahma 
who was awakened from his sleep, and decreeing the welfare [of all], 
You bestow [upon us] the authorless Veda 
an authoritative means to valid knowledge. 
18 
Šikṣā teaches the proper order of syllables. 
Correct understanding of the meaning of words is taught by vyākriyā and nirvaci. 
Chandas gives clarity about metres, and jyotiṣa teaches us proper ritual timings.

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
Kalpa-[sūtra] has declared 
the appropriate ordering of rituals, 
and the clear meaning of Purāṇas and Smṛtis 
may be discovered 
by means of Nyāya and Mimāṁsā. 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
The Vedas 
aided by these [eight disciplines] 
seek You out. 
19 
Primarily, the Vedas are 
the means to valid knowledge. 
Smrtis, along with Itihāsas, Purāṇas and Nyāya, assist [in the understanding of the Vedas]. 
The first portion [of the Vedas] 
exhaustively examines methods of Your worship, while the lofty division 
revealing Your activities, qualities, and glory examines [the way] to reach Your feet. 
O Blessed One! 
You Yourself declared: 
"I am known by all the Vedas". 
20 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
Wrong-notioned philosophers say 
that the power of the sacrifice is apūrva, or that the performers [of a sacrifice] 
obtain its fruits 
by the grace of the ancestral fathers and the gods. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 235 
[But] masters of the Three [Vedas] say that ritual sacrifices and meritorious works are Your worship, 
and their fruit proceeds from Your favour because the prescription for their performance is Your own commandment. 
21 
Prescriptions for the performance 
of daily and occasional [rituals] are Your command, 
and you make allowance for the directive concerning [rituals to be performed] 
by those desirous of [boons such as] heaven. 
Śruti [describes] the use of spells 
for the destruction of enemies 
as a means by which the wicked-minded 
are brought under the control of the Sastras. 
Oh! [Śrī]rangam's All! 
This Śruti reveals the desire of You 
Who belong to everyone 
and are Controller of everything 
to protect [Your creatures] 
and so it is Your eternal commandment. 
22 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
All the [Upanisadic] statements 
such as "There is a treasure here" 
which describe Your qualities, form, and activities lead to the Final Goal. 
These statements 
[describing Your qualities] have no special distinction 

236 
Śrirangarāja Stava: Part II 
from injunctions regarding 
Your worship and its fruits. 
23 
The body resides in its possessor; 
modifications 
which have exact form, intellect and speech [are contained] in the instrument; 
individual manifestation, jāti, 
qualities and karma 
are contained in the material substance. 
Thus, on account of the fact that 
[things] are located (in other things], 
You think that this whole world is in You 
and because of this 
You are described as non-dual. 
Then why are there confusing statements 
concerning māyā, limiting adjuncts 
and modification, 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam? 
24 
The triumphant world-famous Vedic scholars explicate [the Upanisadic statements] 
which declare the non-difference 
between You and the world 
beginning with 
"All this is indeed Brahman" 
"All [things] have That as the Self" 
"All this and I [are Vasudeva]" [and] "You are That" 
[to mean that] the manifestation 
of the entire universe 
is dependent upon You and is Your body. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 237 
You are described as its Soul because You preserve, create, make manifest, swallow, control and pervade it! 
25 
Fools prattle that this world 
has a Lord 
has no Lord 
has many lords 
or again, has a Lord created by people 
according to their own desire. 
Some subsidiary sections [of scripture] advanced the logic that 
[Your creation's] variegated diversity 
is the result of its lack of submission [to Your will 
because it is bound by karma], 
but Śruti itself has sung that 
sentient beings (cit) and insentient matter (acit) 
are eternally governed by You, 
O Bestower of boons! 
26 
[The gods] beginning with Brahmā 
are declared to be in the category of the "created" and not in the category of [divine] incarnations 
because they are slaves 
to the movement of Your eyebrows. 
You are not like those [other gods] nor are they Your equal. 
So with words pertaining to You from Śruti and the sages, such as: 
"The world is under a single umbrella" and "[You are] the consort of Laksmi❞

that the world is caused by ignorance are refuted by Your quality of omniscience. 
Autonomous, independent 
and with just a tiny portion of Your desire, You manifested all [creatures]

simultaneously, without obstruction and without thinking it a great thing. 
O Lord reclining in [Śrī]rangam, This lordship differentiates You

that desire is Your creative power

is the foundation of Your own greatness because it removes the necessity, O Lord, 
for Your dependence upon any other cause.

You change all things 
by Your presence alone 
without [being] changed [Yourself] -- 
just like fragrance from a musk-deer's navel. 
O Beloved Ranga!

immutability. 
The cause which [itself undergoes] modification is thereby differentiated [from You].

dreamless sleep

At the end of the cosmic dissolution when cit is indistinguishable from acit

Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
but at the same time passing through 
a succession of states 
with Your mind full of compassion 
and dependent only upon Your own will [to create] 
O Bestower of boons 
You caused the buds of matter 
in the form of intellect, egoism 
the five elements, and the series of senses 
to unite with the [five] sense organs and bodies. 
42 
Along with their companions the Brahma Sutras, the Srutis proclaim that in You 
Who create [the universe] 
only after taking into account 
the various deeds of the world's creatures 
low, high, and pitiable 
there is no chance of partiality 
or lack of compassion, 
O Owner [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam! 
43 
O [Śri]rangam's All! 
Like the craftsman's consideration 
for the collection of instruments at his own disposal 
or an enjoyer's regard 
for his own body which is under his control 
or a reigning king's consideration 
for the deeds [of his subjects 
some of] whom are obedient 
and [some of] whom are transgressors 
or also the glance of a donor 
upon one who desires many things 

Praise-Poem to the King (of the Universe] at Śrirangam 245 
at the time of creation, 
the Creator's regard for the [karmic] status 
of the ones to be created 
should bring Him only autonomy. 
44 
O Bestower of boons! 
Of Your own free will, 
expanding the part of Your own body 
called cit and acit 
which slept during the time of cosmic dissolution, You play in the presence of Śri 
like a peacock in front of a peahen spreading and shaking 
its multi-coloured feathered tail 
as if it is inlaid in the sky. 
45 
Although You have as Your chief aim 
the welfare [of all creatures], 
leading those 
who are on a path detrimental to their own good 
are controlled by despair 
and sunk in the torrent [of samsara], 
time and time again 
You follow the rules of vama and aśrama 
and experience affliction 
[during Your incarnations here on earth] 
just like a mother drinking medicine 
when her baby is ill, 
O Rangaraja! 
O Welfare of all! 
46 
O Splendorous One at [Śrī]rangam! 

246 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
If all Your activities are not done in vain hope beginning with the creation and preservation of this fool-filled world 
[only then] is the perpetual awakened state 
of you who never tire, 
which is forever like the continuous stream 
of regular seasons, 
appropriate. 
47 
Punishing cruel people with hell and the like, You protect [Your devotees] from distress just like a good-hearted friend 
who fetters the feet of a madman, 
O Leader of [Śri]rangam! 
According to the "Maxim 
of the Stick and the Sweets", 
[what need is there to mention that] 
Your offer of enjoyment and liberation 
to good people 
[arises likewise] 
from Your quality of good-heartedness? 
48 
Time and time again 
You behold Your creatures 
incorrigible, though You gift them 
with the Sastras 
and with Your glances of protection which sustain and control [the worlds]. 
Then You 
Imperishable Soul and Birthless God playfully descend here [to earth] 
in a state equal to gods, humans, and animals. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 247 
49 
Had Indira not appeared along with You 
her form and actions appropriate 
for each and every one of Your incarnations, then Your sportive activity [here on earth] would surely have become insipid 
as well as condemned, 
O Rangaraja! 
50 
O Blessed One! 
Calm and steady persons understand well that Your birth in human and other forms is [an expression of] Your greatness, but fools, not knowing this, 
show disrespect toward Your birth and activity 
destroyers of [the cycle of] births [and deaths]. 
51 
If Your initial incarnation 
in between Brahma and Śiva 
was to conceal Your supremacy 
by making them seem to be Your equals, then why, O Splendorous One of [Srirangam, do you take these [other incarnations] 
which manifest Your supremacy here [on earth] 
inducing people to the true path 
and nurturing them with Your grace? 
52 
Please, O Possessor of [Śri]rangam! 
Incarnated as a horse, 
You destroyed the obstacles Madhu and Kaiṭabha, bestowed upon Brahma divine vision 
in the form of the Three [Vedas], 

248 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
and gave life to the whole world freely and spontaneously! 
53 
O Sustainer of [Śri]rangam! 
Enriched with the nectar of the sacrifice 
that is knowledge, 
coming forth in the form of a swan -- 
cool, pure and a devourer of darkness just like the moon -- 
You favoured those afflicted [in samsara] with the bright light of the Vedas. 
54 
O Splendorous One of [Śri]rangam! Lying on a banyan leaf 
looking like a sleeping baby ocean 
You put Your lotus-foot into Your mouth. 
[Why did you do such a thing as that?] 
Was it in order to measure the worlds 
[which You hold] in Your stomach? or was it with a longing for it to be enjoyed 
by the Vaisnavas [dwelling there]? 
55 
You uprooted Mount Mandara 
brought it [to the ocean] and tied it with the serpent. 
Arms covered by swinging garlands, 
You churned the ocean as if churning curds. 
O Lord at [Śrī]rangam! 
You first acquired the moon 
the kaustubha gem, nectar and so forth 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 249 
and when You obtained Kamalā Your entire effort became fruitful. 
Isn't that true? 
56 
When the lord of the elephants [Gajendra] 
shouted for help, 
God, the Glory of [Śri]rangam, 
became mentally agitated, 
withdrew His tender leaf-like feet 
from their massage 
by the goddesses' lotus-hands, 
abruptly left the serpent [couch] Ananta and 
opening wide His eyes 
with their trembling eyelids, 
pulled His chest away 
from Lakşmi's jar-like breasts 
shining with saffron paste. 
May [That One] appear before our eyes! 
57 
Homage to the speed of the Lord Who 
when He heard the trumpeting 
of the most excellent elephant [Gajendra] threw His harem into confusion! 
Ignoring the hands [of Visvaksena] 
spread before Him, 
[the Lord] refused his offer of jewelled sandals and, 
neglecting to decorate His vehicle, 
mounted onto the king of the birds [Garuḍa]. 
250 
58 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
When You heard the trumpeting of Gajendra 
spread abroad, 
observing Garuda with Your mind 
which forever leads all the worlds and supposing him to be too slow, 
You insulted him by kicking Him with Your feet and got him to move by shouting "giddyap". 
Lifting him up 
You rose [into the sky]. 
O God! 
O Friend of [Śri]rangam! 
When [like Gajendra] 
a person bows down [before You] 
Your condition [becomes that of a madman] who runs here and there 
not knowing where he is going! 
59 
O One reclining in [Śrī)rangam, You are my refuge. 
[Upon hearing] the trumpeting of the elephant, [You felt troubled], saying "Woe is me!" 
Wearing garlands, ornaments, and garments 
all in disarray 
You came [to Gajendra] 
dancing like a lotus pond 
blowing in a strong gale. 
O Blessed One! 
60 
Having the body of a fish, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 251 
You put the multitude 
of moving beings and non-moving things and Your own pleasurable words 
of the Veda and its branches 
into a boat along with Manu 
and bore them without even a moment's fear 
concerning the cosmic dissolution. 
61 
Having the wonderful form of a fish 
radiant, long, very wide, beautiful clear, cool, and flashing 
just like the eyes of Śrī 
and fond of playing in a puddle 
and in the water of the ocean 
swallowed and ejected through Your fins, You darted about here and there. 
62 
O One Who delights-in Śrī! 
As the Tortoise Who supports all the worlds, You explained the dharma. 
Becoming Kurma, 
and bearing Mount [Mandara] on Your back 
during the churning of the nectar, 
You obtained glory 
as the lovely emerald-seat 
easily accessible to 
the tender sprout-like feet of Lakṣmi 
who was rising up out of the water. 
63 
Being in the form of the Primordial Boar, throwing the foaming ocean 
of the cosmic dissolution 

252 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
onto the enemy of the gods [Hiranyakasipu's] chest 
which was dug by Your tusk, 
and embellishing the breasts of the Earth goddess with saffron in the form of that demon's blood, You grunted at Brahma who 
agitated by Your bushy broad-spreading bristles [began] praising [You]. 
You are my refuge, 
O Possessor of [Śrī]rangam! 
64 
O Lord in [Śri]rangam! 
We worship the Lion Who has 
a bushy mane, huge teeth, and a united form 
according to the "Maxim of Milk and Sugar". 
People who have seen a man or a lion separately shrink back on seeing the wonder of 
the natural union 
human and lion! 
65 
His shoulders made moist by the masses of blood 
[flowing] from the enemy 
torn by His claws 
[blood] which resembles splendid sweet spittle from the mouth of Lakṣmi 
who was prevailing upon Him 
to pacify the forest fire in his eyes arising out of hatred for the enemy, 
the Man-Lion obstructs sin here [in Srirangam]. 
66 
Eagerly bearing the qualities of human and lion 
in the same suitable, although contradictory, place out of an excess of anger, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 253 
You caused the disappearance of Your devotee's enemy 
by the tips of Your claws. 
Having a gigantic form 
a two-fold extension 
of the qualities of the All-pervading One You have fostered the [whole] world. 
67 
As Vamana You became a beggar 
in order to remove the wastefulness arising from 
the demon [Mahabali's] generosity 
and Indra's petition. 
The group of three worlds 
equivalent to [three] atoms became like grains of sand sticking to Your lotus-feet 
as You traversed [the worlds]; 
the lotus [arising from Brahma's] navel was there, desiring to create yet another group of worlds 
to be measured [by Your steps]. 
O Lord Ranga! 
The Veda is a drum 
which announces the victory 
of Your activity [as Vāmana]. 
68 
Having become the Bhrgu clan's Rāma 
adorned with an axe, 
You destroyed the kings, 
pleased the group of deceased ancestors 
with their blood, 
and lightened [the load of] the overburdened world. 

254 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
O Faultless One! 
Although You seem ferocious 
to Your enemies 
You overlook my sins! 
69 
Having agreed [to become] human, O Lord, 
You descended [to earth] 
along with the Lotus Lady. 
When she made a play of hiding herself 
in the garden, 
You constructed [a bridge] over the ocean, 
and removed all the limbs of the demon enemy 
who was puffed up with pride 
because of the boons given him 
by Brahma and Śiva, 
making him into leftovers 
for a family of monkeys. 
70 
O Lord at [Śrirangam! 
We will serve You, [Balarama] 
the ploughholder and farmer of [the world's] welfare 
Who counted his victory in gambling with the King of Kalinga's sprout-like teeth 
Whose momentary separation [from Kṛṣṇa] caused the uproar created by Kaliya 
and Whose activity as messenger made the cowherdesses 
forget the transgressions of Kṛṣṇa. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 255 
71 
Devaki wanted You, 
[the Supreme] Brahman 
Who resembles a slow-moving rain filled cloud the wearer of the golden garment 
the Lotus-eyed One [carrying] five weapons, 
to be her baby. 
O Beloved One of [Śrī]rangam, 
Who else longs for 
such a child? 
72 
In the intoxication 
[caused] by the melodious sound 
of Your flute 
mountains and fire became 
cool liquid 
sages became 
fools 
senseless trees along with the cowherders became 
enlightened 
huge poisonous snakes became 
nectar 
and cows and tigers became 
brothers. 
Other things were also changed 
and You Yourself 
O Lord 
became 
just another one among them. 

256 
73 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
Having the form of Kalki, 
You will give relief to the world 
and will kill the polluted rogues of Kali [Yuga]. 
O Resident of [Śrī]rangam! 
Annihilate all the cruel ones right away saying, 
"Cut, [them to pieces], 
Cut [them to pieces]"! 
74 
Let cease the counting of Your births 
overflowing with auspicious qualities [as well as] the numbering 
of the groups of Your qualities 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
You delight at being worshipped in this world 
in temples, homes and hermitages, 
bearing all things 
and in a condition 
of complete dependence upon the temple priests. 
Tender-hearted persons are stunned at this character [of Yours]. 
75 
Having thought thus: 
"The Auspicious Heaven 
is beyond the level of speech and mind; all incarnations [are limited] 
to some [particular] time; 
but this state [of incarnation in an icon] 
is for the welfare of the entire people" and blinded (to our faults] by Your compassion, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 257 
You soften the hearts [of Your devotees] with glances welcoming to the afflicted. 
You sleep in the [Śrī]rangam Abode 
in the awakened state 
made unsteady by Your consideration to protect the [whole] world. 
76 
Knowing the One sleeping on Ananta with his own mind broadened 
by his experience as creator in many eons, Brahma who bathes in the Ganges 
flowing from the water-pot used for pūjā and who praises You on his own 
with the help of his wife Bharati, worshipped You with His faces, eyes, and hands-folded-in-supplication like lotuses bent down [before You]. 
77 
O All-pervasive One! 
You Whose lotus feet 
are worshipped by the waving of lamps 
and luminous with lustre 
from the gem-studded makaras 
on the groups of crowns 
belonging to the Kings of the Manu Dynasty prostrating [before You] 
are suitably adored in the Abode of [Śri]rangam in Your form as Maithili's Husband. 
78 
Although the members of the Manu Dynasty and the auspicious Brahmā [are present], 

258 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
You [remain here] 
solely because of the esteemed Vibhīṣaṇa. 
O Lord! 
[Reclining] in the middle of the river, You gladden this people 
poor in auspicious qualities! 
79 
May I worship that Lord at Srirangam Who 
because of the great lustre 
which reaches from His crown 
clear down to His toenails [Gayatri Mantra] describes as 
the well-known and worshippable Supreme Splendour of the Sun, and the Śrutis describe as 
the Red-lotus-eyed [Lord] 
and the Golden One. 
80 
You are the Soul of [all] moving beings 
and non-moving objects, 
the Eye of the sun, Varuna, and Agni. 
For hundreds of autumns 
[here] in [Śrī]rangam 
may we see You 
Who have an eternal and inherent 
close association with Laksmi. 
81 
I will not leave the Master to Whom I belong Who sleeps in [Śrī]rangam's lofty sanctuary. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 259 
With servitude [to Him] 
as my essential nature, 
I worship Him with sacrificial oblations 
consisting of knowledge. 
82 
I take refuge with You, the Lord at [Śrī]rangam, 
the life of all Your subjects 
the ambrosia of the gods. 
An individual soul who exists for That One, I cleave to You Who are 
the glorious Supreme Brahman! 
83 
O Master of [Śrī]rangam! 
According to the verses of the Gītā, O God, 
without any discrimination 
You consider as equally generous 
those who have Your refuge as their [only] help 
[whether they be] 
one desirous of regaining lost wealth 
one wishing to acquire new wealth 
one who [wants the experience of] his own Self 
one who is desirous of knowledge 
one who wishes his own servitude [to You] [or] a wise one. 
84 
Without attachment and without egoism, 
devoid of all worldly desire 
and with minds [concentrated on] 
the Supreme Soul, 
some perform 
the daily, occasional and optional commands 
260 
O Moon of Rangam 
without really acting. 
Śrīrangaraja Stava: Part II 
85 
Considering the individual soul 
as the twenty-fifth [tattva] and having distinguished it 
from the group of shining tattvas, those who concentrate their own minds 
on the bearer of truth [within themselves] reach themselves. 
Those who unite themselves to You 
obtain You, 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
86 
With their attachments destroyed 
and with minds made tremulous from the intensity 
of their inherent slavery [to You], 
some offer You praise, meditation, and salutations, and obtain the greatest goal -- 
they exist in You! 
O Lord at [Śri]rańgam? How can this be? 
[For] You exist in them! 
87 
Upanisadic statements say that the Possessor of Sri 
declared cit and acit as His own 
[possessions] 
by [His activities] beginning with the creation, maintenance, and direction [of the worlds] 
and takes them to Himself. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Srirangam 261 
[We see] here that the state of being 
the means and the goal 
is Your true nature, 
not just [a reflection of] two of Your qualities. 
So without any pretext 
I chose You as my refuge, 
O One reclining in [Srirangam! 
88 
A creature is put in the state 
of transitory existence or Final Liberation 
by You alone 
in the same way that 
a cowry is placed in the category of 
a penny or a gold piece 
by a clever [king). 
Protect me --You and only You -- 
O Treasure-house of [Śri]rangam! 
89 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
Without the wealth of knowledge, 
works, or devotion, 
devoid of desire, eligibility, ability and repentance, 
ignorant and full of sins 
with my mind foolishly confused 
by worldly affairs, 
I say: "Be my refuge". 
90 
While You, the Supreme Goal of life, 
Who have me as Your chief object of concern, are [right] here [before us] 

262 
Śrirangarāja Stava: Part II 
O Rangacandra 
I deceive the entire people. 
Trusting in unreal things 
which cause the soul to perish 
and arrogant at being a spiritual guide, I [act] like a wise man 
who has the same form as You! 
91 
Transgressing Your commandments 
and prohibitions, 
I continuously injure You and Your devotees in word, thought, and deed. 
I delight in 
consciously or unconsciously committed offences unbearable to You. 
O One devoted to [Śrī]rangam, 
out of Your forbearance 
please don't consider me 
as belonging to another, 
[rather, look upon me as Yours alone]. 
1: 
92 
When there exists here [in Srirangam] 
a dense shade [created by] 
the boon-bestowing tree of Your shoulders, 
still I take shelter in 
the shadow of sensual enjoyments 
resembling the expanded hood 
of an angry snake, 
O Life of [Śri]rangam. 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 263 
93 
Alas! Friend of [Śrī]rangam! 
The strength of insects [like myself] is greater than all Your creative power! 
Crossing beyond even Your grace, 
this insect perishes -- dying while still living -- [just like a silkworm 
which makes its nest and then dies there] 
as described in the "Maxim 
of the Silkworm in its Cocoon". 
94 
O Lord at Srirangam! 
Who has seen the other shore of [the ocean of] my sins? Who has seen the other shore of [the sea of] Your good qualities? 
For just like a do-nothing 
who remains thirsty in a flood I am not adept in satisfying my thirst [by drinking in] Your auspicious qualities 
showering down [upon me]! 
95 
Being born in human and other forms, 
because of Your grace 
You experienced the matured fruits 
of the actions appropriate [to those births], O One reclining in Srirangam. 
If that is so, then why should we be troubled [by having to bear] again and again happiness, distress and all the rest? 

264 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
96 
Your patience will approach even a guilty one 
who has true repentance 
but how can it exist in an arrogant sinner like me? 
Even so 
O Overlord [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam Your boundless patience may forgive 
even an unrepentant [man like me]. 
97 
Known throughout the whole world always, 
let Your patience 
which contracted 
[when directed toward] great sinners like the crow [Jaṭāyu] and Sisupāla 
because they had an iota of an auspicious quality 
roam about in me 
who am ignorant of even the thought of having a tiny bit of [a single] auspicious quality, 
O Bestower of boons! 
98 
Your compassion removes misfortune for others [but] the sorrow of samsara is happiness to me, so I am beyond Your mercy. 
Even though sorrow causes me to rejoice, take pity on me 
O One abounding in auspicious qualities! 
O [Lord] Who lives in the [Srirangam Temple! 
99 
Encircled by the waves 
of the six kinds [of suffering] 
the womb, birth, old age, death, pain, and karma, 

Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam 265 
I have longed for You 
Who are worthy of Sri 
just like a dog [who wants to eat the food] offered to the gods in the Vedic sacrifice. 
100 
O Treasure-house of [Śrī]rangam! Enjoyment of the prosperity 
bestowed by You 
is better for a dog like me 
than the feigning of humility 
[founded on] the imitation of my predecessors. 
101 
O Lord at [Śrī]rangam! 
Having forsaken You 
Who have taken an vow for the welfare 
of those who -- once only -- 
-- 
have surrendered to You, imploring 
"I am Yours", 
I become egoistic due to the absence 
of trust and discrimination. 

…

266 
103 
Śrīrangarāja Stava: Part II 
Compassion consists in being unable to bear 
the sorrows of others; 
You are non-different from others, 
so You are not compassionate. 
You do not even know the offences 
of those who bow down [before You], so You do not have patience, 
O Moon of Rangam. 
O Lord, You regard Your wealth 
as [already] belonging to those who long for it, so You cannot be called generous. 
104 
Lift up this very dejected person 
with the loftiness of Your auspicious qualities, O Master [of the Universe] in [Śri]rangam! 
[For after all], the lordliness of the Lord [consists in] the complete satisfaction of His supplicants' desires! 
105 
You support those who delight in ritual actions 
knowledge 
devotion 
and detachment 
just like water bears fish. 
O Lord at [Śri]rangam! 
If You protect 
a very insignificant one like me, 
it would be [like] a shed 
in which cool water is kept 
[for travellers] in the deserts.

NOTES 
"Veda" (māṇam, synonymous with pramāṇa, lit. "a means to valid knowledge"). In the context of this stanza, the reference is to sabda, or scripture. 
Śrīvaiṣṇavas frequently quote this stanza in order to dem- onstrate the importance of scripture as a pramāņa. 
The imagery of the Veda as lamp is in found Tirumankai Ālvār, PTM, 8.9.4 in which the phrase "...a lamp spread in the form of the Vedas" (maraiyāy viritta vilakkai) occurs. "Jainas"(arhat). Arhat may refer to "a Buddha who is still a candidate for Nirvāṇa; a Jaina; a superior divinity with the Jainas; the highest rank in the Buddhist hierarchy" (M-W, 93). In this stanza the term is used to refer generally to those who deny the authority of the Veda. 
"Manu remembered (or taught) that!" (smṛtavān manustat) is a humorous reference to Manu Smrti wherein Manu ex- pressed his view of the validity of Smrtis: "Smrtis which deny the authority of the Veda (veda-bahyaḥ, lit. “which are outside the Veda") or which interpret it according to wrong ideas (kudṛṣtayah) all are considered to be in ignorance and useless" (Manusmriti 1961: 12.106). 
This stanza is the beginning of a section extending through v. 15 which consists of a refutation of the various philosophical schools and religions. By including stanzas of philosophical refutation in what is by genre a praise- poem directed to the Lord at Srirangsam, Bhaṭṭar is following Tonṭarațipoți Ālvār, TMālai, vs. 7-8. 
For purposes of clarity, the stanzas of philosophical refuta- tion (vs. 4-15) have been loosely translated. 
The people mentioned in this stanza as not discriminating between body and soul are the Cārvākas, who do not accept the existence of the soul because it cannot be perceived: "...the Cārvāka admits the validity of only one pramāṇa, viz. perception, and rejects not only verbal testimony but also in- ference....The Cārvāka...does not believe in any spiritual values and is content with the worldly ones of sensual plea- sure (kāma) and wealth (artha)....He repudiates the authority

Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
of the Veda which, according to the orthodox, is the source of belief in such values, saying that different parts of it are irreconcilably at variance with one another, and that it is therefore impossible to make out what it really teaches" (Hiriyanna 1974: 57-59). 
"contemptible quack Buddha" (sugatapāśaḥ). The suffix pāśa carries a wide variety of negative meanings. Sugata is one of Buddha's many epithets. 
"Is...neither is nor is not" is the "Madhyamika definition of the ultimate reality...viz. that it neither 'is' nor 'is not', nor 'both is and is not', nor 'neither is nor is not'. It ex- cludes all conceivable predicates, including that of non-exis- tence; and the ultimate has accordingly to be viewed as be- yond all conception, and not as absolute nothing" (Hiri- yanna 1974:82-3). 
Bhattar refers to the Lord at Srirangam as Varada or "Be- stower of boons" in his refutations of Buddhist philosophy (vs. 6-7), thus contrasting the world-denial of the Buddhists with the more positive attitude to the world that exists in Vaiṣṇavism. 
Some modern scholars would disagree with Bhattar's in- terpretation of Buddhist (and especially Madhyamika) thought found in this and several other stanzas. "...the ma- jority of modern scholars who have studied this school of thought [i.e. Madyamika] are of the opinion that 'the void' (sūnya) here means only that it is nothing, as it were, since it is altogether incomprehensible" (Hiriyanna 1974:82-3). 
In their violent tone, this and several other of Bhaṭṭar's stanzas resemble Toṇṭaratipoți Alvār's TMālai (see especially v. 8). 
Bhattar refutes three schools of Buddhism in this stanza. Compare with Rāmānuja, who divides Buddhism into four schools: "[the Vaibhaśikas] admit the external things which consist of the elements and the products of those elements, and which have all of them the nature of an aggregate constituted by infintesimal atoms belonging to the elements, earth, water, fire and air, as also the internal things con- sisting of the unceasing flow of consciousness, love and hatred; [they hold] that these are all established by

perception and inference.... The Sautrāntikas are of opinion that all the external things consisting of the earth etc. are capable of being inferred by means of the understanding.... Others [i.e. the Yogacaras] hold that the understanding without [any] external objects is alone the real entity, while all the external objects resemble the objects perceived in dreams. All these three schools also hold that the reality accepted by them is momentary in nature.... There are others still [i.e. the Madhyamikas] who uphold the nothingness of all things" (ŚrīBh II.2.3.17). 
"Rama's weapon" (rāmāstram) refers to the arrow or missile of Rama, which was so powerful and precise that it never returned until fulfilling its aim. 
"The jugglery of the seven explanations” (sapta-bhangi- kusṛtim). Jaina philosophy attempts to reveal the "relative character of our knowledge of reality that is made known through the sapta-bhangi; and it consists of seven steps since there are seven, and only seven, ways of combining the three predicates, taking them singly, in twos and all to- gether. To state the first four steps of the scheme: (1) may- be, a thing is; (2) maybe, it is not; (3) maybe, it is and is not; (4) maybe, it is inexpressible...(5) maybe, a thing is and is inexpressible; (6) maybe, a thing is not and is inexpressible; (7) maybe, a thing is, is not and is inexpressible" (Hiriyanna 1974: 67-8). 
Kaṇacara (or Kaṇāda) is the name of an important Vaišeṣika philosopher; Caraṇākṣa is a philosopher of the Nyaya School. 
"It is in elaborating this [Nyāya-Vaiseṣika] cosmological scheme that the system postulates the existence of God as the all-knowing Being, who disposes the atoms in the man- ner required for the emergence of the world as we know it. He does not create the atoms, because they are eternal like him. In other words, he is only an efficient cause possess- ing the will and intelligence required for bringing about the desired result [and not the material cause of the universe]" (Hiriyanna 1974: 89-90). 
"Fifth Veda", that is, the Mahābhārata. 
270

Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
In recognizing the partial validity of the Samkhya, Yoga, and Pasupata schools, Bhattar follows Ramanuja: "It is dif- ficult to concede authority in respect of reality as it is, to systems of individual origin, on acount of their arguments about principles conflicting with one another and on account of their stand against the reality which is to be known only from the Vedas, which are free from the slightest trace of all imperfections like carelessness, etc. on account of their su- perhuman origin (apauruṣeyatvena); Nārāyaṇa, who is the Supreme Brahman, is to be known from the Veda; hence the reality of every principle taught in the various systems, such as the pradhana, the puruşa and Pasupati, is based on their having for their self Nārāyaṇa, who is the Supreme Brah- man to be known from the Vedas...It is not that everything in these systems is to be repudiated, as is the case with the philosophies expounded by Jina and Buddha" (ŚrīBh II.2.8.42). 
"soul" (purusa). The Samkhyas teach that there are two eternal entities: matter (prakṛti) and souls (purusa). "...God is here one of the Purușas so that, though eternal and omnipresent, he is not all comprehensive. There are other Purusas as well as Prakṛti to limit his being...he is not responsible, in the ordinary sense of the term, for the cre- ation of the world which...is the spontaneous work of Prakṛti. All that he is stated to do is to prompt, in a way, evolution of Prakṛti or to bring about its connection with Puruşa needed for the evolution" (Hiriyanna 1974:125). 
the 
Bhattar calls the quality of lordship as understood by [Patanjali's] Yoga philosophy a "reflection" (prati- phalanam). Although the school accepts the existence of God, it believes His existence can be known only by in- ference: "The argument [for the existence of God] is that the gradation of knowledge, power, and such other excellences which we notice in men necessarily suggests a Being who possesses those excellences in a superlative form" (Hiri- yanna 1974:125). 
"Beggar" (bhiksu) refers to Siva. When Śiva cut off the head of Brahmā, his skull stuck to Siva's hand, and re-

16

mained there until filled with alms. Therefore, Bhattar calls Śiva a "beggar", an image of Siva popular with the Alvārs. "Even though established by You in a deceptive manner" (mohana-vartmana). An alternative reading is mohana-varș- manā or "[established] by Your infatuating greatness or handsome form". The first reading is based on the com- monly held belief that even the heterodox philosophies are the creation of Lord Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. It is for this reason that nearly every Śrīvaiṣṇava temple contains a statue of Kapila, one of the forms taken by Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, Who is said to have created various erroneous philosophies in order to reveal, by comparison, the greatness of Visiṣṭādvaita. Following SvetUp, v. 18, Bhattar says that Nārāyaṇa teaches the Veda to Brahma, and then to the rest of the world through him. 
20 
Bhattar mentions eight aids to the study of the Vedas. The last two, Nyaya (logic) and Mīmāmsā (a particular school of Vedic interpretation) are not normally listed with the stan- dard six. The remaining six are called the vedarigas ("limbs or branches of the Vedas"). 
"The first portion [of the Vedas]" (pūrva-bhāgaḥ) refers to what is usually called karma-kanda or pūrva-mimāmsā. It includes the ritualistic portions of the Vedas which, accord- ing to Ramanuja, "give small and transitory results" (ŚriBh 1.1.1.1). The "lofty division" (ürdhvaḥ bhagaḥ), usually termed brahma-kanda or brahma-mīmāmsā, refers to the Upanisads, which give knowledge of Brahman and final release (ŚriBh I.1.1.1). 
This stanza is frequently quoted by Śrīvaiṣṇavas. Note that Bhattar follows Ramanuja in regarding the entire Veda as a single unit (ŚrīBh I.1.1.1). 
"I am known/made known by all Vedas" (vedyaḥ vedaiḥ sarvairaham) is based on Kṛṣṇa's statement in BhG 15.15: "I alone am known by all the Vedas" (vedaiśca sarvaiḥ aham eva vedyāḥ). 
"ritual sacrifices" (ista); "meritorious works" (pūrta). 
"Apūrva" refers to "the remote or unforeseen results of ritual actions (such as heaven). Two schools of Mimāmsa- kas are indirectly referred to in this stanza: the Prabhakara 

272 
24 
26 
29 
30 
Śrirangaraja Stava: Part II 
School of Mimāṁsā teaches that the sacrifices create power (apūrva), and a lot of powers taken together give heaven, etc. The Bhatta School of New Mimāṁsā teaches that these sacrifices are worship offered to ancestors and the gods, and their fruits come from their grace. 
"All This, indeed, is Brahman" (sarvaṁkhalu[idaṁ 
brahma]) is from ChUp 3.14.1; "All [things] have That as the Self" (aitadātmyam [idaṁ sarvam]) is from ChUp 6.16.3; "All this and I [are Vasudeva]" (sarvam idam aham [ca vasudevaḥ]); "You are That" (tattvaması) is from ChUp 
6.8.7 and 6.16.3. 
The phrase "has a Lord" (sarājakam) is a reference to the view of Nyaya philosophers, who accept the existence of God on the basis of inference. The phrase "has no Lord" (arājakam) refers to the Mimāmsakas, who deny the exis- tence of God. The phrase "has many lords" (aneka-rajam) refers to those people who believe in the equality of the three gods Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva (Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1974). 
The offering of "satisfying water" (jalamucitam) to the dead refers to the ritual offering called tarpaṇa, which involves "the refreshing (especially of gods and deceased persons) [rşi-pitr] by presenting to them libations of water" (M-W, 440). 
This stanza describes the Lord as priceless because of His qualities. A more usual Śrīvaiṣṇava interpretation is that the qualities of the Lord get their value from their association with Him. See, for example, SVS, vs. 47-8, and SBS, v. 
22. 
The image of the Lord possessing an infinite number of senses, symbolic of His omniscience, is taken from PuSũ: "The Person who has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand legs...." 
According to the commentary of Aṇṇarkarācāriyar (1974), if the term "caused by ignorance" (ajñamūlam) is taken as referring to insentient objects (acit), the stanza is a refutation of Samkhya philosophy; if interpreted as referring to (māyā), it is a refutation of Advaita.

The navel of a spider, from which the web emerges, is an image commonly employed analogically to the creative power of Brahman. MUp 1.1.7: "Just as the spider casts out and draws in [its web], as on earth the annual herbs are produced, as from a living person the hairs of the head and body spring forth, in that same manner, the universe is generated from the indestructible [Brahman]". 
Śaivas do not accept the Lord as the material cause of the 
universe. 
The idea expressed here is that while the fragrance of musk has an effect on the persons who smell it, the quality of the fragrance itself is not changed in being smelled. 
In this stanza, Bhattar combines two of Ramanuja's defini- tions related to the doctrine of causality. See Carman 1981:163. 
The Aranyakas are difficult texts to comprehend. The par- ticular reference in this stanza is most probably to the Bṛhad Up 2.1, a passage that can be easily used by Advaitins to substantiate their understanding of Brahman as qualityless. For svarupa and svabhāva in the theology of Rāmānuja, see Carman 1981: 88-97. Sudarśana Sūri, who commented upon Rāmānuja's GT, identifies svarupa (essential form) with īṣitṛtva (lordliness/ supremacy/sovereignty) and svab- hāva (essential nature) with saulabhya (accessibility) (Carman 1981:91). In the commentary on this stanza by Aṇṇankarācāriyar, vaipuli (greatness) is glossed with svarupa. 
The four stages of meditation are mentioned in this stanza -- "the awaking state" (jāgrat); “dreaming sleep" (svapna); "dreamless sleep" (atyalasa); "the fourth and final state" (turiya). Bhattar elaborates upon the four stages in his BhGD: "In the first group [of meditators], the external senses function; in the second group they do not function, only the mind is active; in the third group even the mind does not function, there is only breathing; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended. In the Paramapada there is a pillar called viskha-sthambha, composed of non-material matter (śuddha-sattva). There are four parts in the pillar from the base upwards and on the four sides of each part are

the four vyuha-forms -- Vasudeva, Samkarśana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The four parts, with one of the four vyūhas in each, correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them" (Bhaṭṭar, BhGD, No.140, fn). 
"According to Samkhya philosophy, the first thing to emerge from Prakṛti is 'intellect' (mahat), which in turn gives rise to the principle of individuality or "egoism" (ahamkāra).... From egoism, two groups of principles proceed: One of them consists of the further aids to conscious life, that is, manas, the five sense organs, and the five motor organs, that is, speech, handling, walking, evacuation (payu) and reproduction. The other principles forms the basis of the objective world, that is, the 
group five elements" (Hiriyanna 1974:110).

The image here is of a mother who drinks medicine herself instead of giving it directly to her sick baby. The baby re- ceives the benefit of the medicine through the drinking of its 
mother's milk. 
"The Maxim of the Stick and the Sweets" (danda-apupika- [nyāya]) teaches that, when a stick (used to drive away the rats) and sweets have been kept together, if the stick has been eaten by rats, then we need not speak about the sweets for we can be sure that they were eaten too. Bhattar refers to this maxim in another context in BhGD, No. 45. 
Compare Bhattar's view of the inseparability of Viṣṇu and 
Śri with VP 1.9.140-43. 
"Fools...show disrespect" (avajānanti mūḍhāḥ) is based on BhG 9.11: "Fools show disrespect for me who have re- sorted to a human body" (avajānanti mām mūḍhāh manuṣim 
tanumāśritam). 
"The...sacrifice that is knowledge" (jñāna-yajña) is based on BhG 9:15: "With the sacrifice that is knowledge (jñāna-ya- 
jñena)...worship me". 
The swan who brought the Vedas to the world has been praised by Tirumankai Alvar in PTM 5.7.3, in which it is said that the Lord became a swan (annnam), graciously re- vealed the Veda (marai), and destroyed the darkness.

"To measure the worlds [which reside] in Your stomach" is a reference to Vişņu's swallowing of the world. While the verbs in this stanza are in the imperative, they have been translated with a sense of the past tense according. to Panini 3.4.13. When a number of verbs are used in a single stanza, imperative terminations may be used with the sense of the past tense (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, February 1987). 
Tirumankai Ālvar identifies the Gajendra episode with the Lord at Srirangam in PTM 5.8.3. 
The idea of Viṣṇu's hurried response to the trumpeting of the elephant Gajendra being viewed with wonder by the res- idents of Vaikuntha is expressed also in Tontarațippoți Alvar, TMālai, v. 44. 
"According to the Maxim of Milk and Sugar" (sitäkṣira- nyāyena) refers to the maxim based on the example of the mixing of milk and sugar. When milk and sugar are mixed together, you cannot differentiate between them. 
"dependent upon the temple priests" (arcaka-parādhīna). Arcakas are temple priests who are specialists in ritual per- formances. The first half of this stanza refers to the previ- ous stotra verses in which Bhaṭṭar has enumerated and praised the qualities of Vişnu's transcendent form (vs. 27- 38) and His occasional incarnations (vs. 39, 49-73). In the second part of the stanza, Bhattar introduces the topic of Vişnu's iconic incarnations. Doctrinally, this is an impor- tant and often quoted stanza because it emphasizes the im- portance of God's presence incarnate in the worshippable temple icon (arcāvatāra). 
Sleeping in the unsteady awakened state refers to the Lord at Srirangam's yoga-nidra. It is interesting to note that the vyūhas are always in the state of yoga-nidra since they are associated with creation, the idea being that when thinking deeply, or planning seriously, the eyes are often half-closed. The Pañcarātra Agama texts refer to the time of the temple icon's four-month slumber (yoga-nidra) as a time when the daily temple rituals (nitya) continue, but special (naimittika and kamya) rituals are prohibited.

"The waving of lights" (niranjana) refers to the Pañcarātra Agamic ritual which involves the waving of lighted lamps 
before an icon as an act of adoration. 
Both the Tamil and Sanskrit commentaries gloss the implied subject of the verb as Gayatri Mantra. 
"The Golden One" (suvarna) is based on ChUp 1.6.6. "Red-lotus-eyed [Lord]" is an epithet of historical impor- tance in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. According to a popular hagiographical story, Rāmānuja broke with his teacher Ya- dava Prakasa over the interpretation of this epithet. Compare with BhG 9:15. 
The twenty-four tattvas include prakṛti, mahat, ahaṁkāra, the five elements, the five qualities inseparable from the five elements, the five sense organs, the five organs of knowl- edge, and manas. 
Compare with BhG 9:14 and 9:29. 
Theologically, this is an important stanza, for here Bhaṭṭar proclaims Lord Visņu as both the means (upaya) and the goal (upeya). 
In medieval India, kings had the discretionary power to in- crease or decrease the value of coins such as the cowry- shell. 
This stanza substantiates Bhattar's position within Śrī- vaiṣṇavism as an Acarya, called here a desika or [spiritual] guide. 
"Maxim of the Silkworm in its Cocoon" (kośakāra-nyāya) describes the silkworm which makes a cocoon from out of its own mouth and then dies there, unable to come out. TVM 7.5.2 refers to the Lord's facing of all kinds of un- bearable things during his incarnations here on earth. "offered to the gods in the Vedic sacrifice" (deva-vaşat kṛtam, lit., "uttered [the word] 'vaşat' to the gods"). Vaşat is an indeclinable exclamation spoken by the Hotri priest at the conclusion of the Vedic sacrifice. 
102 This stanza may well refer to the ritual of pañca-saṁskāra.

abounding in thick rasa 
due to your state of non-separation from each other.

O Goddess! 
26 
As if with your own breasts, arms, and eyes, You console your Beloved with Nila, Bhumi 
and His thousand other consorts 
who are inherently enjoyable to you [and the Lord] in the same way that flowers and sandal paste exist [solely] as objects of enjoyment, 
and who are led by you as conduits carrying off 
[the overflow] from [your and Viṣṇu's] fully satisfying love.

Oh Śri! O Mother! 
Compelled by hearts mixed with deep emotion 
and melting with love, eternally present for the activity 
of massaging your feet 
and those of Srirangam's Lord, 
the eternally free souls 
who enjoy servitude [to you] 
are like friends 
devoid of distinguishing characteristics 
in qualities, form, dress, activities, nature, or enjoyments 
eternally free from even a whiff of imperfection. 
28 
O moon-faced one! 
At the time of the [Vedas'] ascertainment 
of the nature] of the Lord, 
His inherent autonomy 
is [proclaimed] solely by virtue of 
the excellence of His intimate connection with you. 
You have the exalted dignity 
of being the very basis of the definition 
of your Husband's [essential nature]. 
Because you are included [in the definition of the supremacy of the Lord] 
O Mother Śrī 
Śruti does not refer to you separately. 
O Kamalā! 
29 
The word "auspicious" is extended to the Lord only because of His contact with you. 

Jewel-Treasury of Śrī's Auspicious Qualities 
There is no other reason. 
Someone who wishes to tell of 
the richness of the [delightful] fragrance 
that makes a flower flourish 
does not describe that [fragrance] as sweet because it has the status of being 
[a quality of the flower].

The one on whom a multitude of your sidelong glances [fell] became the Supreme Brahman. 
[The ones] below Him 
on whom only two or three [of your glances fell] became [the gods] beginning with Indra. 
So, O Śri, in affirming these [gods], the Vedas [really] praised you, [because] the [laudatory] description of a city and its treasury 
is in effect the glorification of its king! 
O Śri! 
31 
By your very nature you belong to Vişņu; but [even though] the Lord's state of prosperity 
is dependent upon you, 
He did not become one whose 
glory is dependent upon another. 
A precious diamond with its own splendour neither becomes defective 
nor is its independence in any way dulled [because its] lustrous quality is impressed on it by another.

O Indirā!

Other [qualities] also common to you both 
beginning with youthfulness

as if [we are looking] in a mirror 
[which reflects] your [qualities] in Him 
and His in you, 
O victory flag

34 
[Auspicious attributes] beginning with youthfulness 
are common to you and the Lord;

the qualities common to masculinity 
such as autonomy, control of the enemy, 
and steadfastness 
and having gifted you 
with qualities exclusive to femininity 
beginning with softness

you two surely enjoy [each other], O [Lady] who plays in the centre of the lotus! 
36 
O Supreme Sovereign at Srirangam! I think that the things of great value 
beginning with the moon 
the desire-granting creeper ambrosia 
and honey-liquor 
obtained their status as the residue 
of the Milk Ocean 
because they were joined together with your form which has the auspicious qualities of 
softness, coolness, loveliness 
generosity and sweetness. 
[But no!] Your divine form 
does not deserve 
this ineffective, artificial and confused description!

When [the devotees] come before [Viṣņu and Śri] to favour them with the practice of prostration, she who [sits] at His side

In the same lofty category 
as a quivering golden campaka garland 
[decorating Lord Ranga's black body] [and a streak of] gold 
on the [black] touchstone [of her Beloved], [Sri's] form 
is not a proper object of speech! 
38 
May we see you perpetually 
seated in the centre of the lotus-couch 
with one lotus-foot folded under you and the other hanging down 
[in readiness] to receive my salutation, with your sweet, charming face [overflowing] with billows 
of wide and compassion-filled sidelong glances 
and your lotus-hand 
positioned in a gesture inviting fearlessness, O Mother! 
39 
May I bow down before Indira's two feet 
lofty in their status as lotus petals 
which make fragrant the Vedanta. 
From the friction [of Indira's footsteps], 
[the garland] Vaijayanti 
[resting] on the chest of her Beloved gets a freshness as if 
drenched with cool dewdrops.

O Lakṣmi! 
[If the eyes of kings

how in the world can 
the greatness of your sideling glances be clearly extolled? 
O Lotus [Lady],

protect me, a shelterless one, 
with your inherently blissful sidelong glances 
by which the Lord [Himself] 
drenched up to the neck in love

Lotus pollen wounds your feet and the powerful sight

Then, O Mother, 
[for one such as you]

[while] your action of swinging on the garland 
[resting] on the shoulders of Hari 
makes us shout the words, "Alas! Danger!" 
O Śri! 
How can this very tender body of yours patiently endure being crushed 
by [my harsh] words?

Even now your breasts 
are devoid of the defect

Preparing a garland from flowers in the form of your soft body 
filled with a wonderful fragrance blooming with tender youthfulness and made cool and moist

O Goddess! 
O Supreme Sovereign at Śrīrangam! Shame on me [for speaking like this], I who am a poet in sudden confusion! 
45 
You delight the Granter of Liberation eternally 
O Goddess

NOTES 
"I join my palms together in supplication" (kṛto añjaliḥ, lit. "añjali is offered"). 
The precise meaning of this stanza is unclear, even to P.B. Aṇṇankarācāriyar(1954). 
In this stanza, Bhattar says that Laksmi "enriches" the Lord. For a discussion of the historical origins of the im- portant Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine that Viṣṇu gets his lordly status and auspiciousness on account of his relationship with Śrī (śrī-patitva), see Nayar 1992:228-32. See also vs. 28 and 31. 
"Vişņu" (murabhid). Murabhid is an epithet of Lord, Vişņu, meaning "the slayer of [the demon] Mura". In this verse, Bhaṭṭar asks the Goddess to grant him power- ful speech. For a discussion of the role of inspiration as a legitimizer of the stotras, see Nayar 1992:48-53. Phaṇāmaḥ has been translated here as "We say". This is ac- cording to Krdantarūpamālā 1968:122, which states that verbs having the meaning "to go" can also mean "to under- stand or to say". 
For Śiva as a beggar, see ŚRRS II, n. 15. 
In this stanza, Bhattar refers to the people of five philo- sophical schools: (1) Buddhists and Jainas; (2) Mīmāmsa- kas; (3) Nyāya Vaiseṣikas; (4) Advaitins and (5) Šaivas. PuSu praises Śrī as the Lord's consort thus: "Hri and Laksmi are your two wives/consorts" (hrisca te lakṣmisca patnyau). 
The phrase "uplifting its hands" refers to the habit of raising the hands while swearing the truth of something. 
In accordance with the basic teaching of Śrīvaiṣṇavas on Śri, vibhu has been translated here as "lord [Brahma]". While in Śrīvaiṣṇava writings vibhu usually denotes Lord

28 
Vişņu, "the All-pervading One", the term also can mean "lord" and may be applied to Brahma, Viṣṇu and Śiva. 
303 
An alternative translation is "from the headman of a small village clear up to the All-Pervading One, the controller of the entire universe". 
"Showing his rows of teeth" is a standard Indian descrip- tion of a person in a destitute and pitiable condition. "Dance" (tandavam) is usually associated with Śiva, who creates and destroys the universe by this frantic dance. Note, however, that Lakṣmi need only glance, and her cre- ative power is effective. 
The analogy here is that of a king who wants to entertain his Queen. A fancy dressed male in female clothes is mistaken by those who see him as a real female prostitute, and they approach him. When it is discovered that he is a male, the queen laughs at the scene. Creation is like that -- for the entertainment of Śrī. 
"Darkness" (tamas) is glossed as "matter" (prakṛti) in Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1954. 
For Ayodhya and Aparajitā, see ŚRRS I, n. 29. 
"The gem-studded audience hall” (āsthānaratnam), the place where the people assemble when royal business is being conducted, is referred to in PÃTM by the Sanskritized Tamil phrase atanimaṇṭapam. 
The description of "thick rasa" (rasa gahana) is used in an Upanisadic passage which says that Brahman cannot be separated from rasa (like salt dissolved in water). Here the image is used to describe the inseparability of Śri and Nārāyaṇa. 
Bhattar's description of the hood of the serpent Adiśeşa used as an umbrella is based on Tirumankai Alvar's PTM 7.8.1. 
"eternally free souls" (sādhyāḥ devāḥ). Bhaṭṭar's stanza is based on PuSu 3.5.11: yatra pūrve sädhyāḥ santi. The term sādhyāḥ devāḥ appears in his BhGD Nos. 70 and 849, where according to context it must be taken to mean "eter- nally free souls". 
See Poykai Alvar, MTA, v. 42.

Śri Guna Ratnakośa 
The theological point made in this verse is that Śrī is supreme among the many consorts of Visņu, and that the other consorts are merely her limbs, and gain their status only through her. 
This stanza and v. 31 are important theologically. They celebrate the central Śrīvaiṣṇava teaching that the lordliness or supremacy of Visnu is based on His association with Śrī (the doctrine of śrī-patitva). 
"Supreme Brahman" (param brahma). While the view expressed in this stanza is in conformity with the teachings of the early Pancarātra Agamas, it contradicts the usual Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding of Śri (including Bhattar's!), because it suggests that the Supreme Brahman is inferior to and dependent upon the Goddess. I can make sense of the stanza only by interpreting it as extreme hyperbole, with no theological significance at all. See also v. 15 and n. 15, where my translation of vibhu as "lord [Brahmā]" is questionable. If Vibhu is taken to mean "the All-pervading One", then surely it refers to Visnu, and the theological statement of v. 15, like that of v. 30, would appear to contradict the Śrivaiṣṇava view of the Goddess' role in the creation of the worlds. 
The beauty or qualities of a person are often praised in San- skrit poetry in the manner of this verse; for example, “the essence of the lotus has become your face". Bhaṭṭar says that while we can use these typical poetic conventions to compare Śrī to the moon, nectar, a lotus, etc., this kind of description is really inappropriate for her. The description of Sri's shrinking back would appear to ex- press both her desire to draw close to Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa in order to attract his attention to the devotees, and her innate modesty before the devotees who are bowing before them. This verse is a dhyāna-śloka (verse to be committed to 
memory) for icon-makers because it gives an idea of how to prepare an icon of Lakşini as she appears in Vaikuntha. This is the only model suitable for icons of Śrī to be used for worship independently of Lord Viṣṇu. 
The notion that Sri is so soft and tender that it is impossible to describe her (even with soft-sounding words) has liturgi- 

305

48

cal implications. Harsh-sounding words are never used in Śrivaiṣṇava temples (in worship-liturgies directed to Śri or Vişņu) for this very reason. Antal's TP contains the words irram irukālē. In order to soften the harshness of the sound, when these words are recited in the temple or before an icon, their pronounciation, although grammatically incorrect, is changed to ittum irukālē. 
The idea of the inseparability of Viṣņu and Śrī is mentioned in connection with their occasional incarnations in VP 
9.1.42. 
The son-in-law of an important man of the village is re- garded as the son-in-law of the entire village. The commen- taries on Bhaṭṭar's stanza unanimously agree that the Lord at Srirangam is the son-in-law of all the people of Srirangam. (A similar motif is contained in PĀTM.) 
This verse makes the important theological point that Śrī is a necessary mediator between the Lord and the devotees, and they can approach Him only because of their prior rela- tionship with her. 
This often-quoted verse expresses -- through its imagery -- the important Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine of Śri's role as interces- sor between the Lord and the devotees (puruṣakāra). For a detailed discussion of Śri's role as Mediatrix in Śrīvaiṣṇa- vism, see "The Goddess Śrī as Mediatrix" in Nayar 
1992:221-56. 
This stanza contains a play upon the most popular etymol- ogy of the name Srirangam: "Śri's stage". 
"The perishless place" (akṣara-gatīm) refers to the state of kaivalya, that is, the enjoyment of the self. Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard it as an inferior form of liberation. Some understand it as an impermanent stage on the way to Vaikuntha, while others teach that it is a final and eternal liberation attained by the practitioners of yogic meditation, but falling eternally short of Vaikuntha. 
Vidhitaḥ, the ablative of vidhi, has been translated here as "on acccount of your grace", according to TVM 5.1.1, where the word vidhi (Tamil, viti) can be taken to mean "grace". 

Aṣṭā Śloki

The meaning of the sound "a" is Viṣṇu Who effects the creation, protection, 
and dissolution of the worlds. 
The meaning of the sound "m" is the individual soul which is an instrument belonging to Visņu. 
The sound "u" governs the unique relationship of these two. 
The three-syllabled praṇava [AUM] 
the essence of the Three Vedas 
revealed this meaning well. 
2 
In the great mantra [AUM namo nārāyaṇāya], by the middle word namaḥ 
the essential nature of the person is taught; 
by regarding namaḥ [with AUM, which stands] 
before it 
the way [to God] is taught; 
by regarding it with [the word] 
which follows it [nārāyaṇa], the goal is taught. 

Eight Verses 
Having explained that autonomy, self-protection, 
and proper activity 
are not suitable for other [gods] 
and belong to Hari alone, 
then [by implication] it has said that 
they are not suitable for oneself. 
3 
I belong solely to the One 
indicated by the syllable "a" [Nārāyaṇa], not to my[self]. 
The word nārāyaṇa means the abode 
of the groups of eternal persons (nara); 
the dative case-ending indicates that 
the activities of my natural state of servitude 
[to the Lord] 
should exist at all times 
in all places 
and under all conditions.

If a person who has surrendered to the Lord 
thinks that the soul is the body, 
then let him learn well 
the third [syllable, “m"]. 
If he is blinded by autonomy, 
then let him become acquainted with the first [syllable, "a"]. 
If he has a mind subservient to others, 
then let him understand 
the second [syllable, “u”].

Aşta Śloki 
If he expects to protect himself, 
then he should learn 
[the word] "namaḥ". 
If he is unsteady in his intentions toward kinsmen, 
then he should understand 
the name "Nārāyaṇa”. 
If he has a mind moving hither and thither 
toward objects of the senses, 
then let him understand 
the dative case-ending [on the name “Nārāyaṇa"].

This six word, two part [dvaya-mantra] 
the essence of the Veda 
protects the one who meditates upon it often. 
It has explained these ten [subjects]: 
the leadership [of Śrī in the role of salvation] the eternal union [of Śri and the Lord] 
the 
group of appropriate auspicious qualities the celebration of [the Lord's] body 
the means [to God] 
the part to be done [by the the individual soul] 
the goal that is the great couple 
the lordship [of Nārāyaṇa] 
the prayer [for protection] 
and the abandonment of powerful obstacles.

Having taken refuge with Śri

Without any sense of ego,

[The Lord says:]

"Having completely relinquished the entire dharma 
which I previously enjoined 
as the means of obtaining Me, be resolved, you afflicted one, [and know] that for reaching Me I alone am the refuge. 
Endowed with all [auspicious qualities] 
beginning with knowledge, 
I free you 
who are intent in your resolve from the obstacles 
[preventing] the attainment of Me. 
Do not grieve".

O Hari! 
Convinced of my state of dependence upon You and unable to perform or even to renounce 
the means [to mokṣa] 
beginning with karma-[yoga], 
I am unfit to take refuge [with You].

Overburdened with sorrows,

who has obtained this knowledge [of the secret of surrender to You].

For the three mantras explicated in this stotra, see "Introduction" above, pp. 14-15. 
Aṣṭā Śloki 
Aṣṭā Śloki is the forerunner of the rahsya-grantha, a genre of religious literature important in Śrīvaiṣṇavism. Because its final verse is directed to the Lord, however, it regularly appears in Śrīvaiṣṇava stotra collections. For more on the rahasya-grantha, see Mumme 1987. 
The translation of this stanza is according to the prose order accepted by Tenkalai commentators. 
"The final statement (caramaṁ vākyam) of the charioteer" refers to the carama-śloka itself, spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa, who acted as Arjuna's charioteer. See BhG 18:66.

I worship the Lord at [Śrī]rangam Who [reclines] in the sanctuary which shines like a lotus bud inside the seven rampart walls in the middle of the Kāverī [River], beautiful in the sleeping position 
on the couch that is the soft Serpent-King, with one hand directed to His head 
and the other placed on His hip, and with feet familiar to the hands of the Lotus [Lady] and Bhūmi. 
2 
When may I honour again and again the Overlord at Srirangam's lotus-like face [decorated by] an urdhvapuṇḍra mark 
made of musk, 
eyes touching His ears, 
a lovely petal-like lower lip charming and smiling, luminous with a pearl crown, 
and with a brightness 
which robs the minds of those who see it?

Crying "O Slayer of Madhu! O Nārāyaṇa! O Hari! O Enemy of Mura! O Govinda!", when will I spend my days

uninterruptedly serving 
the luminous dark blue sapphire-like [Lord] Who reclines on the Serpent King 
in the city of [Śri]rangam 
adjacent to the bank of the Kāveri?

When will my impurities be destroyed by the crystal-pure waters of the Kāverī? 
When 
may I dwell in the dense forest on its fatigue-removing bank? 
Or when may I serve 
the lotus-eyed [Lord] at [Śrī]rangam 
the Possessor of auspicious qualities Who is slumbering on Seşa 
on the great and holy sand bank? 
5 
Once again may I see 
the auspicious city of the Rangam-Dweller 
adjacent to the Kāverī's 
resplendent delightful waters 
reaching up to the branches of the betel-nut trees 
which has Vedic chanting murmured by the gentle and openly delightful birds 
and which is the Final Goal gleaned by groups of wayfarers on the many and various paths.

May I never be in the divine gardens 
of the heaven-dwellers 
intoxicated and insensible 
from the imbibing of [celestial] ambrosia. 
O Lord at [Śrī]rangam, 
[rather] let me be one of the stray dogs which have taken shelter 
in Your city.

You perform a propitiatory rite to avert calamity on the false accusation that a low creature [has entered the temple], 
though it has not even come near [You]. 
O Master [of the Universe] at [Śrī]rangam! Then what expiation [will] You perform when a debased creature like me draws close [to You]!

## NOTES 
Śriranganatha Stotra 
1 For the significance of the placement of the hands of the 
Lord at Srirangam, see SRRS I, v. 106. 
6 Compare with Tonṭaratipoți Alvar, TMālai: "the company of the excellent gold-bejewelled Urvași, I shall not desire her. 
I shall seek to be anything on the sacred hills", quoted in Varadachari 1970:70. 
8 Sixteen important Vaiṣṇava sacred sites are mentioned in 
this verse. 
Karisaila is another name for the Lord Varadaraja Swami Temple, located in Kañcipuram. See VRS, n. 1. 
Añjanagiri, or Tirupati-Vengadam, located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, is the second most often mentioned sacred place in the Alvar hymns. Only Śrirangam is mentioned more frequently. See Gopalan 1972:79-8. 
Tarksyadri is another name for Tirunārāyaṇapuram or Melkote, located in what is now Karnataka State. According to the hagiographical tradition, Rāmānuja lived in this pilgrimage place for a number of years. For a summary of the traditional account of his sojourn there and the historical evidence for or against the details of the story, see Gopal 1983. See also Gopalan 1972:103-4. 
Simhacala is the name of two different pilgrimage places. One is located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, and contains a hill shrine presided over by Śrivaraha Lakṣminarasimha (Gopalan 1972:129-30). For the pilgrimage place referred to by Kūresa as Simhacala, located just outside the Tamilian city of Madurai, see SBS and "Lion Mountain" in the Glossary. 
Śrīkūrma, located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, is one of the few pilgrimage places dedicated to Vişņu's incarna- tion as a tortoise. For more detailed information, see Gopalan 1972:31. 
Purusottama (named after the presiding deity of the place) is also known as Jagannathapuri. Located in present-day Orissa, it contains the temple of Jagannatha which, 

Praise-Poem to the Lord at Srirangam 
according to scholars, was built sometime during the 12th century. See Gopalan 1972:132-34. 
315 
Badrinārāyaṇa is located high in the Himalaya Mountains in what is now Uttar Pradesh. It is said that Viṣṇu- Nārāyaṇa first initiated a person in the eight-syllabled mantra at this spot. See Gopalan 1972:86-87. 
Naimisa, or Naimīśāraṇya, is a place usually visited by pilgrims on their return from Badrinārāyaṇa. There is no ancient temple there; rather, God is said to dwell there in the form of the forest. See Gopalan 1972:84-5. 
Śrīmaddvārka, located in what is now Rajasthan State, is built near the ancient city associated with Kṛṣṇa which, as is stated in the Purāņas, was submerged in the sea. See Gopalan 1972:89. 
Prayag, known as Allahabad in more recent times, is lo- cated in present-day Uttar Pradesh. It is the site of the con- fluence of the three rivers of Ganga, Yamuna, and the un- derground Sarasvati. See Gopalan 1972:134-35. 
Mathura, on the banks of the Yamuna River in what is now Uttar Pradesh, is associated with Lord Kṛṣṇa. The ancient shrines were destroyed at the time of the Muslim in- vasions. See Gopalan 1972:89-91. 
Ayodhya, situated in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is the birthplace of Lord Rama. See Gopalan 1972:83-84. 
Gaya is located on the Phalguni river in present-day Bihar, and it contains a number of important shrines including one to the feet of Viṣṇu and one to the Lord of Vaikuntha. See Gopalan 1972:135. 
Puskara is located in present-day Rajasthan, about eight miles from Ajmer. Along with Añjanagiri and Salagrāma- giri, it is regarded as a svayamvyaktha -sthala, that is, a place holy from the beginning of time. The ancient shrine is in honour of Sri Venugopala, and the sanctity of the place is said to be described in Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata. See Gopalan 1972:137-39. 
Sālagrāmagiri, located in present-day Nepal, is sixty miles west of Kathmandu on the banks of the Gandaki River. See Gopalan 1972:85-86.

Favoured by the Lord's grace, he immedi- ately attained liberation. This story likely originated in the milieu of Southern Vaiṣṇavism because, while Gajendra figures prominently in the Alvārs' poems, his story does not appear in VP.

Knowing that the king's son and Śiva were responsible for the demoness, Kṛṣṇa, who was playing with dice for sport, had his discus Sudarsana attack her with its circle of flames. Sudarsana consumed the whole of the city, and thus Varanasi was
