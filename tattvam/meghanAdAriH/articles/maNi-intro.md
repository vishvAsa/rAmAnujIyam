meghanAdAri sUri (note the name is "meghanAda + ari" = destroyer of Indrajit [Meghanada], not "meghanAda" by itself!) was a  philosopher-acharya who lived a little before Pillai Lokacharya and Vedanta Desika. His views on SaraNAgati differed significantly from the other two acharyas, and are detailed in the work "mokshopAya sangraha" (summary of the means to liberation).  

According to meghanAdAri sUri, SaraNAgati, being a principle and act ordained in the Vedas, is strictly limited to males belonging to the three varNa-s which bear the sacred thread. In addition, in the Ramayana carama sloka, wherein Sri Rama  assures all who take refuge in him of protection, meghanAdAri sUri understands the word "sakRd" to mean "surrender to Me  *at* once", and further clarifies that this surrender needs to be repeated throughout life, like bhakti-yoga.  

The other acharyas of our tradition believed that "sakRd"  meant that only a single surrender was required, and that taking refuge was possible for all entities, whether male or female, human or non-human, bearer of the sacred thread or otherwise.

All this shows that there was a great deal of variation in what the early acharyas of our tradition believed concerning the details of SaraNAgati.  What Swamis Lokacharya and Desika believed and taught are virtually identical compared to thinkers such as meghanAdAri sUri.
