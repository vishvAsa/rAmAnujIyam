### INTRODUCTION. 
The Government of Madras took up for consideration the question of publication of the various manuscripts in different languages on subjects like Philosophy, Medicine, Science, etc., early in May, 1948. Important Manuscripts' Libraries in the Madras Presidency were requested to send a list of unpublished manuscripts with them for favour of being considered by the Government for publication. The Honorary Secretary of the Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvathi Mahal Library, Tanjore, alone complied with this request. This list as well as a similar list of unpublished manuscripts in the Government Oriental Manuscripts' Library, Madras, were carefully examined and a tentative selection of manuscripts suitable for publication was made. The Government in their Memorandum No. 34913/48-10, Education, dated 4th April, 1949, constituted an Expert Committee with the Curator of the Government Oriental Manuscripts' Library, Madras, as the Secretary, for the final selection of manuscripts suitable for printing and for estimating the cost of publication.

The Government in their G. O. Ms. No. 1820, Fducation, dated 4th August, 1952, sanctioned a grant of Rs. 9,000 to the Dr. V. Swaminatha Aiyar's Tamil Library, Adyar, towards the publication of the following manuscripts as part of the "Madras Government Oriental Series":- 
1. Tiruvācaka Vyakhyānam. 
2. Mahābhārata Cūḍāmaņi. 
It is hoped that the publication of most of the important manuscripts will be completed within the next few years. 

Some of the manuscripts taken up for publication are represented by single copies in the library and consequently the mistakes that are found in them could not be corrected by comparing them with other copies. The editors have, however, tried their best to suggest correct readings. The wrong readings are given in round brackets. When different readings are found, they have been given in the foot-notes except in the case of a few books in which the correct readings. have been given in the foot-note or incorporated in the text itself. 
The Government of Madras have to be thanked for financing the entire scheme of publication although there is a drive for economy in all the departments. My thanks are due to the members of the Expert Committee who spared no pains in selecting the manuscripts for publication. I have also to thank the various editors, who are experts in their own field, for readily consenting to edit the manuscripts and see them through the Press. The various Presses that have co-operated in printing the manuscripts in the best manner possible also deserve my thanks for the patience exhibited by them in carrying out the corrections made in the proofs. 
This edition of Nayadyumani is based on a paper manuscript preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library Madras with D. 4907. 
The size of the manuscript is 13 X 8 inches. It contains 528 pages of 21 lines to a page. This is in Grantha character. The condition of this manuscript is good. A restored copy of the same also is available here under R. No. 5300. 
It has been collated with another manuscript obtained on loan from Adyar Library (A). 
The Honorary Director of the Adyar Library, Adyar has to be thanked for lending the manuscript of his library for collation.
