      <description>&lt;p&gt;279&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XXVII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mulamantradhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having expounded the supreme truths that are to be imbibed by the genuine seekers of truth in the first twentyfour chapters of this treatise, Desika consolidated that teaching about the siddhopaya and sadhyopaya, and regulated the glory of Prapatti, in the second part of the work known as &amp;lsquo;Sthirikarana Bhaga&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third part of this work is known as Pada-Vakya Yojana - or explaining the significance of the terms and the several constructions of the terms as related to the three Rahasyas viz., the Mulamantra, Dvaya Mantra and the Charama Shloka. These three mantras illumine all the truths that have been expounded earlier in the twentysix chapters. These three chapters form in one way, the prime part or the main subject of this Great Work. The Mulamantra enlightens the essential nature of the jivatman, as being totally subservient to the Lord, and in that way develops a strong aspiration for attaining the Lord without delay. Thus, he will be having the &amp;lsquo;adhikara&amp;rsquo; or qualification for performing the means of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;309&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XXVIII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dvayadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Dvaya Mantra illumincs clearly the particular means of spiritual perfection that is prescribed in the middle term of the Mula Mantra, and also the particular object of attainment that is laid out in the third term of the Mula Mantra. This Holy Mantra is described by Desika as a &amp;lsquo;Tantrika Mantra&amp;rsquo; which is expounded in the shruti. &amp;lsquo;सकृदुच्चारः संसारतारणं भवति&amp;rsquo; - This signifies the greatness of this Mantra. The two sentences have been mentioned separately and it is ordained that it should be meditated upon with the Mantra- &amp;lsquo;इदंपूर्णं अदं पूर्णम्&amp;rsquo; - in the middle. In Sri Pancharathra Mahopanishat - in Tantra-Jnana-Pada - in the First Chapter, the meaning of &amp;lsquo;Dvaya Mantra&amp;rsquo; is described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;335&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XXIX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charamasloka Adhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The eminent Charama-Sloka is taught directly to Arjuna by Lord Sri Krishna himself. This verse ordains the performance of self-surrender, the glory of which is expounded by the Mulamantra and the Dvayamantra. Desika traces the circumstances that led to the instruction of this great mantra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the Mahabharata War, Arjuna developed dejection, despondency and was overcome with feelings of compassion towards those, who were not worthy of it. He feared that he would commit grave sin by killing those who stood in battle array against him. He mistook &amp;lsquo;dharma&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;adharma&amp;rsquo;. Not knowing the right path of action, he surrendered unto the Supreme Paramatman, his charioteer, Sri Krishna, and begged of him to show him the right path by following which he could attain ultimate good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
