      <description>&lt;p&gt;०० गुरुपरम्परा-सारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guruparampara Sara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the very commencement of this great work, we find a chapter devoted to the fact of deep devotion towards the preceptor. This section has the subject matter of T44TT 45174 or obeisance unto the line of teachers and in the conclusion it is mentioned &amp;lsquo;गुरुपरम्परासारः संपूर्णः ।&amp;rsquo; This chapter is not included in the 32 chapters that are components of Sri Rahasyatraya Sara. Therefore, a doubt is raised about the inclusion of this chapter in this great work of Rahasyatraya Sara. In this connection, the following points are raised : 1. This cannot be considered as an integral part of the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upodghathadhikara (or Introduction to the subject of the work)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Upodghathadhikara or the introductory chapter to this classic, containing thirty-two chapters, Vedantha Desika has pointed out the prime subject matter of this work and the purpose it would serve. An introduction is necessary for all kinds of works for evincing the interest of the disciples regarding the study of that subject. This introduction is like a motivation for the readers to know what exactly is proposed to be expounded in the main work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;०२ सार-निष्कर्षाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saranishkarsbadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - II&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saranishkarshadhikara (Determining the essentials to be imbibed)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After giving a general introduction to the work proposed to be written, the celebrated author describes in this section, what an aspirant should determine as the most essential thing to be followed. One has to choose the most essential object to be followed without wasting time and choose that which is most beneficial to him, after due deliberation. Knowledge is vast; time at our disposal is very little. Obstructions for gaining knowledge are many. A wise man should not waste his precious time in indulging in various learnings. He has to determine what is of supreme essence and follow it devotedly. So, in this section, Desika decides what is of utmost value to mankind and exhorts one to proceed on the path of sadhana placing that as his goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the following sections, these truths are elaborately described. Eight chapters are meant for enlightening the essential nature of the spiritual aspirant. The succeeding two chapters describe &amp;lsquo;Sanga Prapadana&amp;rsquo;. The remaining ten sections are describing the beneficial aspects of Prapathi. The essential nature of the Adhikarin for Prapathi, actual performance of Prapathi and post-prapathi duties are thus described with all the essentials in this work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The scripture mentions the essentials to be known in different ways such as, Isvara and Isithavya, Bhoktha-Bhogya-Preritha, one Supreme Brahman characterised by all other entities, etc. It is necessary for an aspirant to know first of all, his own nature, the object he cherishes to attain and the way of attaining it. He also should know what benefit he derives from the attainment of that object. When he makes an endeavour for attaining, he must be well aware of the impediments on his way also. Without a proper knowledge of these, one cannot proceed on the right line for the attainment of one&amp;rsquo;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;०५ तत्त्व-त्रयाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tatvatrayadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - V&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tatvatrayadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our Masters of yore have classified the categories in various ways, for making the disciples understand the truth clearly without any confusion. The different kinds of categorisation are not contradicting one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;categories&#34;&gt;Categories&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oneness of Paramatman characterised by the orders of the chetana and the achetana i.e. ????? is admitted by all. The difference and distinction between Brahman and the other two orders, is also admitted by all. To make the student understand the unique characteristics of the &amp;lsquo;Prakara&amp;rsquo; or the attributes, tatva is classified into six sub-divisions such as the Arthapanchaka&amp;rsquo; and the unique relationship of the &amp;lsquo;Body-Soul&amp;rsquo;. Likewise, tatva can be classified into two categories such as &amp;lsquo;Isvara&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Ishitavya&amp;rsquo;, or it may be classified into three categories as declared by the scriptures viz., Bhoktha, Bhogyam and Preritha&amp;rsquo;. It may be classified into twenty-six divisions, twenty-four divisions of matter such as Prakriti, Mahath, etc., twenty-fifth category being the Jivatman, and the twenty-six being Paramatman. In every kind of categorisation, an aspirant will realise the true nature of the matter, Jivatman and the Supreme Paramatman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;०६ परदेवता-पारमार्थ्याधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - VI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After having taught the nature of the three entities viz. Matter, Jivatman and Paramatman, in a general way, Desika has established in this chapter i.e. Paradevata Paramarthyadhikara, the nature of the particular deity which is the supreme reality. According to the teaching of the scriptures, the Supreme Brahman described in the Upanishads is verily the same highest divinity of religion. The distinction made by Advaitins between Supreme Brahman and Iswara is not tenable because there are no valid &amp;lsquo;pramanas&amp;rsquo; for positing such a difference. The argument of the advaitins that on account of the T &amp;rsquo; or auspicious limiting adjuncts, the undifferentiated brahman is appearing as Ishwara, is not acceptable, as it is only &amp;lsquo;kalpitha&amp;rsquo; or a fabric of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mumukshuthvadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - VI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mumukshuthvadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is rightly declared that three things are very rare to be obtained. Of these three, to be bom as a human being is very rare. When one is endowed with the body, indriyas, mind and knowledge, a person will do well to obtain knowledge of the Reality and make an attempt to save himself from samsara. To be born in this world again and again, is never the goal of life. A wiseman should realise that the world nearest at hand is beset with dangers and defects and that it is not his goal to live here enmeshed in matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;०८ अधिकारि-विभागाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adhikari Vibhagadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - VIII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adhikari Vibhagadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After describing the essential requirements for becoming a genuine sceker of moksha or liberation, Desika has described in this section, that there are two kinds of aspirants after moksha. Adhikarin means one who is competent and fit for undertaking spiritual discipline for gaining moksha. These aspirants are of two kinds. Both these kinds of aspirants are engaged in Nivritti Dharma and they are (1) those who adopt self surrender directly for attainment of moksha and (2) those that surrender unto the Lord for gaining liberation through Bhakti Yoga or Upasana. One is adopting prapatti or self-surrender as a direct means and the other one will be performing surrender as an accessory to upasana or Bhakti Yoga. Both these are &amp;lsquo;prapannas&amp;rsquo; as well as &amp;lsquo;Bhaktas.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The two means are &amp;lsquo;Bhakti&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Prapatti&amp;rsquo;. &amp;ldquo;I can be attained through supreme devotion to me or surrender unto me; I cannot be attained by any other means&amp;rdquo; says the Lord. In this section, the main features of these two moksha-upayas are outlined. It is also pointed out here that Karmayoga and Jnanayoga are not independent means of attainment of godhead. They are accessories to Bhaktiyoga. That Bhakriyoga can be possible of commencement and completion only through self surrender unto the Lord. Even for becoming an upasaka or a prapanna, the grace of the Lord is absolutely necessary. In the ultimate analysis, the Supreme Lord Himself is the means to His attainment. All these points are spelt in the introductory verse of this section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This section along with the succeeding two sections, forms one unit. In the twelfth section, the mode of performance of prapatti, along with the accessories, is outlined. The earlier chapters from I to ll are expounding the prerequisites that are to be known for self-surrender to be actuated. In this section, it is established that an aspirant who is incapable of practising Bhaktiyoga and who has no other means of salvation open to him, is qualified for prapatui. Even one, who is qualified for Bhaktiyoga, but incapable of bearing delay in attainment, is qualified for prapatti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was also pointed out that prapatti was a self-sufficient and adequate means for attainment of moksha. It was declared that prapatti does not require the very many accessories that are inevitable for Bhaktiyoga. Though this spiritual means does not require the accessories of Karmayoga or Jnanayoga, Astangayoga and others, it is necessarily having five accessories for becoming effective and these accessories have been prescribed in the shruties and the nature of these essentials of Prapatti are described in this section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;१२ साङ्ग-प्रपदनाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sangaprapadanadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sangaprapadanadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having discussed about the various requirements that are essential for surrendering oneself unto the Lord, in this section, the mode of self-surrender, which is of the form of entrusting the burden of the protection of one&amp;rsquo;s self to the Lord is described. This happens to be the prime factor in the process of surrender. Having qualified himself with an aspiration for liberation, having known in general terms the nature of the inseparable relationship with the Lord, and having known the several accessories that are essential for Prapatti, one becomes capable of performing Prapatti at the feet of the Lord. Whatever is described in the earlier sections will be immensely helpful to an aspirant to follow the main path of self-surrender.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He engages himself totally in the loving service of that Supreme Lord, who is an ocean of Supreme bliss, and becomes fulfilled. Though he was, prior to his surrender, an indigent person, now after entrusting the burden of his protection, he considers himself as one, who is most affluent on account of the attainment of loving service to the Lord. He is considered to be one who has donc his duty that ought to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;१४ स्वनिष्ठाभिज्ञानाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swanistabhijnanadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XIV&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swanistabhijnanadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A prapanna is one who is steadfast in the awareness of his own essential nature, which is different from non-sentient matter on one hand and the Supreme Paramatman on the other hand, who is the &amp;lsquo;sarva-seshin&amp;rsquo;, the siddhopaya and the supreme object of attainment. The understanding of these three namely the tattva, the hita and the purushartha should be firm and unshakable by any kind of perverse arguments in a prapanna. This awareness should be in him during all the time that he remains in this world after prapatri. This kind of steadfastness can be known from various factors that are significant signs showing that awareness. On account of the glory of this knowledge, the prapanna becomes capable of passing through the vast miseries that come across during the course of his life here. He will be capable of avoiding all kinds of unbecoming actions, such as seeking the grace of some one other than the Lord, worshipping those that are different from the Supreme Paramatman, studying the scriptures of other schools and thinking in vain of other things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;161&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XV Uttarakrityadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this section, the duties that are to be performed by a prapanna, after prapatti, are pointed out for the guidance of those who have adopted the spiritual discipline of paraptti. A prapanna is bound to continue his life as destined by his past karma, and he has to follow a way of life that is in accordance with his nature. Just like a Jivanmuktha who is engaged in certain duties of life, so long as he is embodied, a prapanna also follows a course of action, which is befitting with his knowledge and aspiration. Though he has nothing to do for the sake of gaining moksha, he should not live an erratic life, so long as he is here. He must realise that he should lead a life divested of all sins, performing all the time the duties of his station in life, that have come upon him on account of his association with the body. His behaviour should be so ordained as that is &amp;lsquo;swayam-prayojana&amp;rsquo; self sufficient or has the purpose of carrying out the commands of Paramatman, to please Him alone. He should not yearn for any other gain nor should he be attached to anything other than what is in accordance with his essential nature of subservience to the Lord. He will keep himself free from transgressing the commands of the Lord, and follow a virtuous life setting an example to others&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;171&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XVI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Purushartakastadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this section, it is expounded that service unto the preceptors and the godly ones, the Bhagavantas, that is ordained in the shastras, is the culmination of &amp;lsquo;bhagavat kainkarya&amp;rsquo; or loving service unto the Supreme Lord. It is pointed out that his subservience to the Lord, results in his subservience to the devotees of the Lord also, on account of the very will of that Supreme Lord, who is the Master of all, and who is the one independent Reality who can ordain all others to follow his commandments. He is capable of commanding his dependents to be subservient to His own devotees, who are supremely dear to him. As it is pointed out in the statement &amp;lsquo;T G 46 TAYTAY Grafy falsa:&amp;rsquo; which means &amp;ldquo;my devotees and their devotees are to be worshipped with all regard.&amp;rdquo; Such kind of service to the godly ones, pleases the Lord immensely and it is His supreme intention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;१७ शास्त्रीय-नियमनाधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;177&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XVII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shastriya Niyamanadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was said in the previous section that a Prapanna would abide by the Shastras that ordain certain duties. But, a number of doubts arise in this behalf. The Prapanna is not required to do the (duties of the) nitya and naimitthika karmas as an accessory to Bhakti-Yoga or Praptti, as he has performed what ought to be done and is similar to a Mukta. He does not need the direction of the Shastras, as he is required to do &amp;lsquo;svayam-prayojana-kainkarya&amp;rsquo;, loving service to the Lord and the devotees of the Lord, as svayam prayojana. Statements like &amp;rsquo;enceint: gai hach&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;risa Picshig&amp;rsquo; declare that a Prapanna has no duties to perform. The Sruti and the Smrithi are certainly binding on those who are not Prapannas. &amp;lsquo;31644: geta a&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Farby a 18441647:&amp;rsquo; and other such authorities support this view. The great Bhashyakara also has not mentioned the performance of the pancha-maha-yajnas and others as post-prapatti duties amongst the others such as the study and propagation of Sri Bhashya and others. All these doubts are dispelled in this scction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;१८ अपराध-परिहाराधिकारः&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XVIII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aparadhapariharadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this section, it is expounded that a Prapanna who commits some faults willingly, impelled by his past karmas or on account of certain spacial and temporal conditions or on account of his inadvertence, has to repent for his faults and pray forgiveness of the Lord, failing which, he would be subjected to some punishments by the Lord. A Prapanna is, therefore, warned to be very careful regarding his behaviour in this world, where he is destined to live till he is liberated from the body. It is also pointed out that one who has surrendered the burden of his protection to the Lord, is sure to obtain his desired object viz., attainment of Godhead, culminating in loving eternal service to the Lord, after being thus purified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Schana Visheshadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;193&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XCX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sthana Visheshadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was expounded in the previous section viz., Aparadhapariharadhikara, that a Prapanna should engage himself in divine service to the Lord, untainted by any offence, so long as he is destined to live in this world. He would gain the eternal service of the Lord in the Supreme Abode of the Lord after casting his body. It is described in this section, whether a suitable place is available for such a person to live in and to spend his lifetime in activities that are free from offences. Where should such a Prapanna spend the rest of his life, as most of the places mentioned by the ancient sages, have all been contaminated by worldly people and are not fit for a Prapanna to lead a calm and undisturbed life?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Niryandhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of the jivas passing out of the body has been described in the Upanishads and the same has been expounded in the Brahmasutras (second quarter of the fourth chapter). In Chandogya Upanishad, it is said that when the &amp;lsquo;purusha&amp;rsquo; dies, his speech unites with mind, the mind gets into prana and the prana into tejas and the tejas becomes one with Supreme Deity (Chandogya 6-8-6). The Chandogya Upanishad describes the passage of the released atman to reach Paramatman. There, it is pointed out that the knowers of Brahman, reach fire or &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo;, the first in the path of &amp;lsquo;Archiradi&amp;rsquo;. From fire to the deity of the day, from him to the deity of shukla-paksha, from him to the deity of uttarayana and then to samvathsara. From the deity of samvathsara, to the sun, from him to the moon and from him to the vidyuth or the deity of lightning. From vidyuth, the Amanava Purusha will unite him with Brahman. It is said that those who go by this path, never any more return to this world of Humans (Chandogya 4-15-5 and 4-15-6). This process of &amp;lsquo;uthkranthi&amp;rsquo; and the path by which a meditator upon Brahman, attains Brahman, is described vividly in the Brahmasutras in the second pada and third pada of the fourth chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The various guides lead jivatman from one place to another place and a superhuman called &amp;lsquo;Amanava&amp;rsquo;, leads him to Supreme Brahman in the end. As a king fondles his son, the prince, who is obedient to him, the Lord himself makes this liberated soul led to his place by the various &amp;lsquo;ativahikas&amp;rsquo; such as Agni and others. The &amp;lsquo;athivahikas&amp;rsquo; are as follows: -&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dcsika describes the great benefit of obtaining the bliss of communion with Paramatman for all time to come, and the unique gain of similarity or &amp;lsquo;Paramasamya&amp;rsquo; with the Supreme Paramatman. In explaining this complete experience of the &amp;lsquo;Sarveswara&amp;rsquo;, the celebrated author is guided by the upanishadic statements, as well as the conclusions of the Brahmasutras, beginning with &amp;lsquo;Karyadhikarana&amp;rsquo; (in the third pada of the fourth chapter) and concluding with the declaration of the Sutrakara with the sutra &amp;lsquo;Anavritih Shabdar&amp;rsquo; (from Sutra 4-3-6 to 4-4-22).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
