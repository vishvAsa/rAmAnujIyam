      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acharya Kritya Adhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;375&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XXX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acharya Kritya Adhikara After expounding the meanings of the three eminent rahasyas in the section &amp;lsquo;Pada-Vakya-Yojana&amp;rsquo;, Desika describes the process of handing over this eminent knowledge from teacher to pupil in the traditional way. First of all, the role of an Acharya, in preserving and transmitting this supreme wisdom to worthy disciples, is described. The characteristics of the Acharya, are also referred to, here. In the duties of the Acharya, the main factor happens to be the propagation and preservation of the &amp;lsquo;satsampradaya&amp;rsquo; or well-established tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;383&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER - XXXI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shishyakrityadhikara&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this section, the duties and behaviour of a disciple are outlined. This is an important instruction that is to be practised by all disciples for achieving fruitful success in their enquiry after knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is ordained that the disciple should be devoted to the teacher as he is devoted to God. He must be ever grateful to the preceptor for endowing him with the lamp of knowledge. Devotion towards the preceptor is the root cause of all good that happens to one. It is ordained that it should be firm. He must always recount the holy names and qualities of his preceptor with great regard. He must have great regard towards the possessions of the preceptor such as his residence or the deities or the holy texts and others. The disciple would serve that master in an eminent way if he hands over the knowledge gained from his preceptor to those of his disciples who are virtuous. He is enjoined to guard that wisdom from the unworthy. The disciple should be ever grateful to his master who has out of compassion endowed him with precious knowledge. The disciple will practise the dictates of the shastras as ordained by his preceptor. What wealth does he not gain, if he is endowed with this kind of behaviour? The wealth suggested here, is the attainment of the Supreme Paramatman, to whom he would be offering loving service for all time to come. This is pointed out in the introductory verse to this chapter: अशिथिलगुरुभक्तिः तत्प्रशंसादिशीलः । प्रचुरबहुमतिः तद्वस्तु वास्त्वदिकेषु । गुणवति विनियोक्तुं गोपयन्संप्रदायं कृतविदनघवृत्तिः किं न विन्देनिधानम् ॥&lt;/p&gt;</description>
