It is, of course, wonderful that stones and the like should become women and the like (Ahalya); (but) more wonderful is it that fire should become as cold as snow (as in the case of Hanuman) and that a blade of grass should become a missile (Kakasura); even more wonderful is the act of slaying when it becomes the means of redemption (as for Sisupala and others). So also it is most wonderful that the sandal (of Śrī Rāma) should protect the three worlds.

(Since the glory of Bhagavān is so wonderful, there is nothing surprising in prapatti to Him accomplishing wonderful things.)

We have already spoken about the limits within which prapatti has potency. We will hereafter remove the misconceptions of those who would minimise its potency,

It has been said: "The man who has done good or evil deeds of a very serious nature will experience their fruits even here (in this life) within three days, three fortnights, three months or three years". In the same way, it has been said, "Bhakti as an upāya** destroys all sins other than those which have begun to yield their fruits (prarabdha,, whereas prapatti (sadhyabhakti ) is superior to bhakti  and destroys even those sins which have begun to operate (prarabdha)". Therefore prapatti gets rid of even sins that have begun to bear their fruit (prarabdha) and yields the fruit of its own performance. As has been stated in regard to other vidyās (forms of meditation: upāsana), that the sins committed before and those committed after upāsana) will both be destroyed, prapatti, which is superior to them as a vidyā destroys (even) the suffering due to karma  which has begun to operate so that it may not continue the next instant, the next day or the next life in accordance with the degree or intensity of the man's impatience. This is the real purport of the words, "Do not despair or grieve", mā suchah (in the carama śloka).

THE PURPOSE OF IŚVARA IN MAKING

THE PRAPANNA SUFFER:

(In this connection) the following question may be asked by some who minimise the power of prapatti :-- "If this is the real meaning, should not the sufferings which are seen in the actual life of a prapanna as the result of prārabdha karma  and the performance of actions which would result in further suffering-should not these sufferings cease (at once)? If it is said that the Lord will grant the cessation of these (sufferings) only if He is prayed to, for it, by the sufferer, the question arises, "Why does not Iśvara, who is the well-wisher of all (living beings), grant, of His own accord, the cessation of these connected sufferings also, in the same way as prapatti grants incidentally such things as the ability to purify those who are in one's society. We do not see Iśvara doing this. Therefore what is said (in the carama śloka) about all gricf disappearing should be taken as not literally true, but as (exaggerated) praise of the potency of prapatti".

The answer to this question is as follows:- "Iśvara is always inclined to bestow His grace. He is eager to confer mokṣa on those who seek His protection even at (the time of) the beginning of uttering the sentence which states prapatti. But owing to the man's desire, the Lord agrees to keep him here (in this world), for some time longer. If he enjoys the inferior pleasures of life without any pain (or sorrow or suffering), his desire will never disappear. Nor will the assurance that the realisation of the Lord is truly enjoyable grow in him. Therefore as has been said in the following ślokas:

"He to whom I want to show favour - his wealth I take away from him. Then his relatives forsake him. So he is ever full of sorrow or pain. If the man who suffers in this way continues to cling to me, I show him that grace which even the gods cannot obtain"; (as has been said in these ślokas), Iśvara avails Himself of those karmas which have begun to yield their fruit (prārabdha) and which are the cause of these sufferings and punishes these men of hard hearts in order to correct them as a father and the like would (do in the case of such as their sons) with a whip at hand. It is therefore proper to consider such punishments as special favours.

When the king asked whether a disease could be (helpful), Bhattar replied that even a disease could be a teacher for us. Sufferings are teachers to the prapanna, because, if his term of life is already unalterably fixed, they would create repentance in the mind and if his term of life could be extended, they would teach him not to desire extension of life. This is well-known in such instances as Kurathalvan[^77]

The sufferings are intended only to reveal, to some, their offences with their consequences and then conceal them in order to create utter disgust, disgust like that of Perialvar who says:--- "My mind cannot bear the thought of living in saṁsāra, which is like living in a house in the roof of which there is a serpent," so that thereby they, too, might long for the release from saṁsāra which Iśvara has made up His mind to confer on them. In such contexts, the aspect of the experience of sorrow or pain is the fruit of evil deeds (in the past). The correction that ensures and that generates (the desire for) performing prāyaścitta is the fruit of the upāya, viz. prapatti.

[^77]: Azhvan on losing his eye-sight did not long for his eyes again, as they would make him look at the objects of sense-pleasures.

Among these, some punishments are the fruit of certain good deeds in the past which have begun to operate (prārabdha). When the crow (Kakasura in the Rāmāyaṇa) fell (at Śrī Rāma's feet) praying for life, the Lord gave him his life; the fruit of his prapatti was full and complete. Even the punishment inflicted on this wicked crow whereby he lost the sight of one eye was not really of the nature of a punishment. It was a special form of favour (because it would prevent him from doing evil again),

Therefore just as we learn that the Lord's punishment, which is brought about by sins committed in an instant (but) which make the sinner wallow in Hell till the great dissolution (Bramā Pralaya), has great potency, so also we should learn that the special form of praṇāma to Śrī Kṛṣṇa which is called [^78] sukrita pranāma has great potency, for it has been said: "A single praṇāma to Śrī Kṛṣṇa enables a man who wanders about in the wild and trackless forest of saṁsāra to reach the boundary called mokṣa" and also : “ Would it be right to say that a single sukrita pranāma  to Śrī Kṛṣṇa is equal to ten horse sacrifices ? (No). The man who has performed ten horse sacrifices returns again to (saṁsāra), but the man who has performed 'praṇāma to Śrī Kṛṣṇa never returns". In accordance with the truths revealed in these ślokas, we should interpret the following texts without circumscribing the potency of prapatti, in so far as it does not conflict with the meaning of the śāstra :.- "He who performs prapatti only once and says, “I am Thine"-to him I grant freedom from fear of all beings. This is my vow", " If you are afraid of sin, O Bharata, desist from all action and remain with the thought that Nārāyaṇa is alone the object to be attained by all possible means ", and “Even if a man born of a low caste performs prapatti to the Lord and that only once, the Lord protects him even if he has murdered his father and mother",

[^78]: Sukṛta praṇāma consists in folding the two hands in añjali thrice and in performing aṣṭāṅga namaskāram twelve times touching the ground with the brow, the nose, the eyes and the cheeks.

"The Lord protects him even if he has murdered his father and his mother" - Only when this has not been committed after prapatti, will this śloka not be opposed to the rule concering prayascitta. If it be done after prapatti, we have already shown how redemption could be obtained. In this way also could be easily explained such passages as this :- "Good men protect those who have sought their protection and who pray to them saying, "I am yours", even though they have murdered their fathers".

THE POTENCY OF PRAPATTI.

There may be some who are followers of our Viśiṣṭādvaita darśana, who are aspirants to mukti and have sought the protection of Bhagavān through any one of the following paths prescribed in the śāstra, viz., karma  yoga, jñāna yoga, bhakti  yoga or prapatti, but who are still in the earlier stages of yoga like **Yatamana sanjna, when they have just begun to control the senses. On finding in such men certain diseases like desire for money not completely cured, some to whom freedom from all desires is all important (even more than devotion to Bhagavān) would call them ignorant men unfit to be talked to. But this is improper as pointed out in the Bhagavat Śāstra in the sections dealing with the professions followed by those who suffer from poverty. What has been said about those who follow the wrong path should not be applied to those who follow the right path but stumble in it (occasionally). About the former it has been said: "No gifts should be received from those who observe dharma hypocritically for the sake of praise, from rationalists, from heretics and from those who are like cranes (ever bent on catching fish while appearing like one in contemplation): "They are to be considered heretics who consider Bhagavān to be like others. They are unfit for the performance of all (śāstraic) rites", and "Those who wear matted locks as an ornament and who have shaved their heads bat who eat without performing yajna to the gods and the like, who are without any purity and who omit the performance of tarpanas and sraddhas to their forefathers (pitṛs)-even by talking to such persons men go to Hell". (What has been said in these ślokas does not apply to those who have only slipped or stumbled while following the right path).

NO OFFENCE SHOULD EVER BE COMMITTED

AGAINST BHĀGAVATAS :

Anong Bhāgavatas, it is true that degrees of regard have been prescribed for those who have not received the purification by fire[^79] (or who have not done the rites or karma  ordained for thern), who have not the.purification due to the wearing of the caste mark ( puṅḍra) (or who have given up their sūtra ), who have not had the purification due to nāma (or who have renounced their gurus, gods and the like), and those who have not been initiated into the sacred mantras (or who have no association with good men). But even these will obtain redemption by some means or other (prāyaśćitta and the like) (provided they have not deviated from their exclusive devotion (to Bhagavān). The śāstras have, indeed, laid down the rule that offences should not be committed even against these (men). What has been said of the potency of karma  yoga in the following ślokas applies even more to that of bhakti and prapatti: “The endeavour that has been commenced in this karma -yoga never ends in vain; there is no offence if it is not completed; even a small fraction of this dharma redeems a n:an from measureless saṁsāra”, and “The "man who has begun yoga but has not completed it never perishes either here or in the higher world. (Is it not clear) that the man who has done a good thing will not meet with an evil end?" Further the Supreme Ruler Himself said to Arjuna and Dharma. putra respectively :--"Even "if a man is of impure ways, if he worships me without the desire for any other fruit, he is certainly a good man (sādhu). He is worthy of esteem, for his intentions are good", and "Even" if my devotees are inclined to sin, no sin will cling to them, in the same way as water does not stain the leaf of the lotus".

[^79]: The marks of the conch and the discus (chakra) made with red-hot iron on the two upper arms.

It has (also) been said in the discourse between Puṇḍarīka and Nārada :- He who has sought the protection of the Lord, O best of Brahmins, whether he be clad in a garment of bark, whether he wears matted locks (jatā), whether he holds a triad of sticks (like a sannyāsin), whether he has shaved his head clean or whether he bears the marks of other āśramas or whether he has not any of them- (it does not matter)-  for these are not the causes that win mokṣa. Even those who have no pity, who have wicked minds and are always inclined to evil ways --- even they attain the highest state, provided they have sought the protection of Nārāyaṇa": "If the devotees of Viṣṇu commit sins, the sins will not taint them, because they will perform prāyaścitta at once. They purify the whole world like the rising sun." "The man in whom, at the end of thousands of virtuous lives, arises the thought that he is the servant of Vāsudeva, who is the Supreme Self in all the worlds -- that man will go to the world of Bhagavān. There is no doubt of this. (Such being the case), is it necessary to speak of those who, with the seoses under control, have fixed their souls in Bhagavān". In these ślokas, it is stated that, even if devotees of Bhagavān continue to sin, they will doubtless attain mukti by performing prayascitta and that (this being so) much more easily will sinless men attain mukti, further the great sage declared also this, among other truths, that those who have no devotion to Bhagavān will never attain the desired goal even by superior deeds of virtue: "Those  who do not turn their faces to Nārāyaṇa will never reach the desired goal, even though they have performed a hundred horse-sacrifices and many hundreds of Vajapeya sacrifices".

Since it has been said -- "He who understands Śrī Kṛṣṇa as He is even the gods cannot know the extent of his greatness", even the eternal sūris cannot indeed measure his greatness. Therefore, even if sufferings afflict the devotees of Bhagavān who have continued to commit offences deliberately, they should not be treated with disregard. Has it not been stated as follows:- "By bowing before those who are not devotees of Viṣṇu, by speaking of Bhagavān with irreverence, and by the vilification of the devotee of Viṣṇu, (by all these), a man will surely have his fall. There is no doubt of this"? " The man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - let him vilify sanıyāsins always; let him treat with disregard the devotees of Viṣṇu, let him be averse to (the study of) Vedānta, let the man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be outwardly good, but inwardly wicked; let him hate those who know Brahman, and censure the rites and observances prescribed in the śāstras. Let the man who has stolen the bulb of the lotus be ever perverse in his intelligence and delude those who follow the right code of conduct and who have no firm faith in the śāstra which treats of the jīva and the Paramātmā".

The author of Śrī Bhāṣya has, in his Śaraṇāgati Gadyanı spoken of offence to Bhagavān and the like ((i.e.) offence to His devotees) along with the sins of omission and commission (while they too are sins of omission and commission). This is to indicate that offence to Bhagavān (and to Bhāgavatas) is extremely serious, as when we speak of bovine cattle and bulls, the bull is mentioned separately, though it is included in "bovine cattle", simply to emphasise the bull. All sins are, of course, offences against Bhagavān. So the separate mention of some kinds of sin is to refer to offences against Bhagavān and His devotees. Śrī Rāmānuja's aim in this separate mention, is to state that whatever offences may be committed against others, if similar offences are committed against Bhagavān or His devotees, they would, by their very nature, lead to more severe punishments just, like treason against kings. The sphere of saṁsāra is, as it were, the nursery to Hell. Such being the case, it is very difficult to find in it people who walk in the right path. So to think ill of those who follow, in regard to Bhagavān, any one of the paths like karma  yoga, which are like the first steps leading to mukti, in accordance with their competence (adhikāra), is to commit an offence against the devotees of Bhagavān.

When it is said :-" There 'is no mukti for one who is extremely devoted to the science of grammar (Sabda Śāstra), for one who sets much store by food and clothing, for one who delights in living in a beautiful house and (as also), for one who is able to allure the minds of the people in the world by one's speech ", it means (that there is no mukti for them) when there is no devotion to Bhagavān. The same is the meaning of the śloka :- “Those who are addicted to the pleasures of sex and to good food, and those who commit (the offences of) theft, uttering falsehoods and speaking harsh words, are men that have given up dharma and the gods avoid them and keep at a distance from them on that account." The same is also the purport of such ślokas as the following :Those whose minds are firmly fixed on the pleasures of the senses while being averse to Govinda - from then, that Supreme Brahman is at a great distance". So also it is said:-" To those? who always think of Govinda and whose minds are firmly fixed on Hin ma to them Bhagavān may be considered to be always at hand". Such passages declare that there will be no delay (in attaining mukti) for those who are devoted to Bhagavān and who have, at the same time, given up the pleasures of the senses.

Even those who wander about in the disguise of the devotees of Bhagavān without any devotion at heart to Him and who are therefore like tigers wrapped in the skin of the cow for the purpose of springing on cows -- even these are to be treated with respect for their appearance and for their names (Bhāgavatas), in the same way as Uparichara and others treated such persons as the Asuras, until their inner nature was revealed. It is in regard to these actors by profession that (we find) the saying :-"The outward mark is not the cause of dharma" and "Though the fruit of the soap-nut" tree has the property of rendering (muddy) water clear, yet the water is not rendered clear by the mere utterance of its name".

THE UTTERANCE OF BHAGAVAN'S NAME PURIFIES

ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOT HATE HIM.

From the ślokas and Tamil verses that follow, it should not be understood that the mere mention of Bhagavān's name, though in contempt or vilification, will destroy all sins:-"Thos (who suffer from troubles), who are miserable, who have no steady foothold anywhere, who are afraid of saṁsāra and who are afflicted with terrible diseases - (all these) obtain freedom (from their ills) by the mere mention of the word 'Nārāyaṇa' and become happy". The man who, even without his being aware of it, pronounces the name of Bhagavān, is freed from all sins, in the same way as a forest is freed from deer owing to the fear of a lion", "The mention of Bhagavān's name - though it be to call a person who (merely) bears that name, though it be in irony, though it be pronounced wrongly, though it be in derision -(the mere mention of His name) will destroy all sins". "Hari destroys all sins when he is remembered even by men with evil hearts. Even if fire is touched unawares, it certainly burns." "The mentions of many of the names of Bhagavān which describe his attributes and actions is much more than is necessary). The mention of a single name is enough; for Ajamila, sinful though he was, attained mukti by calling his son 'Nārāyaṇa' at the time of his death". "Kshatrabandhu" attained the highest state by the mention of the name 'Govinda' with its three syllables, though he was in the midst of past evil deeds which surrounded him like ants. Why then, should we suffer from saṁsāra, while we have Śrī Raṅganātha who is so inordinately fond as to be easily accessible towards His servants." (All these passages should not be taken as literally true). They only mean that, if the man has no hatred for Bhagavān, the mention of Bhagavān's name is extremely purificatory, though his faith in Bhagavān is weak, though he utters the name like children and the like without a knowledge of its meaning, though he blabbers the name without any thought, though, his intentions being different, he utters the same as a conventional name or in irony and the like, though he is associated with other aims and though he has faults. Certainly it does not mean that derisive speech concerning Bhagavān and the like would destroy sins. Derisive speech and the like concerning Bhagavān have indeed been counted among the deadly sins (pataka). Has it not been said: "They who hate the Supreme Self and do not remember Keśava -- they will not find any good in bathing in the holy waters - nor those who associate with them (out of regard)" and also :-- "The son that hates his father should be looked upon as born to somebody else. He who always hates Bhagavān should be looked upon as being born to a man of the lowest caste"?

It is said in the Bhāgavatam :-"The Gopis attained mukti by love (to Śrī Kṛṣṇa); Kamsa out of fear (of Śrī Kṛṣṇa), Sisupala and other kings by hatred (to Śrī Kṛṣṇa), the Vrishnis owing to their relationship; you ( the Pandavas) out of friendship to him and we (Nārada  and others) by devotion". It states that, in some way or other (fear, hatred, love, friendship etc.), those who are associated with Śrī Kṛṣṇa will obtain redemption, provided they have done good deeds in the past. The same idea is found also in the śloka :- " Associations with Bhagavān, who is ever pure, whatever be the form it takes, will destroy sins". These two ślokas refer to individuals who had a special competency owing to good deeds done in past lives. This is well-known from the purāṇas which relate the earlier and the later incidents in their lives. (It should not be considered applicable to others.)

RESIDENCE IN HOLY PLACES.

The statement (in certain passages) that the parting from life in certain holy places of Bhagavān will help the attainment of mukti should be understood as applicable only to those who are not ill-disposed to Bhagavān, though, in their indifference, they may be like animals. If not understood in this manner, it would follow that even those who are bent on doing what is displeasing to the Lord would attain mukti (which is absurd).

he passage in the Sātvata Saṁhitā, which says: "The mind that is impure owing to subjection to the wild senses -- that mind becomes pure in the last days by living in the holy places of Nārāyaṇa" - this passage only means to say that though such men could not realise Bhagavān formerly owing to their addiction to such pleasures as those of the senses which are not opposed to the śāstras, they will attain purity of mind in their last days". This is evident from the context in Sātvata Saṁhitā (where the passage is found.) “He whom the yogis endeavour by their efforts to fix in their minds at the time of separation from the body". He enters into their minds without any effort on their part in their last moments. This much superiority they have. This is shown also in the case of prapannas of whom it is said:  They attain to a clear vision merely by My Grace".

Therefore to those who are inimical to Bhagavān, there is no redemption by these marks which serve their enmity - namely, appearance, bearing the name of Bhagavān, residence in a holy place, and the utterance of His names",

Things which are displeasing to the Lord, when done in holy places, contribute very greatly to ruin and this is well-known from many śāstras. This is also due to the might of Bhagavān.

To those who are devoted to Bhagavān, whatever acts they do in order to please Him, will, as in the case of Vritra and Kshatra bandhu, themselves destroy all sins and will be the cause of their redemption by some vyāja or gesture.

Sach being the case, Iśvara, who has already made up His mind to grant, to these devotees (who may have some faults also), the blessings of mukti to which they are entitled by their nature, -- Iśvara will ( by some punishment or other means) enable them to expiate their offences. So we should clearly understand that Iśvara is the only controller of whom it is said: "He alone" is the Ruler who controls: there is no second controller." . "Know that" He is the controller over all: He is more subtle than the subtlest ;" and "He who dwells within the heart - He controls the whole world: by whom else is any man controlled ?" (With this knowledge in our minds ) we should refrain from treating with disregard these devotees on the strength of what is said in such passages as this : The slayer" of Madhu ( Madhusūdana) does not remain in the mind of the man which is impure owing to such things as (evil) desires; the swan never delights in water that is muddy." On the other hand, we should feel delighted at any good features that might be found in such devotees, even as in finding water in a wilderness.

It has been said :-"Whatever a man often does with the activities of his body, mind and speech - it makes a man its captive. Therefore one should (ever) perform what is good. So we should never deviate from the right path with the body, mind or speech.There is a saying that "The poison tree called saṁsāra bears two (kinds of) fruits which are like nectar - one is bhakti  to Bhagavān and the other association with those who are His bhaktas". Therefore we should feel it a blessing that we have obtained the unattainable privilege of association with those really great men who may appear small (in the eyes of the ignorant) and who have the great good fortune of having sought the protection of the Supreme Being, for this should be the great object of desire during our life. time here. We should rest assured "that evil" deeds can never be ours, as we have been accepted by the Lord (as His servants)", and "That the Lord who wields the chakra (the discus) protects us and that (therefore) no one can do anything harmful to us." We should therefore crown ourselves, even here, in anticipation of the empireship of perfect service to the Lord which will be ours in Heaven (Paramapada). This potency which has been determined so far should be remembered in connection with such places as indicate the fruit in the three mysteries (mantras), as established by necessary consequence.

The Supreme Self whose greatness is described in the Vedas, which reveal the truth, is beyond all limitations and beyond all measure in regard to His glory. Therefore, about those who approach Him and seek His feet, though such things as low birth and certain weaknesses may be found in them, yet it cannot be said that their greatness is, in any way, limited. This truth has been taught to us by those who are highest among men and who are free from all partiality.

When the eternal Saviour, who cannot, in the least, be affected by such great demons as desire, hatred, pride and the like is present (to save us), that tapas or upāya called the surrender of the responsibility of our protection (bharanyāsa), which is accepted as transcending all other dharmas (upāyas) in putting down all adharmas -- that tapas is so great that the description of even a fragment of the ocean of its potency is beyond the range of even the ancient Vedas.
