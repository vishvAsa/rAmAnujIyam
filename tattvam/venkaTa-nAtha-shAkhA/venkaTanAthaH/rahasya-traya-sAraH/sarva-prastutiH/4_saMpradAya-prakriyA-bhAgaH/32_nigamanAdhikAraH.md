There may be found someone who, by the grace of his ācārya, has seen (the truths concerning) the Universe (as distinctly) as if they were a jubube berry (Badari fruit) in the hand, whose illusions have been dispelled and who enjoys (the meanings contained in) such mysteries (mantras) as the mūlamantra. When a worthy śiṣya having the necessary virtues has been found, he instructs him in the spiritual tradition and gleans, for his own observances, all that is good in the conduct and observances of great men and becomes worthy (himself) of the appreciation of the hosts of the eternal sūris.

TOPICS TREATED OF SO FAR page640

Here (in this treatise), we have set forth, just as we learnt them ourselves and just as we believe them to be true in our heart of hearts, without giving room to any ignorance, doubt or misconception, the following topics of knowledge in accordance with what is sanctioned by the śrutis, the smṛtis, the sūtras and the ancient tradition and in accordance also with right reason: (1) How the jīvatma whose essential nature is such that he is fit to enjoy the bliss of Bhagavan just like the suris - how he has lost this fitness from beginningless time, how later he acquires the spirit of detachment (vairāgya) in some measure, how he comes in contact with a worthyācārya from whom he begins to learn the truths and the means of attaining the ends desired by him; (2) how among the pramāṇas or valid sources of knowledge, the three secrets or mysteries (mantras), are of the greatest importance; (3) how, among the meanings revealed in these (mantras), such things as the relationship of soul and body that exists between the Supreme Ruler and those which are ruled over by Him are the central and most essential doctrines to be learnt (4) how the five subjects of knowledge (artha. pañcaka) including that relationship which have been summarised by our ancientācāryas are contained in the three great secrets or mysteries (mantras) (5) what the chief aim is of those who, among these five subjects of knowledge, devote themselves to a classification and study of the three tattvas or Reals (6) how among these three Reals or tattvas, Iśvara, who is described in the sātvika śāstras is the Lord with His spouse Śrī (viz. Nārāyaṇa).(7) how the man who has clearly learnt these subjects becomes eager for mukti and seeks the upāyas for mukti (8) the classification of those who are competent to adopt the different upāyas, (9) the classification of upāyas suitable for the competency of different individuals (10) how, among the upāyas, the man who wants to adopt prapatti as a direct and independent upāya should have certain characteristics or marks of competence (11) the classification of accessories enjoined as appropriate for this upāyas which has to le performed only once (12) the nature of this important duty called the surrender of the burden or responsibility (concerning the self) with its accessories, to be performed by the man (13) how the man that has performed this prapatti with its aṅgas has done what he ought to do, in as much as he has surrendered the responsibility to one who is the Universal Saviour (14) the signs or marks by which a man could realise that this state has been attained by him (15) how, if he is not so impatient as to pray for inmediate release (by death), he should, for the rest of his life, render service (to Bhagavān and His devotees) as befitting one whose essential nature (svarūpa) is that of a śeṣa (16) how the service to Bhagavān extends as far as service to His devotees (17) how this service should be rendered in accordance with the regulations prescribed in the śāstras, since what is against the liking of the Master, who is the Ruler, cannot be called service (at all) (18) the ways in which or the means by which the man who has entered on his career of service in accordance with the śāstras could avoid offences from being committed in future and expiate or atone for those committed in the past, (19) how the fit place for the residence of the man who is to render faultless service in times free froin danger or serious adversity is the place where there are temples sacred to the Lord and which are (therefore) resorted to by His devotees. (20) how, to the man who has been living such a life, the soul's departure from the gross body may take place, by the peculiar will of the Saviour, in any place and at any time irrespective of their being usually considered worthy or unworthy (21) how the self that has started (from the body) proceeds, like a prince invited by his father to his installation as heir-apparent, in full glory to travel along the arcirādi route to Paramapada, (22) how after reaching there, the self will have the full and perfect enjoyment of Bhagavān which will include also free and voluntary service or kaiṅkarya and which is the supreme state of Lordship reserved for the mukta (23) the Siddhopāya which is the most important of what are to be known (24) the sādhyopāya which is the most important of those things that are to be performed (25) and (26) the ways in which misconceptions arising frou impure food, from association (with undesirable persons) as also from the character of the yuga and the like should be removed, misconceptions in regard to the potency of this upāya in relation to the man who has adopted it, misconceptions which describe its potency as higher or lower than what is stated in the śāstras (27, 28 & 29 ) the construction and interpretation of the words and the sentences in the three secrets or mysteries (mantras) which enable a man to meditate on all these points, (30) the regulations in regard to the imparting of instruction and the refraining from it, which have to be kept in mind by the ācārya who has to propagate a knowledge of the spiritual tradition concerning these truths in accordance with the śāstras and (31) the duties expected of the śiṣya who, on account of his inability to recompense his āchārya adequately has to remain eternally indebted to him ---

THE GOOD RESULTS THAT WILL FOLLOW FROM

A STUDY OF THIS TREATISE:

The śiṣya should, at first, approach the goodācārya in the proper manner and beg of him in these words : "I am your pupil and have sought you (for guidance). (Therefore) command me as to what I should do". He should listen (to the ācārya's discourse) with reverence and close attention and should also glean with care the advice which would supplement (what is taught by the ācārya) as stated in the following śloka :- “One should observe the wise words of great men and their virtuous ways of life and glean from them whatever is required for oneself, in the same way as some live on the grain gleaned in the fields. He should try to have a clear understanding of what is taught therein by repeated study.

It has been said: "The dharma followed by the good is too subtle, O monkey, to be easily understood" and "There is no end to arguments. The Vedas are diverse; the rishis from whose words truth could be ascertained are many. The truth regarding dharma is hid (as it were) in a cave," and also, " Dharma' is more subtle than the sharp edge of a razor. Who is there competent to declare what it is ? " Thus where even sages have to tread with the greatest care, we have to follow what is stated in the following ślokas :- "The way that is followed by great men is the way (to be followed by others)" and "Whatever is said, even in sport, by Brahmins seated in the chariot of the dharma śāstras and armed with the sword of the Vedas --(Whatever is said by them) is considered as supreme dharma". Therefore to walk along the path followed by the ancientācāryas who depended solely on the śrutis and the smṛtis and cleared the way so that it may be free from hindrances - to walk along this way is not improper for us. To those who walk along this path, there will be no such painful anxieties as those feit by great sages when they said :- "There is no rest house, no staff for support, no food (on the route) and no one to guide us. It is the path which leads to hell and is too dark to walk along. How will you

traverse it alone ?" and “The path leading to the house of Yama where there is no water for quenching the thirst, no staff for support, no shade to sit under, no house or lodge to rest in and which produces prolonged suffering." To one who follows the track of great men, there would be no such painful paths. They need not be tossed about to and fro like cotton cleaned of its seeds, combed, and carded before being spun and go up and come down, like the bucket in a picotah[‍?] , along the path of smoke (dhūmādi route)[^123] described in the Pañcāgni vidyā in the sixth chapter of Chāndogya upaniṣad,

[^123]: Going up to svarga and coming down to this world of saṁsāra after the fruits of good deeds have been enjoyed there and repeating this process.

It has been said :-- "O. Lord,' Thou playest, as with balls, with creatures bound by the strings of karma  and going up and coming down". To the man who follows the ways of great men, the state when he is thus a toy for the sport of Bhagavān will soon pass away. He will then go along a path which is superior to the paths followed by others to attain high ends (like svarga), because it will lead to an end or goal greater than all others and will never result in a return to saṁsāra. It has been said:- "I know' that the path which will be trodden by the man who has exclusive devotion to Bhagavān is far superior to others" and likewise, “He, ( the jīva ) starts from the body by an excellent path, which is so cool as to remove the sufferings of saṁsāra." and further, "to those "who have practised yoga, (all) sufferings will cease and they will then journey by the Deva yāna route," This excellent path will terminate in the region (Paramapada) described in the following ślokas -- " It is a 'splendid region on reaching which the self will become (itself), (i. e.) free from avidyā and consequently from suffering," " The abode of the Supreme Being, Viṣṇu, shines far more than the sun or the fire.

It is so dazzlingly bright that even the gods and asuras cannot gaze at it," “Those great souls who have completed their practice of yoga and have become free from ignorance and illusion reach that region from which there is no return to this world of saṁsāra." "When compared with the region where the Supreme Being abides, this svarga and other worlds are, my child, like bells". This path (Devayāna) will terminate in Paramapada which is declared in the śrutis also as the ultimate terminus of the route leading away from saṁsāra. The self (that takes that path) will have, for its supporting staff, the grace of Bhagavān, and will have, for the victuals of its journey, the delight in the thought that it will (soon) attain the supreme end of life. As stated in the Brahma-sūtras "' He will start" from there by the opening of the vein (nāḍi) indicated and lighted by the Lord who dwells within the heart" and take the arcirādi route along which, in the respective regions of the gods, he would be greeted and welcomed with honours befitting emperors by the respective deities thereof with auspicious lamps and pitchers full of water (pūrṇakumbha) and attended by their followers. They will escort the self on its path and those deities to whom the man made offerings in the world of karma  before will (now) pay tributes to his self. The self then passes into regions which are beyond their range and attains a supreme perfection which would make it difficult for it to be distinguished from the eternal sūris when it enters their assembly. The self will then reach under the two feet of the Supreme „Ruler and His consort who are resting on a couch in Paramapada, the like of which has been described in the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa in connection with the avatars as their manner of being seated:  Then he saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa seated on a throne made of gold and adorned with gems and looking like a blue cloud resting on Mount Meru. His form was radiant and adorned with ornaments of unsurpassed brilliance; he was dressed in a raiment of gold and shone like a blue gem set in gold; on his chest shone the gem kaustubha and He was like a mountain lighted up by the sun and had a crown on His head. Such was His appearance that, in all the three worlds, there could be found no one to be set in comparison with him?" and “Sumantra, the charioteer, saw Śrī Rāma seated like Kubera on a throne made of gold and having a beautiful coverlet. His body was covered with the paste of sandal red like the blood of the boar, pure, fragrant and of superior quality. Sītā was standing by him with a cāmara in her hand, like the star Citra near the moon, His splendour is like that of the sun. Sumantra, who knew the etiquette (suited to courts), bowed with respect to the invincible Śrī Rāma who ever gave what was asked of him." (Having reached the feet of the Supreme Being, the self will receive the privilege of rendering all kinds of service suited to all places, all times and all circumstances and be forever blissful as prayed for in the verse :- “We should render, so constantly and without intermission, service to the Lord - such service as will be most appropriate to all times, to all places and to all occasions".

Thus (both) in the state of endeavour (upāya) and in the state of attainment, the holy feet of Nārāyaṇa, the Lord of Śrī, are our support.

The feet of Śrī Raṅganātha, ever true to their devotees can never be given up; they were once awake to the danger from a mighty wheel (the forın taken by an asura) and hy touching it they made it break into pieces): on another occasion, they crawled on all fours and caused the two Maruda trees which grew close to each other to fall down; on the occasion of His searching (for butter) in the pots haṅgīng from above, they stood indistinguishable from the mortar to which they were bound (by Yasoda), (On a later day), they gladly consented to go on the mission assigned to them by the virtuous Dharmaputra; they came to Brindavan to bring about the destruction of the wicked asuras; while gently stroked by the hand of Lakṣmī, they became red like the petals of the lotus; they were favourable to the devotion shown by the great sages who wanted freedom from the bondage of births; they rested in a wonderful vimana (having a resemblance to praṇava), which was an object of worship to kings of the race of Manu; they shone in the chariot of the righteous Arjuna during the great war; they were inflamed with wrath when they danced on the cruel hoods of the serpent, Kaliya, and made them break down; they rested in a region (Paramapada) that could not be (even) imagined by the six systems of philosophical thought; they became the subjects of praise in the tongue of the Alvar (Nammalvar), who was the glory of the beautiful city of Kurugai; they had, for ornaments, the fragrant flowers of Tulasi; they showed their glory by graciously transforming the fallen piece of charcoal into a child (Parikṣit); they chased the armies of the asuras to their destruction.

Of what avail is anger towards those Vedic scholars who teach the knowledge which they have of the truths, and the way of casting off illusions and errors, as also the nature of the self (as the śeṣa of the Lord), the unique compassion of the Lord shown to those who are destitute of upāyas, and the carefree state arising from holding on to the Lord as a refuge as taught in the three mysteries (mantras)? We have spoken (thus far) to those who can appreciate excellence.

These states of mind in regard to one's essential nature, the upāyas and the end to be attained (which are explained in this treatise) and which are understood only with effort by even those who are in Paramapada are indeed possible of attainment even here in this world of saṁsāra. This treatise, though decried by perverse minds bent (only) on finding faults, will be found sweet by the Supreme Ruler whose lotus-like feet overflow with honey.

The Lord whose face resembles that of a white horse (Hayagrīva) assumed the form of myācārya and, by that device, wrote these truths in my mind and I have (only) transcribed them on these leaves. The part played by me is none other than this. Whether this treatise is accepted as worthy or rejected as unworthy, my clear mind, ( men of critical minds, will feel neither elated nor depressed in the least.
