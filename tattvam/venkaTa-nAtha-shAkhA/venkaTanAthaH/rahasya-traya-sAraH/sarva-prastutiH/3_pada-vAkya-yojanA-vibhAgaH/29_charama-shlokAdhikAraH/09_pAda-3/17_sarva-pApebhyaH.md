Sin is the cause of evil and what it is can be understood from the śāstras. Evil means 'becoming subject to what is disagreeable and losing what is agreeable.' Here (in the carama - śloka) sin denotes also acts of merit (puṇya) which lead to enjoyment in saṁsāra (which includes svarga), for they, too, are to the aspirant to mukti, productive of undesirable fruits. It has been said:-"This svarga and other such places are, my child, like hell when compared with the abode of the Supreme Being". Thus to the aspirant to mukti, even such places as svarga are like hell. In the case of the aspirant, therefore, that which leads to svarga is, in no way, different from that which leads to hell. That is why the aspirant to mukti is enjoined to give up those means which lead to dharma, artha (wealth) and kāma (pleasure), in the same way as he is enjoined to give up sinful actions. Indeed the Śrutis and the Smṛtis declare that good deeds and evil deeds are both to be avoided by the aspirant to mukti, for it is stated "Giving up puṇya and papa of which are both of the nature, karma which are hard to give up etc."



Thus having denoted, by the word pāpa (sins), both puṇya and pāpa, which are the causes of bondage, the śloka indicates, by the plural of the word pāpa (viz. pāpebhyah), their being countless. If so, it may be asked what purpose is served by the word sarva (all). (The answer is) the word 'all' is used for the purpose of including among the hosts of sins, avidyā or ignorance, the past impressions (vāsanas) which create a liking for adverse things, the taste (ruchi) for evil things and the contact with prakṛti or matter both in its gross state and in its subtle state (in pralaya), for these are the causes of karma  and also the products of karma. (In the Śaraṇāgati Gadya), Śrī Rāmānuja has, in three clauses cūrṇikas, indicated, both explicitly by the words themselves and implicitly from their meaning, those hindrances or obstacles which are referred to in ‘all sins’. The three passages begin with manovākkāyaih' (by mind, speech and body).



(A question might arise in this connection):- It is said, “Having administered the affairs entrusted to them by the Lord for a long time and again and again, they reach the end of their karma  and attain mukti, where jīvas who were formerly Brahmas, Indras, and Rudras, are enjoying bliss in Paramapada (the supreme abode)." (So also) it is said: "Those that have been appointed (by the Supreme Being) to be administrators should remain here in the world of saṁsāra) until the expiry of their period of administration". (We find also the following :-) The man who adopts a bhakti  or upāsana as the means will have the benefit of the destruction (the fruits of) such karmas (puṇya and pāpa) as have not begun to yield their consequences at the very beginning of this upāsana; for (it is said) that there will be delay (for their attaining mukti) till the enjoyment is completed of those karmas that have began to operate (prā rabdha). This is applicable even to those who are not administrators. The question may be asked:- "If so, what is the meaning of saying that the Lord will pardon also in the case of the prapanna) those karma s which have began to operate and yield their fruits ?" The answer is as follows:- “Even in the case of karmas which have begun to bear fruit, if the man who has adopted prapatti as the direct and independent upāya considers as evil and undesirable those parts which would lead to another birth or (even) another day's existence and grieves on that account, Iśvara will give him pardon even in respect of all that karma. If the prapanna is so impatient as to feel that he cannot bear to live without the immediate attainment of mokṣa, the lord will, at that very instant, pardon even all that karma  which has begun to bear fruit so that no trace of it may be left over. Therefore there is no reason why one should not pray for pardon even in respect of that karma  which has begun to bear fruit (prārabdha).



(In the Śaraṇāgatigadya  Śrī Rāmānuja says:-) "Pardon all sins without exception, (sins) past, future, and present - committed by the mind, the speech, or the body." Here past (sins) refer to those committed before prapatti and future (sins) refer to those that might be committed after the performance of prapatti. We do not see any sins committed at the instant of performing prapatti. What, then, is the meaning of present (kriyamāṇa) sins? (The answer is):- By the word 'present' (kriyamāṇa) is meant that which was begun before and which will be completed in future? According to this definition, those sins which were begun before and which require a long time for their completion and thus that might be done on account of negligence or carelessness at the instant of performing prapatti - these are called present (sins) - Future (sins) are those that may begin after prapatti. Among those sins which are committed after prapatti and which may be partly of the present and partly of the future, those which are not committed deliberately will be pardoned by Iśvara and will leave no trace at all (on the self). Those that are committed deliberately can be atoned for by the performance again of prapatti, for it is said:-"If an offence be committed, expiation should be made therefor and the expiation to be made is only the performance of prapatti again." When it is said that if Iśvara is bent on granting mokṣa, even deadly sins cannot stand in the way, and that there will be no punishment for sins committed delibe. rately after prapatti, what is meant is not that there is no need for expiation or prāyaścitta, but that if Iśvara is again propitiated by prapatti, (which is the prāyaścitta), mokṣa is sure to follow. It is the result of God's forgiveness that the man is induced to perform expiation by a further prapatti.



It has been said (by some ācāryas) that, to Iśvara, the sins or offences of the jīva are (agreeable) like the dirt on the body of a beloved wife and like the slime on the body of the newborn calf to the cow. This only means that even if wicked men should perform prapatti, Iśvara will not forsake them and will bring them round to righteous ways. It does not mean that sins committed deliberately would give delight to Iśvara. If so, the prapanna should have, by all the means in his power, to commit such sins.



Even if offences are committed deliberately owing to the peculiar nature of a man's prakṛti, and even if a further prapatti is not performed (by way of expiation), it is the peculiar characteristic of Iśvara's forgiveness that He sees to it that such prapannas do not go to hell and that He awards them light punishments (sufferings) as (kings do) in the case of their offending sons. Sins lead to sufferings that are seen and that are tangible and also to sufferings like those in hell. So when it is said that there is no hell for the prapanna as in the following ślokas :- “Those who consider Viṣṇu, the bearer of ṣārṅga, as the supreme end of life and who perform prapatti to Him never go to the world of Yama" and “Whatever be the family into which they are born, and wherever they may live, those who are ever attached to Vāsudeva never go to hell" when such statements are made to the effect that there is no hell for them, there is nothing in them to deny that they will not have any sufferings in this life itself (like blindness). Logic cannot repudiate explicit statements (made in the śruti and the smṛti). It is idle to say that, even in some of those who have committed offences and who have not repented for them by performing a further prapatti. we do not see such visible sufferings as blindness which are stated to be their punishments. Even in their lives, we may see such sufferings as the following in accordance with the seriousness of their offences :-- many varieties of suffering due to the three well-known causes (the elements of nature, the body and supernatural powers), dullness of the intelligence required for the Lord's service, the diminution of delight and the absence of it in the enjoyment of Bhagavān, the absence of delight in rendering service to Bhagavān and His devotees, offences against the Lord and His devotees, the censure, the boycott and the like by the virtuous, the destruction of their good deeds, the loss of the esteem in which they were formerly held by good men, the suffering done in the frustration of their ambitions and desires, and such other  forms of sorrow. It is well-known from the śrutis, the Dharma śāstras of Manu and others and from the Itihasas, Purāṇas and the Pāñcarātra that, for varied kinds of sins of omission and commission, there are varied kinds of visible suffering. Therefore when blindness and the like are taken by way of example, it should be taken only as one instance (and not as an invariable form of suffering). This is evident from the opening words of the sentence which speak of sufferings in the world in general,



It is not possible to argue, with any certainty, that the varied sufferings which come to a man as the fruit of sins committed deliberately after prapatti and which find support in the authority of the texts are due to past karma  which has begun to yield its fruit. These may come as the result of either of the two kinds of karma . That is why good men (sātvikas) dread offences that might be committed deliberately. If this were otherwise, it would be opposed to the śāstra which enjoins a further prapatti and to the code of conduct followed by virtuous men and to ancient tradition.



(It is true) Nanjiyar stated that if a man does not feel repentant after committing an offence, he should be considered as without knowledge. But what is meant is that his omission to repent is due to dullness of intelligence and not that the prapatti was not fulfilled. Deliberate offences which would meet with Bhagavān's disapproval would not be committed by some men as these result from conditions created by past karma . In the case of some others who commit such offences, repentance and the like put an end to them. Men of hard hearts may not repent at all. Therefore if deliberate offences happen to be committed, the man should repent and perform prapatti again. If he does not, they would lead to light punishments or sufferings in accordance with what is said in the śrutis and the like.

Wise men who have performed prapatti would never think of committing offences deliberately, men of a mediocre intelligence repent (for such offences.) Hard - hearted men meet with punishment for them.



Therefore in order that there may be no punishment of any kind, one should guard against deliberate offences.

When one performs the commands of the omnipotent Lord (nitya and naimittika karma ) solely for the purpose of pleasing Him, no punishment will ensue, though he may not have thought (of avoiding any such punishment).



If a prapanna should try, as much as it lies in his power, to avoid offences, he should avoid. even more carefully, offences against the devotees of Bhagavān and association with those who commit such offences.

The countless and serious sins committed by the man who meditates on Brahman (Brahmavit) will be transferred to the man who hates him. Realising this, one should dread committing any offence against a Brahmavit.



Even by associating with one who has offended against the devotees of Brahman, a man will incur sins. (At the same time) a man should not hate one who offends against the devotees of Iśvara, who alone is competent to punish him.

The Lord, whose will is irresistible and who creates, in the minds of those who do not care for him, all their desires and who also frustrates them -- the Lord has turned my mind today froni saṁsāra or bondage and has placed me beneath His two feet for protection. He has been pleased to forget His wrath caused by my actions in the past prompted by my mind before the performance of prapatti and has appeared already (as avatars and arcā) to grant me mukti. He smiles gently, wondering whether we shall accept His grace today or tomorrow.
