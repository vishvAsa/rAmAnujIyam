Thus in the first half of the carama śloka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa **enjoins**,  
for a particular person (adhikārī),  
the **adoption** of that upāya (prapatti)  
which **is referred to** in the first part of Dvaya  
and which **has** (in itself) the potency of all dharmas or rites  
and, at the same time a peculiar and unique potency of its own  
which none of them **possesses**  
(for it **can destroy** even that karma  
which has already **begun to operate**  
and **yield** its consequences). 

He has explained that this upāya does not require any special or ancillary dharmas on the part of the adhikārī and has to be performed only once. In the second half of the śloka, he graciously explains, at length, the fruit to be attained (by adopting this upāya), which is (only) briefly indicated by the word namas in the second part of Dvaya. In the first half of the śloka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa stated that which has to be done by the person or adhikārī (seeking mukti). In the second half. He states what He, as the Saviour who has accepted the responsibility of protecting, will perform and comforts the man who has done what he ought to do (i.e.) performed prapatti.





Here from the first person singular, mokṣayiṣyāmi (I) will set Thee free). (from this) itself, the meaning 'l' is evident. So the use of the word aham (I) has the purpose of indicating. by virtue of its meaning, the power of accomplishing what is to others impossible, for this is essential for setting (one) free from all sins. Its purport is this:- "I that bound the offender with fetters and that am destitute of equals and superiors am now full of compassion as the result of a vyāja or pretext and am bent on granting him pardon. (When I am thus inclined) there is no one to prevent me. Nor is there any one else who is capable of making him attain freedom (from sins)". This idea is well-known from such passages as the following:--"Bhagavān Viṣṇu is the giver of mokṣa". "The jīvas have been bound with the bonds of karma by the Supreme Being for His līlā and they can be liberated from these bonds only by Him. No one else is capable of doing so." In this word aham (1), Bhagavān's natural compassion is the superior aiding force and the graciousness of the Lord which results from prapatti acts as a subordinate aiding force and His independence and omnipotence, which are irresistible, stand as the foremost and siree ageury to dispel all obstacles. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows.--. "His natural compassion makes Him so gracious as to overlook countless offences in consideration of some slight vyāja or pretext. This graciousness accompanied by compassion makes the Lord's independence and omnipotence operate for the removal of all hindrances that stand in the way of prapannas. 'Thus Iśvara, who has all the qualities essential for granting freedom from all sins, can act towards that end without requiring any aid. This is the purport of the aham or (I) and it amounts to saying " I myself (without the help of anybody else)".
