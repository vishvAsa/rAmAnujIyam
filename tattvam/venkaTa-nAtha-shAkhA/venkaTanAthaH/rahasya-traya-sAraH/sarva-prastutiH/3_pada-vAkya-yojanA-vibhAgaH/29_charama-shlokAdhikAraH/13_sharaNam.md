EL SIGNIFICADO DE LA PALABRA SARANAM EN CARAMA-ŚLOKA: página 576
</details>




The meanings that have (already) been given to the word ś'araṇam occurring in Dvayam (on p. ) should be borne in mind in regard to the word śaraṇam employed here in the carama-śloka. This prayer for refuge or upāya (saranam though taught to Arjuna, should be considered applicable to all and this is evident from the[^115] Svetāsvatara Upaniṣad and from Śrī Rāmānuja's words in the (Śaraṇāgati) Gadya: "O Thou that art the Saviour of all beings in the world ignoring the differences that may exist among those that seek Thee". Similarly in such passages as the following :- “Those Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those people who understand the meaning of its latter part declare that the Supreme Being, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the ever-existing dharma or upāya ", " The great and eminent Rishis say that Thou art the refuge and the Saviour of those that have sought Thy protection". "He is the "Yoga (upāya) and the one who leads those who know bhakti  yoga to their goal". and "Bhagavān whom the wise call the eternal means (upāya) and the goal of attainment" -- (in such passages ) also, since there is no limitation of meaning, it has to be understood that the Saviour is for all. The only requisite for seeking Him as the Saviour or Refuge is that the person should be destitute of any other refuge or protector.

[^115]: VI chapter, 18: Desirous of mukti I seek refuge of HIM who created Brahma before and taught him the Vedas.
