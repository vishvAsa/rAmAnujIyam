A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF THE CARAMA ŚLOKA:--  page622
</details>



*This is the sum and substance of the meaning of the śloka :



" Your knowledge is limited; your ability is insignificant; your life is short and you are also impatient of delay. Therefore do not go about seeking other upāyas which you cannot (fully) understand, which you cannot easily adopt and which can bear fruit only after much delay. Realise that I who am easy of access to all, who am the Saviour of all the worlds, and who am endowed with all the attributes essential for a Saviour, am the only upāya and perform the surrender of the responsibility of protecting your self to me with its five aṅgas. When you have adopted this upāya, you will have done what you ought to do, you will become my ward and be extremely dear to me. Supremely compassionate and gracious, independent and omnipotent, I will, myself, by my mere will and without any other aid, and for the fulfilment of iny own purposes, free you from the manifold, endless, and insurmountable groups of obstacles without leaving any trace of them. I will enable you to have enjoyments similar to mine own, since you will enjoy myself and all that belongs to me. I will find delight in making you render all forms of service in all places, at all times and in all circumstances — service which will be of the nature of the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment (of myself). You have absolutely no cause for grief."

This path (prapatti) has been disclosed (to us) byācāryas who resorted to that unique dharma (Siddhopāya) which can grant all (desired objects) and which is ever accompanied by Śrī and who (by so doing) became free from (all) grief.

Giving up those dharmas which have to be performed with extreme care, we were convinced that the true refuge for us is the feet of that Gopala which are fragrant with tulasi and we resorted to them at once. By the gracious and fascinating words of that Supreme Person, we have become free from ignorance so that the karma  which has been separated from us can never follow us.

There are some (ācāryas) who have understood the noble and charming śloka uttered by Hari which is like the gem koustubha taken out of the ocean of Vyasa's Veda (Mahābhārata). Its meaning finds confirmation in the ways of the world (or the smṛtis) and in the paths of the Vedas. On hearing the words of these (ācharyas) which are like steps in the staircase that leads to the mansion of mukti, great souls like Vaiśampāyana and Śounaka nod their heads (in approval and admiration).



Here ends the third part of Śrīmad Rahasyatrayasara called “ The Interpretation of the meaning of the three rahasyas or mysteries by a study of the grammatical construction of the words and sentences in them",
