Thereafter the words,  "Do not grieve” reveal the certainty of what has been stated before ".



There are some commentators) who hold that "Do not grieve" enjoins something to be avoided. (According to them ), if, after a man has performed prapatti, he grieved or fell into despair, he would be violating the injunction and the Saviour who is the upāya would become indifferent and leave him to look after himself. The man would thus become liable, in their opinion, to this disadvantage or risk. This view is opposed to their own commentary on the sins committed deliberately after prapatti and on the words " from all sins". It is also opposed to the texts in the śrutis and the smṛtis which declare that the Saviour will never forsake the man who has sought His protection. Therefore since all causes for grief or despair have disappeared in the case of the man who has adopted this upāya, it repeats that there is absolutely no cause for despair and aims at confirming the man's faith.

Many causes of sorrow (in the case of Arjuna) like those concerning the destruction of relatives have already been removed by appropriate and excellent teaching. Now the sorrow or despair caused by the thought that the dharma or rites enjoined (for mukti) are too difficult to perform, that the hindrances to mukti are insuperable and that the end in view can be attained only after protracted delay - it is this sorrow that is now dispelled.



(The Lord) intends to say: After I have taught you this upāya, which, without being too hard to adopt for the end desired by you, is also capable of annulling all hindrances that stand in the way and is not liable to cause any (undue) delay in the attainment of that aim -- after this has been taught to you, there is no room for despair due to such things is the difficulty of adopting an upāya. If you adopt this upāya, your welfare is my burden or responsibility and I shall myself be interested in looking after it. If I do not protect you, it will be a reproach to me. You are, as it were, muy property or wealth (to look after) and there is no reason why you should grieve".



The grief that is here put an end to is not the old sorrow caused (in Arjuna's mind) by the thought of killing (his) relatives. It is a different kind of grief that has to be consistent with the context. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows :- "The rich qualities  that distinguish the nature of the gods lead to mokṣa, the qualities that make for the nature of the Asuras are the causes that lead to bondage". When the two were thus distinguished, Arjuna was grieved at the thought of what he should do if he belonged to the class of Asuras. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who understood this, said to him :- "O Pandava! do not grieve. You are born to attain the rich qualities of the gods". Similarly here, when (Arjuna) is extremely desirous of attaining the supreme end, he grieves at the thought that the upāya taught so far has to be adopted for a long time, and is subject to many hindrances, while being extremely difficult of performance even for those who are very careful. At the thought of that upāya and of his own (want of) capacity for adopting it, he grieves, saying to himself "How can I succeed in adopting this upāya and secure the end in view?" To Arjuna who was in despair (at this thought), Śrī Kṛṣṇa shows another upāya which can be only performed in a single instant, which is without any obstacles, and which is (also) easy of performance. By doing so, He makes Arjuna care-free and certain in regard to the attainment of the desired end and then says, “ Do not grieve". So the words should certainly be understood as intended to dispel the despair due to such things as the difficulty of adopting the (former) upāya. (It is only this grief that is here put an end to and no other).



In this Bhagavadgītā, the Gītācārya, at first, imparts a knowledge of the difference between prakṛti (matter, the body) and the soul or self; then He describes karma  yoga and jñāna yoga which are indirect means leading to mokṣa; thereafter he teaches bhakti  yoga with its aṅgas, which has been enjoined as the direct means of attaining mokṣa and says:-- "Thus has been taught to you the jñāna which is the most secret of all secrets. Consider all these and then do what you desire to do". Though He perceived the dissatisfaction that passed over Arjuna's face at that instant, Śrī Kṛṣṇa did not at once favour him with instructions concerning the easier upāya, for it has been said: "The Lord of the world tests the minds of those who are weak of heart". Instead of declaring the final conclusion by saying: " This is the direct means of attaining mokṣa and is supremely good to you. Act in accordance with this." - instead of saying so, he says:-"Do whatever you wish to do," as if He were indifferent (and not interested in Arjuna's spiritual welfare) like one who tells a traveller, " This route leads to the land of the Vidarbhas and this other to the land of the Kosalas. (Take whichever you choose)". Śrī Kṛṣṇa makes others think that this is the cause of Arjuna's mental depression and enjoys the līlā of instructing him once again in the principal means of attaining mokṣa  viz., bhakti  yoga. He begins by stating : " I will teach you again this greatest secret of all ", and in two ślokas explains to him, conclusively and with deep earnestness, what it is, so that he may remember that it is just what has already been taught. On seeing that Arjuna's depression has become twice as great as before, the Supreme Ruler, who is (now) the Charioteer, feels that Arjuna is now in a state of fitness to receive instruction in regard to the means of attaining mokṣa (viz. prapatti) which is the supreme secret and is, at the same time, extremely easy of adoption. Without the least delay, even without prefacing that upāya with any praise, the Lord immediately teaches him to perform śaraṇāgati towards Himself. Thus acting as the Charioteer also to the chariot of Arjuna's mind, (i.e. to all his aspirations), the Lord dispels all his griefs. That the grief which is here put an end to is therefore different from the old grief (concerning the destruction of his relatives etc.) thus becomes clear after a careful consideration of the context (in which the words occur).



In the first half of this śloka, since (the Lord) says to the man who is destitute of all other upāyas, "Take refuge under me alone," the man who is incapable (of making any endeavour) surrenders the responsibility of his protection) into the hands of One who has the ability. Further the independent and omnipotent śeṣī, who is compassionate, accepts the responsibility. Therefore (in the first half of the śloka), the prapanna becomes free from all responsibility in regard to his own protection. And since the śeṣī, who is omnipotent and is ever truthful towards those who have sought His protection, has accepted the responsibility and is so gracious as to say .-"I will release you from all sins", there is absolutely no likelihood of any evils like hell ensuing in the future. Freedom from fear results from this śloka, as also freedom from all doubt, , because these are the glorious and true words of Śrī *[^f6] Raṅganātha Himself, who is ever truthful.

[^f6]::2.




Therefore, if one has been told about this special upāya and if one adopts it, one will have no grief or despair, at all, in connection with that upāya.



Here it may be asked :-- From the words “Do not grieve", it is evident that grief ( at one's being without upāyas) makes one competent for prapatti; how then could it be stated that fear is also one of the marks of competency for prapatti, as shown in the following śloka :-"I dread, O, best of gods, at the sight of this saṁsāra which fills me with fear, Save me, O Lord of the lotus eyes. I know of no other upāya than Thee ", and in the Tamil verse:-“ Embrace this red-hot iron pillar, O, sinner"; in dread at these words, I have come and sought Thy feet for protection.” To this question the answer is as follows:- Having realised that the end desired by him has not been so far attained, the man grieves; he is also afraid at the prospect, in future, of formidable obstacles to the end desired by him. Therefore ( he has both grief and fear) In the case of the aspirant to mukti, when either of the two viz., the annulment of what is undesirable and the attainment of what is desired is mentioned, the other also comes (to the mind). In the same way when either of the two marks of competency for prapatti, viz., grief and fear, is mentioned, the other is also taken for granted. In the man who is absolutely without upāyas (and is therefore fit for performing prapatti), these two, grief and fear, are excessive. Therefore by way of conclusion, this adhikārī who is overwhelmed with excessive grief is taught the upāya which is appropriate for him, and is thereby made free of all doubt, free from all responsibility (concerning his protection), free from all fear and thus delighted at heart. On this extreme fear, we have already stated as follows :- " The Lord has ???? - the Lord who said: - “ Thou that art afraid of saṁsāra, come and seek protection from me".



The prapanna who has done what he ought to do (i.e) prapatti, should (continue to) perform the rites and duties (ordained for his varṇa and āśrama) (nitya and naimittika), which are among the kaiṅkaryas done by the virtuous : such karma  as is described in the following śloka - " Do that karma which, when performed, does not yield any fruit and which, when omitted, will bring in evil.” This is evident from the passages which are found before and after this śloka and also in this very śloka, where it is said that the omission will cause evil. Therefore since the prapanna has no uncertainty concerning the attainment of the desired end, since he has nothing further to do for the sake of mokṣa, since what he has yet to perform is only the keeping of (the Lord's) commands for their own sake, and since, if offences should be committed (thereafter), they could easily be atoned for by repentance and the like as pointed out in another chapter -- there is no reason why he should not feel delighted at heart. Though this delight is mingled with disgust (nirveda) in the intelligent (prapanna) who is still connected with such unwholesome things as the body, yet the two may exist without any inconsistency as the disgust and the delight are due to different factors respectively.



The words "Do not grieve" are, themselves, an indication of the cancellation of all causes of grief; even that portion of the karma  which has already begun to operate (prarabdha) and which will cause grief will be cancelled and the man who is so impatient as not to be capable of existing even for a moment longer will attain mokṣa  at that very instant. As stated in the Tamil verse : "The Lord is one who, to those that seek His protection, grants Vaikuṇṭha at the time of their death”, we have to believe that all that unexpired part of the karma  which has already begun to operate (prārabdha) will be annulled and that mokṣa  will be at the death of this body. Therefore if, in this bodily existence itself, it be felt (by a man) that what remains of this life is an evil, it will also certainly be cancelled by the will of the omnipotent Lord whose grace has been secured by prapatti.



(In this connection it may be asked whether it is not a sin to desire to die immediately after performing prapatti). The answer is as follows:-)

प्रायश्चित्तविशेषेषु सर्वस्वारादिकेषु च ।  
नात्महिंसनदोषोऽस्ति तथार्तशरणागतौ ॥

In some forms of expiation for sins (prayascitta) and like. wise, in certain kinds of offering (made in the fire) like sarvasvāra karma , it is not considered a sin if the man gives up life (by casting the body down a precipice or in the fire), So also there is no impropriety in praying for instant death in the śaraṇāgati of the prapanna who cannot bear to continue in saṁsāra even for a moment (ārta). On the other hand, the prapanna who desires to live a long life (dripta) commits an offence, if he violates the rule in the śāstras which enjoins the protection of one's own life.



In the same way as yogis cast off their bodies in virtue of certain yogas practised by them, there is nothing to prevent the man who, while performing prapatti, longs to die immediately. It cannot be said that such casting off of the body is not permitted to those who are in Kali yuga, like entrance into holy waters for giving up one's life there. In fact the ārtaprapanna who prays for immediate death is one who saves his self sooner than all others.



Prapannas are spoken of as belonging to two classes ārtas and driptas on account of the difference in the intensity of the grief felt by them respectively, (It should not, therefore, be thought that the latter viz., the dripta has no grief. The dṛptaprapanna is one who grieves at the thought of another janma and believes that he will some day or other attain mokṣa and has the patience to wait until the end of this existence. The word dripta is here used not in (the usual) sense of one who has arrogance or pride, which is a quality opposed to the virtues of the soul and leads one to treat good men with disesteem. The word ārtaprapanna is used here to denote the man who, in this life, looks upon even Brahma's position of lordship as an obstacle to the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavān, who feels that his present association with the body is unbearable as with a raging fire, and who, therefore, cannot endure existence even for a single moment after the performance of prapatti. He is, therefore, like one who prays, " Be pleased  to make my body and my life-breath perish." He is not the ārta referred to in the Gitā (7.16) "ārto, jijñāsuh, arthārthī, etc.," where ārta means "one who prays for the recovery of his lost wealth or lordship "



There are some who are of opinion that, in Śrī Rāma’s words:. " Whether the man is an ārta (who cannot bear delay in the attainment of the desired end) or a dṛpta ( who has no such impatience), the man who seeks refuge should (always ) be protected", there is ativāda or exaggeration in that even the dripta who is proud or arrogant is stated to be worthy of protection. Whatever that may be, there is no room for dispute in regard to this passage where mokṣa  is promised to the man who grieves for the evils of saṁsāra but can bear to live till the end of this life and then attain mokṣa, for he is not one who is proud or arrogant.



The use of the future tense in mokṣayishyāmi (I will release you) is not inappropriate in the case of the ārta who prays for immediate release from the body, for the end desired is to come after the adoption of the upāya and the word is used at the time when the upāya is taught (i.e. before the adoption of the upāya),



• These classifications into ārtas and driptas arise on account of differences in the intensity of the Lord's grace which are due to the differences in the good deeds performed by them before.



Such statements as are made in the ślokas -- " The man who has performed prapatti after learning the truth experiences, in this life, the consequences of his prārabdha karma  alone (i.e.) that karma  which has begun to yield its fruit in this life, and there after attains mokṣa" - such statements do not apply to the ārta. (Śrī Rāmānuja) has described what the dṛptaprapanna should do after the performance of prapatti, in his Gadya, in the passages beginning with:-“ You will be free from all trace of suffering or hindrance caused by the body, the elements (earth, water, fire, etc.,) or the gods "and ending with "Be free from all uncertainty in regard to knowledge concerning me and the vision and the attainment  of myself".



The freedom from grief that is stated here (in the carama śloka) has no limiting factors. Therefore the causes of all forms of grief are stated here to be annulled for the man who has a knowledge of this upāya and adopts it. By the teaching given here, mere knowledge (of the upāya) may exist without its adoption, but it would be of no use at all as stated in the śloka. "The song does not regulate (the actions of) the man though he may sing it very often. Creatures behave in accordance with their past impressions (vāsana) like the bird [^f7] *Kulinga', which, though it utters the words mā sāhasam kuru, (Do not behave rashly), continues to behave rashly". So in this śloka, it is implied that annulment of grief would be the fruit of a combination of both knowledge and action.

[^f7]:




Therefore, here, all grief or despair that might arise in regard to the adoption of the upāya, whether before its adoption or after it, or in the middle of it - all this grief is here (said to be) annulled,



If it be asked how, the answer is as follows; Despair may arise in many forms ;- (1) in regard to one's competency for the upāya, (2) in regard to (the potency of) the upāya itself, (3) in regard to the things that the prapanna should do after prapatti, and so also (4) in regard to the end to be attained including the full and perfect service or kaiṅkarya to be rendered. (1) Among them, this dharma called śaraṇāgati, which is to be adopted, is not confined to any particular family (jāti) caste or āśrama. Provided there are the desire for attaining the end in view and faith in the upāya which is the means for that attainment and such things as knowledge of one's being destitute (of other upāyas), there is no reason why any one should despair at the thought that he may not be competent (to adopt the upāya).



(2) The (sādhya) upāya (prapatti) is capable of being performed or adopted in a single instant with all its accessories, it is easy of performance; it does not need to be repeated; it does not take long to bear fruit; its accessories are not difficult; it is capable of yielding the desired fruit just at the time when it is desired; therefore to the man who is destitute (of other upāyas ) and who is afraid of delay (in attaining the desired end), there is no reason for despair at all thinking that he may have to adopt other upāyas like bhakti , which have to be practised for a long time with all accessories thereof, which are difficult of performance even to those who are very careful and whose accessories are also equally difficult to accomplish and which yield the desired fruit only after a long time,



The Saviour who is propitiated by this easier upāya and who is to grant the desired end is easily accessible to all, inspires confidence, is supremely compassionate and is independent and omnipotent without subjection to any one else). Therefore there is no reason why one should despair at the thought of the Siddhopāya (the Lord).



(3) After the performance of this upāya, none of the good deeds that may be done by a man either by say of keeping the commands (of the Lord) or winning His approval is an auxiliary or aṅga for prapatti. Therefore even if, owing to adverse circumstances of place and time, !here are shortcomings in their performance, there is no reason for grief or despair at the thought that these shortcomings might adversely affect the accessories (for they are not its accessories ).



If, in dread of certain sins due to prārabdha karma  which render a man absolutely unfit for all karma  like a piece of burnt cloth, by causing a man to offend the great devotees (of God) deliberately, if, in such cases, the man desires at the time of the first prapatti that his actions after prapatti should be free from all such offence or if he performs a later prapatti for avoiding these offences - if he does these, there is no reason for grief.or sorrow at the thought that offences may happen to be committed in future. Even if, at the time of the first prapatti, one has not prayed for a later life free of all offence, in case offences are committed deliberately, the Saviour of those that have no (other) refuge who stated, "I will never forsake the man who comes to me in the guise of a friend" will create repentance in his mind, and induce him to perform expiation or prayascitta which (in this case) is a further prapatti. If the man is too stubborn to feel repentant, (the Lord) will cause sufferings by way of punishment and thus prevent him from committing further offences. Thus before the time when the attainment of the desired end is prayed for the expiation will be over, Therefore the prapanna need not feel grieved at the thought that great sufferings like those of hell would come to him as a result of deliberate offences committed by him which flash like lightning and disappear quickly.



(4) Since the ārtaprapanna will have the desired end at the very time of performning prapatti, there is no reason why he should feel grieved at the thought thar the body which resembles hell would continue, (for the body has been thus described):- " If a man is fond of his body constituted of flesh, blood, pus, foecal matter, urine, muscle, fat and bone -- then he should be fond also

of hell".



As for the dṛptaprapanna :



All rites or dharmas of renunciation such as karma yoga will never be in vain as stated in the śloka :-- "The beginning that has been made in this karma -yoga will never prove futile. There is no harm in its being left incomplete; even a fraction of it saves a man from the great fear of saṁsāra" " The foundation that is laid is, as it were, a foundation of stone and especially with regard to the man who has performed śaraṇāgati, it has been stated: "I will never forsake him. Further the dripta prapanna is certain of attaining what he desired, though it is delayed until the time specified by him. So the dripta prapanna has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that the good deed in the form of prapatti might be counteracted by certain evil deeds which might be thought capable of doing so, as has been said in the śloka “ A yajna ""performed by one loses its effect by untruthfulness, tapas perishes by arrogance, age becomes diminished by contemptuous talk of Brahmins and gifts of charity lose their virtue by their revelation.” since he has prayed for mokṣa at the end of this life, he has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that, owing to certain prarabdha karma  ( which has begun to yield its fruit), he might have to take another birth.



Since he is a prapanna for no other object (than mokṣa). all his sins which might act as obstacles will be absolved; therefore he hus no reason to grieve that the supreme end desired by him would suffer delay owing to such hindrances as the enjoyment of his mere disembodied self.



The Lord intends to say :- “You have become the recipient of my grace which can cancel the causes of all forms of grief. So if, hereafter, you should entertain grief or despair, it would be as foolish as when you had no grief or despair before performing prapatti, while being subject to punishment by me. This grief or despair is not in keeping with the peculiar potency of this upāya,

with my glory as Siddhopāya who has accepted the responsibility of protecting you and with your state as one who has done what he ought to do by the surrender of all responsibilities to me." In their last momentsācāryas teach their good disciples the purport given above of this last sentence,’ mā śucah’ "Do not grieve", which is the quintessence of the carama-śloka (the last śloka ),



Among the words of this śloka (caramaśloka) are expressed explicitly by the words themselves or suggested implicitly by their meaning, the following ideas concerning this upāya :(1) the person who is competent for it, the preliminary condition of being destitute (of all other upāyas), the needlessness, for it, of any auxiliary rites which are too difficult to perform, the inappropriateness of trying to perform actions which are beyond one's power, the futility of obstinately attempting to do what is impossible (for one) this upāya being such as will not tolerate (the adoption of any other upāya); (2) the Saviour who alone can be of use to the aspirant for mukti, the Saviour's being perfect and full in such qualities as accessibility and good nature; the Saviour being the teacher of what is most salutary (hita); the end of attainment (viz, the Lord) being Himself the means of attainment; His being capable of acting in all matters without being hindered (by any one) and without the aid of any one else ; His expecting a mere pretext (or vyāja) for protecting (one): His not requiring the intervention of any other upāya: His being capable of being propitiated without any other auxiliary rites: His being the Saviour who can grant whatever fruit is desired; His intolerance of the acceptance of any other protector; His being ever in the company of Śrī (or Lakṣmī); His capacity for being placed in the position of other upāyas; His readiness to accept the responsibility or burden (of protecting one); (3) the Sādhyopāya which is of the nature of the surrender of responsibility; its ancillaries; its being within the competency of every one; its requiring to be perforined only once; its being easy of performance; its capacity to bear fruit without delay its being potent enough to annul prarabdhakarma ; (4) the man who performs prapatti being a doer or agent subject to the Supreme Self; his being subject to the authority of the śastras; (5) The Saviour's supreme compassion; His being ever gracious; His independence and freedom from subservience to any one else ; His being irresistible; His not requiring any other aid, His waiting for a pretext (to protect the jīva); (6) the prapanna being one who has done what he onght to do; the absence, on his part, of any need to do anything else (than prapatti) in regard to the upāya adopted by him or the fruit expected from it; his being extremely dear to Bhagavān; (7) the many obstacles ( to mukti) past, present and future; and the varied nature of the different groups of obstacles, their being capable of annulment by the mere will of Iśvara, the time of this annulment being dependent on the will of the prapanna: the nature of the annulment of these obstacles; (8) the manifestation of one's real and essential nature (svarūpa), which is different from the mere enjoyment of one's dis-embodied self : the full and perfect enjoyment of Bhagavān ; service of all kinds; freedom from coming back (to saṁsāra); (9) the manifold causes of grief or despair before (the performance of prapatti), the freedom from such grief or despair after (its performance); freedom from all uncertainty, at all times of reflection; freedom from grief, freedom from fear, a peculiar delight, biding the time when the body will perish and the delight in the performance of service free froin offence; these are the principal ideas (suggested) along with other things required for them.
