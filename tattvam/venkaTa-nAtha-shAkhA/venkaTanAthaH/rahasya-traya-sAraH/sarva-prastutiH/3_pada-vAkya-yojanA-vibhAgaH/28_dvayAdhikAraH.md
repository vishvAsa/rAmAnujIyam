This mantra (Dvaya) which is used for performing śaranagati to the Lord of Padma ( Lakṣmī) is of the nature of the dawn coming after the dark night of saṁsāra; for having caused it to be heard by Bhagavān, a man is in the position of one who has done his duty; having repeated it frequently, he is in the position of one who has attained his goal.

The particular upāya (viz. prapatti) which was stated as being indicated directly and explicitly by the middle word of Tirumantra (namo) or by implication in its meaning and the goal of attainment ( puruṣārtha ) viz. service to the Lord which is indicated in the third word (Nārāyaṇāya) are shown clearly and distinctly in Dvaya. This mantra is revealed in kattavalli separately, in two parts (with other passages coming in between ) and is enjoined as fit to be meditated on with the two parts together. It is also explained in such treatises as Śrī Prasna Saṁhitā in pañcarātra with details about the number of syllables in it (the aumber of letters, sentences, their order etc ). Therefore it is a tantrika mantra based on the śruti. The statement of some that it is a sentence given by ancientācāryas means only this much: that it should be held in great esteem because it was taught by the ancient achüryas or that Bhagavān who is the Supremeācārya enjoined it in the Bhagavat Śāstra, (pañcarātra). Those who desire to know may find its rishi (its beejam etc.) as for the Mūlamantra and the like in accordance with such treatises as the Mantraśāstra and the Science of Grammar (vyākaraṇa).

THE REASON FOR ITS BEING CALLED DVAYA:

This mantra is called Dvaya (the Two) because it treats of two points, the upāya and the upeya (the means and the goal of attainment, which are implicit in two ślokas (of the Rāmāyaṇa ), Namely, "He ('Lakṣmaṇa) fell at the two feet of his brother and said in the presence of Sītā, "Thou shalt enjoy thyself with Sītā on the slopes of the mountains. Whether thou art awake or asleep, I (Lakṣmaṇa) will render every form of service to Thee" The man who is not for any other upāya or for any other end or object (in view) has full competence for the adoption of this mantra.

Some (ācāryas) say that this mantra is called Dvaya (The Two), because it indicates (1) the soliciting (varana) of a Saviour and (2) the surrender of the responsibility (bharasamarpaṇam), both in one The same is the reason for the word Dvaya being employed in respeet of such other mantras as "Śrīman Nārāyaṇa Swamin". To this mantra also, such things as the adoration of The guru which are prescribed in the following ślokas in regard to another mantra concerning prapatti are applicable : "After prostrating before the guru, this sacred mantra (literally: the king of mantras) should be learnt. The guru is, himself, the supreme Brahman; the guru is himself the great upāya; the guru is himself the great vidyā or form of meditation; the guru is himsell the sacred Siddhopāya, the guru is himself mokṣa, the guru is himself the great wealth of jñāna or koowledge and bhakti  because he initiates (one) into the mantra, the guru is most venerable. This mantra does not require any suitability or any auspicious position of the stars for its initiation nor any purity attainable from baths in holy waters. Nor does it require for its successful initiation any japam, homam, daily repetition and the like. First one should prostrate in full before the guru three times and touch his feet with one's head and receive the mantra like a poor man expecting a hidden treasure. Having thus received the mantra, one should seek refuge under me. By this mantra alone should ope surrender one's self to me. He who has done so becomes one who has done what one ought to do ".

It is learnt from the Śāstras (Kaṭhavalli and the like) that a single utterance of this mantra by a believer preceded by a knowledge of its meaning as a whole will secure salvation. The potency of this mantra as distinguished from that of other mantras has been described as follows (by Śrī Rāmānuja):- "In whatever manner you utter the Dvaya etc." It has been said:-- "The man by whom the name of Bhagavān is uttered even unconsciously is freed from all sins as a forest with a lion in it from animals that are afraid of lions ", and (so also), "The extent of potency that Thy name, O Hari, has in condoping sins exceeds even that of sins that can (ever) be committed by a man who eats dog's flesh (i. e, a chandāla,". If, in such passages, the potency of a mere utterance of the Lord's name is praised in very high terms, what is said in such treatises as the śruti about even a single utterance of this great mantra which reveals, in full, the Redeemer, the surrender of the self to Him and the fruit to be obtained there from can be easily realised by the force of pramāṇas. The reason of this potency may be understood from the pramāṇas and from tradition or sampradāya. It is not proper to argne about these subjects which are of the nature of mystic doctrines. We can only place faith in them on the strength of what is stated in the śastras. In such treatises as the Mahabhiirata. it is said: - "Arguments based on reason are of no avail in regard to divine and other mys teries. The man who desires his happiness should have implicit faith in them like one who is deaf and who is blind."

The self-surrender which is the purport of this mantra has been praised in such ślokas as the folluwing and in other contexts : "A man should surrender to Brahman his true and natural self free from all limiting conditions like avidyā. This is bhakti  yoga and the karma  yoga which is necessary for it. Other things are vain talk." Instead of Other things are vaio talk" there is

another reading of the śloka which would mean “This is (real) knowledge and what is to be acquired with the help of knowledge." Though this śloka has, for its purport, the surrender of the self, the surrender of the responsibility or burden of protection which is described here is contained within it. Other mantras which are mentioned in such treatises as Vyāsasmṛti and in Svetaśvatara Upaniṣad like, “A  man should remember that he is the body of the spotless and resplendent Viṣṇu and with an eager longing for Him, who is the object of attainment, and without any desire for other ends, (he) should surrender his self to Viṣṇu uttering the mantra "Tad Vishnoh" - None of those other mantras reveals the Redeemer, the act of seeking His protection and the fruit arising from it so clearly (as this Dvaya). Even in the Tirumantra these three are stated (only) with extreme conciseness. Therefore this Dvaya which reveals, in full, the object of attainment and the means of attainment is the most important of all mantras dealing with prapatti.

THE MEANING OF THIS MANTRA

The śaranāgati Gadya is a commentary on Dvaya :

(Śrī Rāmānuja) has in his Gadya (prose treatise) given the meaning of this mantra as known from śruti, smṛti, Itihāsas Purāṇas, Bhagavat Śāstra and the like and in accordance with the traditional order of interpretation of greatācāryas :-- It is as follows:-The purport of the word Śrīmat (in Dvaya) is explained in these words in the Gadya);-" (Lakṣmī) whose essential Nature (svarūpa) and whose form rūpa are such as can be held in esteem by Bhagavān and as are in conformity with the nature of) Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa ". In the words beginniog with "opposed to everything of the nature of blemish" (in the Gadya), (Śrī Rāmānuja) has described at length Bhagavān's essential nature (svarūpa), His form (rupa ), and His attributes and glories (vibhūtis). So the meaning of the word Nārāyaṇa has been commented upon (in them.) In the commentary on the word 'Nārāyaṇa', Lakṣmī who has been already stated in Śrīmat is once again made to appear in the midst of His glories (vibhūtis) in the word Śrīvallabha in the Gadya in order to explain her role as mediator (between the jīva and her Spouse). Then Śrī Rāmānuja takes for comment the words Śrīman Nārāyaṇa employed in the sentences treating of the goal and the means of attaining it. The person competent for prapatti indicated by the first person singular in the word prapadye (I seek Him for refuge) is explained in the words (in the Gadya) which mean "I seek the refuge of Thy two lotus feet" explain the words caraṇau (feet) and saranam (refuge) and so also the verb (in Dvaya). Later Śrī Rāmānuja indicates distinctly the word Dvaya which is commented upon.

It may be asked: "Why should (he) dwell at such length without specifying the word Draya either in the beginning or at the end, but only here?" The answer is as follows:- Here in regard to the upāya and the upeya or what is to be attained thereby, the most important is Nārāyaṇa with Śrī (Lakṣmī). Therefore the word Nārāyaṇa with its attribute Śrī which occurs in two places rip Dvaya) has been already commented upon. So in order to show that along with the Sādhyopāya (namely prapatti)) which is indicated by this mantra, the principal upāya and the principal object of attainment have been commented upon, the word Dvaya is here inserted (i.e.) to mean that the Dvaya has been, for the most part, explained. Then in the ślokas which begin with 'pitaran mataram" and in certaio sentences taken form Jitante, and Bhagavadgītā and other passages which express the same idea, Śrī Rāmānuja shows that the resulting meaning of the Dvaya is the adoption of the upāya (prapatti) without any other object and with no other upāya in one's view or power, and the form of prayer for pardon with the thought of the Saviour's nature preceding it. Thereafter following the order indicated by the meaning (and not by the actual order of words in the sentence), Śrī Rāmānuja explains the prayer in the word namas for the removal of (all) hindrances. After this, he explains the supreme aim of life which is indicated by the suffix of the dative (or fourth case) in the words which end in the fourth case (Narāyānāya), which includes such aims as superior bhakti  (parābhakti ) that precede the attainment of the supreme aim (the attainment of Bhagavān and His kaiṅkarya). Then he points out how Bhagavān is so full of compassion (as shown also in the second half of the Caramaśloka,) as to vouchsafe success both in regard to this life and in regard to what is to follow thereafter. (This he does) by the words stated to have been spoken by Bhagavān. Therefore all that is stated by (Rāmānuja) in the (Śaraṇāgati) Gadya is intended to be conveyed by the Dvaya. This is indicated also by the words in the Gadya) which mean “uttering the Dvaya in this manner with an understanding of its meaning etc".

The ācāryas of old have declared that the statement in such writings as the Gadya that superior bhakti ( para-bhakti ) and the like (li, e. parajñāna and parama bhaktı) have, for their result, kaiṅkarya describes what occurs in the state of mukti. Since what follows later in order namely, the direct vision of the Lord (para-jñāna) and the eager desire for the uninterrupted enjoyment of Bhagavān are preceded by the eager longing to do so, they are said to result from para-.bhakti .

At the time of departure from the body, the grace of the Lord who dwells in the heart (of the jīva) grants to those who have performed prapatti that spiritual ripeness which would enable them to have a vision of the Lord. When the seed of a plant is soaked in the oil of ankola (azhinjil), it produces sprouts, leaves, flowers, fruits and the like in a few instants. So also, in just a few instants, the grace of the Lord enables the self to attain that spiritual perfection which would inake possible parābhakti , parajñāna and paramabhakti . This state of perfection or ripeness which is referred to in the Gadya is as appropriate as what is taught in such treatises as the Sātvata concerning the special religious observances (vrata) for attaining mokṣa - for instance, that the minds of men rendered impure by stains caused by the wicked senses become pure at the time of their death, as a result of their residence in a place where there is a temple dedicated to Nārāyaṇa. Such (great souls) as Nammalvar, Nāthamuni and others enjoyed the Lord even before their death, owing to some special grace of the Supreme Being.

Nammalvar has, in the following passages and elsewhere, stated the meaning of Dvaya: - "Meditate  soon on the feet of Nārāyaṇa and His consort and acquire a new life" (here the words up to and acquire express the upāya stated in the first part of Dvaya and what follows indicates the meaning of the second part); “The man that has sought the feet of Bhagavān black as the raincloud and who has thereby attained new life" and "O Thou on whose chest abides Lakṣmī because she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant, etc".

THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION OF DVAYA:

The meaning of Śrīman:

The word Śrīman Nārāyaṇa which stands first in Dvaya refers to the Supreme Reality (paratattva) which is the refuge of every one. The determination of the person of the Supreme Reality is well known to be arrived at in the śrutis by reason of His being the Lord of Śrī and by the word 'Nārāyaṇa.' The word Śrīmat in the first part (of Dvaya) is to show that, when Nārāyaṇa becomes the Redeemer, He is with His attribute (Lakṣmī). Arulalapperumal Emberumanar states :- " Before understanding the sabstantive which has attributes, the attributes have to be understood. Therefore to understand Hari who has Lakṣmī for His attribute, the attribute, 'Lakṣmī', has (first) to be understood." That this (Lakṣmī) is an attribute both in the first part (of the Dvaya) and in the second has already been explained in the chapter Siddhopāya śodhana as also the principle that when the upāya has an attribute, there will be no duality of the upāya. (See page : ).

The meaning of Śrī:- In the Bhagavat śāstras (pañcarātra), the word Śrī has been etymologically interpreted in six ways: (1) srīyate (is resorted to); (2) srayate (resorts to); (3) srnoti (listens); (4) srāvayati (makes listen); (5) srniti (removes); (6) śrīnati (makes ripe). The other words that are required to make the meaning clear have to be understood from what is appropriate (in the context) and on the strength of pramāṇas. (1) & (2) Śrīyate and Srayate :- Among them when we take the word to mean that She (Lakṣmī) is resorted to by those who desire spiritual re-birth and that she resorts to the Supreme Ruler of all in order to give them spiritual rebirth, we may take the following śloka (for authority):- "When Thy beloved Lord is displeased with a man who has committed serious offences in order, like a father, to reform him, Thou, O mother, sayest to Him, " What is this? Is there any man in the world who has no faults?" and persuadest Him by suitable devices to accept the offender by making Him forget (vismārya) his offences. Therefore art Thou our mother." As stated in this śloka, she helps to mitigate the anger of the Supreme Ruler who wields the rod of punishment for the sake of promoting the welfare of the offender. Thus she sees to it that the Lord's natural compassion becomes the cause of the man's ( spiritual) rebirth. The word Śrī, in this interpretation, would describe her greatness as a mediator (who intercedes on behalf of the jīva) owing to her excessive love which is that of a mother. The word vismārya, which means 'by making him forget' has, for its purport, as in the word avignāta (in avijnāta sahasrāmśu), which literally means (not knowing), the removal of the thought of punishing entertained by the omniscient Iśvara. The same is the meaning of the word 'fascinated in the passage, "He who is fascinated by the "charms of Lakṣmī, the lotus-born etc" The word 'mediator (purushakara) means "another intelligent being who is sought as a means or upāya for securing the favour of an intelligent being who can satisfy the wants of one". This mediator or purushakāra' is the mediate (as distinguished from the direct) cause for the attainment of the (desired) fruit.

We have already pointed out in Nikṣeparakṣa, as an authority, that by (her) very nature, by the practice (of the wise), by what we see in worldly affairs and by the words of gurus, and so also by the śruti and smṛti, dependence on an interceding) mediator is established (as a rule to be followed). "By Her very nature" means "By her nature in which there is no admixture of the anger arising from mental strength characteristic of a father and in which love (as for a child) resulting from a motherly feelings becomes over-whelming." It is her nature (always) to say: "There is no one who does not commit an offence"; "Who will get angry, best of monkeys, with these Rākṣasis who are under the authority of a king and being servants, render service to him?" "I cannot endure (to see) the sufferings of these servants of Ravana and therefore I pardon their offences". Her being the Lord's favourite is also such that, if she should intercede (on our behalf), the Lord cannot refuse. Since her very nature is such, it cannot be said that, to secure her help, the intercession of some one else will be needed and so on ad infinitum. As (an instance of) the practice of the wise, it is well-known from the Purāṇas, that, when Brahma and others were afraid to approach the Lord on seeing His wrath against His enemy, Hiranya, which arose owing to His intense love for Prahlāda, they approached the Supreme Ruler, who was then in the form of Nrisimha, with Lakṣmī as their leader (mediator) and praised Him. (Instances) may be seen also in such contexts as the following:- " The renowned" Lakṣmaṇa thus spoke to Sītā and the noble-minded Rāma." "Lakṣmaṇa, the descendent of Raghu, seized the two feet of his brother, Śrī Rāma, and said these words, in the presence of Sītā." In worldly affairs, too, this may be seen in kings pardoning the servants of the zenana as a result of even slight propitiation though their offences are great. This idea is also the purport of the śloka:-"O Mother Lakṣmī ! We who find our sole delight in rendering service to Thee and have only that as our aim, approach the Lord, look at Him and delight in serving Him, here and elsewhere, with the idea that He is Thy Spouse, in the same way as the people of Mithila looked upon Śrī Rāma as the bridegroom and the beloved husband of Sītā". The words of gurus are such passages as that of Nammalvar who says :-"O Thou on whose chest abides Lakṣmī, who says she cannot endure separation from Thee even for an instant". Texts may also be seen in support of this in the śrutis which are in the form of Śrī Sūktas. The Smṛtis based on these are the words of Śaunaka and others -such as the following :- "The man who begs for the attainment of Bhagavān, who is the purport of all words, should, of necessity, seek the protection also of Lakṣmī. It is not enough to perform prapatti to the Lord alone". Since it is evident from many pramāṇas that Lakṣmī plays the role of a mediator interceding at the feet of the Lord, it is but proper to understand it (in this way) in this context. Thus she is resorted to as a mediator and as the attribute of Siddhopāya.

As stated in the following ślokas ;- "O Lakṣmī,  with a countenance as delightful as the moon! When we consider Bhagavān and Thee separately, (we see) that the essential nature (svarūpa) of Bhagavān and His being the Supreme Ruler over all are the outcome of the superiority resulting from His being associated with Thee. Therefore Thou art that aspect of His which declares Thy Lord as being such and such." "Thou art, O Lakṣmī, the property of Bhagavān solely by Thine own will. Though His greatness (and superiority) result from Thee, they are not dependent on any one else for the reason given above. A gem is precious because of its radiance; still it should not be considered as having no worth (in itself). Its natural value does not diminish and is not dependent on anything else ",-(as stated in these ślokas) she is attached to Bhagavān (the Siddhopāya) like rays to the sun and the like, contributing to His splendour.

When we take the etymological meaning to be that she is to be reverenced by all, while she (herself) reveres the Supreme Ruler over all, she is the lady entitled to the service of all (of us). She is herself of the nature of a śeṣa to the Lord as stated in: “ Thy beloved Spouse is Bhagavān who is called Puruṣottama" and in the śloka : "All things, those that move and those that do not move, are, O Goddess that rulest over Śrīraṅgam, for Thy līlā. The eternal sūris who are said to be constantly looking at the region of eternal enjoyment (bhoga) namely, Vaikuṇṭha, were appointed to be Thy servants. By Thy compassion alone are we among those who are protected. Thy śeṣī is Bhagavān; all the rest are subject to Thy grace". W'hen the (etymological) meaning of the word Śrī is taken to be as stated in the śloka : “The whole world depends on Lakṣmī for support" that all things depend upon Her for protection and that she is attached to all things, that aspect of the Lord of Śrī which is declared by such words as Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu and Vāsudeva ) is declared also of Viṣṇu's consort. The author on Śrī Bhāṣya, too, has said Bhagavatī Śrī in the same way as He says Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa in that context; (i. e.) he calls for Bhagavatī to show that She has the same distinction as Her Spouse.

(3) & (4) When the (etymological) meaning (of Śrī) is taken to be, 'She listens' (śṛṇoti) and She makes listen (śrāvayati) it would mean: "When we who have offended (against the Lord) pray to Her that she should persuade Him to be accessible to us on our approaching His feet for protection, she listens to the cry of suffering of those who have sought Her as a refuge and pleads (to the Lord) on our behalf god helps to mitigate our suffering. The words which (literally) state her activity (really) aim at stating Her role as a mediator. Having heard from Him these words : "Those who seek my two feet as their sole upāya or refuge - I myself take them, O, my beloved! out of saṁsāra", and also "Compassion is a supreme virtue", she would, when the proper occasion arises, say, like the female pigeon to the male pigeon in the śloka :-- "Listen, my beloved husband, with attention to what I am going to say for your good. He who has sought refuge under you should be protected even if it be at the cost of your life". It may also be considered to have the following meanings : Having heard from the Supreme Ruler that He is ever bent on the advancement of the world's welfare, she would offer her advice to be listened to even by her enemies as in the passage : " If you should desire to save your abode (viz. Lanka) and to avoid a horrible death, it would be in your interest to obtain the friendship ot Śrī Rāma, who is the best of men "..

(5) " When the etymological meaning (of Śrī) is taken to be that she removes all faults (śṝṇāti), it would mean that she removes all hindrances in the way of those who have adopted the upāya (namely prapatti), such as karma , and this idea is brought out in the following passages :- "In all siddhāntas (systems of religious thought) and in the Vedānta, it has been declared that when Bhagavān affords protection, He does it always with Lakṣmī, who is the very embodiment of compassion, by His side", and so also, "Lakṣmī who resides in the ever fragrant lotus destroys all the (past) karma  of jīvas".

(6) In the etymological interpretation, "She makes the world ripe by her qualities” (śṛṇātii), the root (Śrī) would mean that, by her attributes like compassion, she enables those who have sought her protection to become ripe enough to have the qualities necessary for rendering service to the Lord. This idea is brought out in the passage: "Having Thy grace and the grace of Thy Consort who abides in the lotus, I will sweep the floor of Thy temple". Bearing in mind all these excellences (of Lakṣmī) stated in all these interpretations, Aḷavandār wrote: " Thy name too is Śrī. How can we have the fitness to praise Thee?" Bhattar, too, had in mind her being unconditionally gracious and said :- " Bhagavān" is ever gracious because of His association with Thee. Thy graciousness is not due to any cause or condition. It exists of its own accord, for art Thou not Śrī ?" Among these meanings those that are appropriate to Bhagavān's being the upāya  should be borne in mind in regard to the first part (of Dvaya), while those that are appropriate to Bhagavān's being the object of attainment should be borne in mind in regard to the second part (of Dvaya ).

</details>

In the surrender of such as one's essential Nature (and the burden of protection etc.), the Master is well known, to those who see with the eye of the śrutis, as the upāya or means and as one to whom the surrender is made. He is also the upeya (the object of attainment).

Though the word Śrīman means in general 'one who is associated with Śrī, yet here, as a consequence of the pramāṇas (i.e.) Śruti which says (Lakṣmī is His Spouse) it means the husband or Sponse of Śrī.

The relationship which appears to be general really means, on the strength of the Śruti, the specific relationship (of being the spouse ). Since He is called the Spouse of Her who is resorted to for protection and who is (also ) the world's mother, His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility are both indicated (thereby). Though Śrī is included in the word (Nārā) (in Nārāyaṇa), she is taken here separately in order to show that there is a difference between her and other things (included in Nārā) (in that she has omnipresence and other such qualities). She is shown as an attribute (of the Lord) (in the word Śrīman) in order to bring out the idea of her existence solely for Her Spouse, in accordance with the pramāṇas (i. e. of Her own will and that of Her Lord ).

THE MEANING OF THE SUFFIX MATUP (IN ŚRĪMAN):

Though suftixes" like matup have (all) the following meanings :- 'excess' 'censure' praise' 'eternal connection superiority (over others)', 'association', and 'the statement of mere existence', yet here, by special usage, it indicates 'eternal connection' which is well-known from the pramāṇas. This eternal connection between Bhagavān and Śrī is indeed such that even when He assumed the form of a Brahmacharin (in Vāmanāvatāra), He is said to have concealed, with the deer-skin, His Spouse, abiding in His chest'.

The two objections that have been raised by some in this context are not sound: The first objection is that the suffix matup is not employed when, of two things that are put in grammatical apposition or co-ordination (sāmānīdhikaranya), one is inseparable from the other and cannot exist without the other. For instance, when we say “Brahman is Ānanda, Brahman and Ānanda (bliss ) are in grammatical apposition or co-ordination with each other. Since anandam or bliss is an inseparable attribute of Brahman, matup is not added to it as a suffix. But when we say, 'the man having a stick (dandi)', the suffix matup comes after danda (stick), because the stick can be separated from the man and can exist without the man. So the objector says that since the suffix occurs in Śrīman, Srī should be considered as separable from Nārāyaṇa ( as in Dandi) which is put in apposition with it.

The second objection is as follows:-“If Śrī is separable from Nārāyaṇa and can exist where He is not (as during Sītā's separation from Śrī Rāma) the two words Śrī and the word meaning Bhagavān should not be put jo apposition or co-ordination without the suffix, but we do find them in grammatical apposition or co-ordi pation when Śrī Kṛṣṇa says :-"Among women, I am the deity of fame, Śrī (Lakṣmī) and Vāk (Saraswati)" and also in the sentence :-"Bhagavān is“ Lakṣmī who abides in the lotus ".

These (two) objections are unsound for the following reasons - The existence of the suffix does not, by itself, determine whether there is inseparable connection or no. For example: By the principle enunciated in Brahma Sūtras 2 – 3-.29, " The jīva is called jñāna because the attribute jñāna or knowledge is an essential and distinctive quality of the jīva, in the same way as Brahman is called Ānanda (bliss), because Ānanda is an essential and distinctive quality of Brahman." Here there is inseparable connection between the jīva and jñāna and the two are put in apposition with each other, whereas usage such as the jīva is one having jñāna (Jñānavān) is also frequently found. That is, though there is inseparable connection between the jīva and jñāna, the suffix matup is attached to jñāna, as in dandi, where the connection is separable. It is clear from this that the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup does not, of itself, afford evidence about the separability or inseparability of connection[^98] .

[^98]: Śrīman, jñānavān, daṇḍi have also the suffix matup though in different variations).

When it is said, for instance, " The king himself is all the subjects", where there is no suffix matup after the word lokāh (subjects) in the appositional use, it cannot be stated that there is inseparable connection between the king and his subjects and that the latter cannot exist without him, for the meaning of the sentence is something entirely different (from separability or inseparability of connection). So the proper thing to do is to understand the nature of the connection with the help of other pramāṇas which bring it out clearly (and not merely by the existence or non-existence of the suffix matup).

"Here (in regard to Lakṣmī's inseparable connection with Bhagavān), since the pramāṇas declare eternal connection (between them), both in the state when they are sought as upāya and in the state when the fruit (of the adoption of the upāya) is enjoyed and since in this mantra (Dvaya), this idea of inseparable connection needs to be stressed, the matup indicates that the two stand inseparably connected, both in the first part of Dvaya and in the second part and this conclusion is arrived at on the strength of such pramāṇas as the following :- “ Lakṣmaṇa," the descendant of Raghu, seized the two feet of Śrī Rāma firmly and said these words in the presence of Sītā", and " You will enjoy your self in the company of Sitā on the slopes of the mountains and whether you are awake or asleep, I will render every form of service to you". (The first passage describes their inseparability in the state of upāya and the second in the state of the attainment of the fruit, namely, the rendering of service to them (kaiṅkarya). Nammalvar, too, realised in his mind this inseparability in the following passages :-- O, Thou, on whose chest resides Lakṣmī, whose home is the lotus, because she cannot endure separation from Thee for an instant !, " While Lakṣmī with her beautiful bracelets and Thou stand together, I see that the supreme end of existence is to enjoy Thee and render service to Thee like the eternal sūris and other selves" (the former describes the state of upāya and the latter the state of attainment) and so also in, "Here (where we adopt the means or upāya) and there (in Vaikuṇṭha) where we enjoy Bhagavān, there is no one other than Nārāyaṇa who is ever found in (intimate) connection with Lakṣmī". ((48) describes both the states). This realisation (of inseparable connection between Bhagavān and Śrī, is essential for seeking the Lord's protection without any misgivings or heSītātion and whenever we desire it,

THE MEANING OF THE WORD NĀRĀYAṇA AND

THE QUALITIES DISCLOSED IN IT ;

Even the intercession of the mediator which appears as a requisite is effective (only because of the relationship between Nārāyaṇa and the jīva and because of His qualities which are disclosed in the word Nārāyaṇa. (i.e. It is because Nārāyaṇa is intimately associated with the jīvas and has certain great qualities that Lakṣmī's intercession proves effective). This may be seen in the passage: " Bhagavān may even say:" "My devotees will never commit offences, Even if they offend, it is only for my glory ( to bring out my unique forgiveness" ).

It may be asked whether it is not enough to say Śrīman (and not Śrīman Nārāyaṇa) as the word Şrimān by itself has been declared to be one of the names of Bhagavān in the śloka :-- Śrīdharah: Srīkarah: Sreyah: Śrīman, Lokatrayasrayah and elsewhere. The answer is as follows: "The word Śrīman is here used as an adjective qualifying Nārāyaṇa, because the word Nārāyaṇa is required here (in Dvaya ) in the first part in order to enable us to bear in mind the special qualities (indicated by that word) which are adapted for His being the upāya and, in the second part, in order to show that Nārāyaṇa, the śeṣī, who has both kinds of vibhūti, is the object of attainment.

Though the word 'Nārāyaṇa' used here (in Dvaya) has, for its purport, all the qualities which were etymologically derived from the word in the chapter on the mūlamantra, yet, since in the first part (of Dvaya) the aim of the word 'Nārāyaṇa' is to show His beiog the refuge, the following are the principal among the qualities to be borne in mind : affection (like that of a cow for the calf), that of being the Swāmin or Master, good nature, easy accessibility, omniscience, omnipotence, irresistible will or purpose, supreme compassion, gratitude, firmness, perfection or fulness, supreme generosity and the like. These qualities have been briefly told in such passages as the following:- "O, Thou so that art full of matchless qualities, that ownest the three worlds, O, Thou, that art my Saviour and that dwellest on the mountain Tiruvengadam which is longed for by hosts of gods and rishis! (Saulabhya)".

Of these vātsālya or affection is the tenderness which accepts a man for protection ignoring his offences, as in the śloka : "I will never ignore one who comes to me like a friend, even if there be faults in him. This will not be censured by the good ". It is (a quality) needed for not avoiding Him on account of one's offences. Swamitva or the attribute of being the master is the special kind of association existing between Bhagavān and the jīva, which is disclosed in the praṇava and the like. This is necessary to inspire confidence that He will protect (us) for His owo glory. Sausīlya, or good nature, is shown in His intimate companionship with such people of low birth as huntsmen, monkeys and cow-herds in spite of His superiority to all beings. This (quality) is necessary for inspiring confidence which would not make one despair saying : " Where is He who is the Master of all and who is armed with the discus and where am I"? but which would encourage one to expect Him to render even such service as driving the chariot and conveying a message. Soulabhya or easy accessibility consists in 'His being within the range of the eyes of all men' even though He is beyond the reach of even such great yogis as Sanaka and Sanandana. This (qualiiy) is necessary in order that we may not give up the longing for Him owing to a notion that He is too difficult of approach. Omniscience consists in His seeing all things, as stated in such ślokas as the following: "There is nothing in any of the three worlds that is not known to Thee", and "I bow to Bhagavān who, by His very nature, sees all things at the same time". This is necessary for the thought that there is nothing unknown to Him among the good things to be given to those who have sought His protection and among the hindrances to be removed from them. Omnipotence consists in the ability to accomplish what cannot be accomplished (by others). This is necessary to give us the assurance that, though we are now in saṁsāra (or bondage of births and deaths ), He can make us enter the assembly of the eternal suuis, Satyasaṅkalpatva means that His will or purpose can never be thwarted even by Himself. This is necessary for the confidence that we shonld have that the words: “I will release you from all sins", will never prove futile. Supreme compassion is the desire to remove the suffering of others without any thought of one's own interests. This is necessary for the knowledge that He will pardon on some pretext (vyāja) even those who have committed innumerable offences, as in the ślokas : "I will never give up the man who seeks me in the manner of a friend, even though he has faults", and "Fetch him, O Sugrīva, best of monkeys, whether he be Vibhishana or even Ravana himself. I promise security to him". Gratitude consists in looking upon even trivial acts of kindness with the greatest regard, as if they were supreme deeds of helpfulness and never forgetting them. (lnstances of this) may be seen in such ślokas as the following: "Since Śrī Rāma is large-hearted, he does not remember even hundreds of offences committed by others against him. He delights (on the other hand) on even a single act of help :', and "That cry for help uttered aloud by Draupadi even from a distance calling me "Govinda!”-that cry is never away from my mind like a debt that has increased with the interest accumulated on it". This quality makes one say to oneself: “If He sees anything of worth done by me within the limits of my ability, He will never forsake ine". Firmness is the quality of persistence in protecting suppliants. This is necessary to inspire the faith that He will never forsake us, even though others who are very intimate with Him try to dissuade Him, as (when Śrī Rāma said):-"I will never give up the man who comes to me in the manner of a friend". Paripurnatvam (perfection or fullness) consists in (His) having all objects that are desired or desirable. This is necessary to make us endeavour to serve Him in the way that is within our limited power, with the knowledge that is what we offer to him (upahara), He will consider only the fervour of emotion or feeling and not measure its worth or value. This may be seen in the following words (of the Lord): "Though what is offered to me by my devotees is atornic, it appears very great to me owing to their love. What is offered to me by those wanting in devotion, however great it might be, never gives me delight". " Whatever is given to me with love, be it only such trivial things as a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even (mere) water, I eat it, because it is given with devotion by one who is devout”. Supreme generosity is the liberality in making gifts which makes a person feel that he has not done enough, even when he has given all that he possesses without any thought of the slightness of the endeavour on the part of the person benefited, the greatness of the benefit conferred or the unworthiness of the beneficiary. This is a quality which induces men like Dadhibhāṇḍa[^99] and others to ask with importunity for the great benefits of spiritual life even for those who are connected with them, Thus such qualities in the Redeemer as are useful for seeking His protection and the manner in which they are useful should be borne in mind.

[^99]: Dadhibhāṇḍa begged Śrī Kṛṣṇa for spiritual benefits not only for himself but for those related to him

In the state of practising the vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the śrutis), only certain qualities (of Brahman) pertaining to that vidyā are ineditated upon. Still in the state of enjoyment of the fruit of the meditation, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with all his qualities. In the case of the word occurring in the second part of Dvaya, though all qualities may be present, since the aim is to attain Nārāyaṇa with such qualities as are essential for our service to Him whicb arise from His essential nature and from His qualities, the most inportant qualities to be understood are His being the śeṣī and His being capable of affording (perfect) bliss.

In another chapter (in chapter 11 Parikara vibhāga), we have (already) stated that here (in the word Nārāyaṇa in the first part of Dvaya) the determination to do what is agreeable and the avoidance of what is adverse are indicated on account of the relationship (of master and servant) implied in it.

There are some (ācāryas) who take Śrīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau as a single compound word. There are others who take it as three separate words Śrīman!, Nārāyaṇa!, Caraṇau and supply the word tava (Thy) between Nārāyaṇa and caranau. In this interpretation, they have in mind such passages as “  Do not approach those who say these wordś. "O Thou with eyes like the lotus, O Vāsudeva, O Viṣṇu... ...be Thou my upāya".  May  Thou Thyself be my upāya!" and the Tamil verse: "O Thou on whose chest resides Lakṣmī who dwells in the lotus 'O Thou, my Redeemer, I seek Thy feet as my upāya having no other upāya and no other object of attainment", "O Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, my Master" and other such mantras and also Śaraṇāgati Gadya which is an elaboration of Dvaya. ' (In all these

instances Bhagavān is addressed in the vocative case and the prayer in the Gadya seeking His protection follows). So also the first part of Dvaya is interpreted thus :- 'O Thou with Lakṣmī for Thy Spouse, O Nārāyaṇa, I seek Thy feet for refuge,' (understanding the word Thy (tava)). Thus, whether we take it as a single compound word or as three separate words, there is no difference in the manner in which the attribute (adjective) Śrī and the substantive Nārāyaṇa stand in relation to each other in the first part of Dvaya and in the second.

THE MEANING OF CARAŅAU.

The word Caraṇau means not merely 'the two feet' but by implication, the divinely auspicious form (of the Lord), (which is not of matter or prakṛti). That the Lord of Śrī is the Supreme Deity superior to everyone else and that He is in association with an eternal form are most important among things that should be known. This may be seen from such passages as the following: “He who has the true knowledge that Bhagavān has an eternal form and so also, O Pauṣkara, that He is superior to everyone else-Him does Bhagavān approach”. Therefore in the word Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, we should bear in mind His being the Supreme Reality that is easily accessible and in the word Caraṇau, His having an eternal fom. Even by those who have no clear idea of the essential nature of the Divine Being (that He is jñāna and ānanda) and that He has the qualities mentioned before-even for them the object of meditation should be the divinely auspicious form which is constituted wholly of Śuddha sattva (and not matter), which, in those who have a knowledge of it, removes the contraction of knowledge (due to past karma ) and which suggests Him as the Supreme Reality and His easy accessibility. Owing to its being the principal (meditation ), (Śrī Rāmānuja ) speaks of the divinely auspicious form in the Gadya before stating the qualities. Though Tirumaṅgai Alwar had a true knowledge of the essential nature of the Divine Being, yet he spoke of himself as one who does not believe in the Supreme Reality (that is jñāna and ānanda ) like atheists who consider the body as the soul, because of his extreme devotion to the eternal form which is delightful even to Iśvara ( who is jñāna and ānanda ). This idea is expressed in the śloka: “ The divinely auspicious form of Bhagavān is more delightful and more wonderful to Him than His own essential Nature (which is jñāna and ānanda)".

The divinely auspicious form of the Supreme Ruler is pure and auspicious (subha ) and is a fit object of meditation (āśraya ) as declared in the following passages : - "May I see that holy countenance of Viṣṇu with eyes like lotus in the form which He has assumed of His own will and which, when remembered, removes the sins of men ! " " Śrī Rāma fascinates the eyes of men with the beauty (of his form) and their minds with such qualities as generosity." Those who are in the bondage of saṁsāra may be objects for meditation (āśraya) but there is no parity or auspiciousness in them. The essential nature ( svarūpa ) of Bhagavān is pure and auspicious but it cannot be an object of meditation.

The pure and essential form of the jīva (free from bondage ) cannot come back to saṁsāra, since it is without the qualities necessary for doing so; but by its nature, it has in it in the potentiality of being associated with such qualities. Therefore it has not the purity and auspiciousness which are opposed to anything that is of the nature of a blemish, nor can it be a fit object of medi tation. When a released soul (mukta) assumes a form, it can become an object of meditation as also eternal sūris (nityas) who have form, but neither of them has the purity and auspiciousness which can release the baddhas from saṁsāra. Therefore it is only the divinely auspicious form (of the Lord) which has purity and auspiciousness and the fitness of being an object of meditation, which are both necessary to the aspirant to mukti.

It is known that the ( divinely auspicious) form of the Master is of more importance (to the aspirant to mukti) than His essential nature svarūpa, because it is capable of being grasped easily both by the high (like Brahma) and by the low (like ordinary men ) and because it can produce (in those that contemplate it) bhakti  and južne.

In the sentence prescribing śaraṇāgati, namely, " Seek refuge under me alone", (caramaśloka) also, the Lord who had assumed

a form appeared as the place of refuge. From the śāstras, it is well known that this dividely auspicious form in the five states Para, Vyūha, Vibhava, Antaryāmī or Hārda and Arcā is pure and auspicious and suitable for meditation.

Here (in the Dvaya ) the feet of the Lord should be meditated on as the upāya, because they ure easier of being grasped by the mind for meditation and have such virtues as raising compassion (in Him ).

The servant resorts to the feet (of the Lord) because of their being extreinely appropriate for resort and because as stated in the saying: "It is not possible to withstand the seizure of the feet", they are capable of increasing the compassion of the Lord and also because they have in them the power of affording unique enjoyment as stated in the śloka : "How can a man who has his mind set on Thy lotus feet which are full of nectar ever desire anything else? Will the bee ever seek the worthless Ikṣuraka flower, while the lotus is there full of honey?" This idea is well-expressed in the following passages :- "I am a suppliant at Thy two feet which protect the gods and the asuras alike". "Those lotus feet of the Lord which can secure the state of bliss for me - there is no other thing than they, which, in any of my births, can contribute to my (spiritual) welfare." "My upāya" is in Thy Two feet”, "I give up, O Lord, all upāyas and also the desire to enjoy the self (in its freed state) and am a suppliant before Thy feet which once measured the universe", "He seized the two feet of his brother (Śrī Rāma) firmly", "O my child, I caught the two feet (of the Lord) whose soles are red, which are well-set and which are adorned with toes that are beantiful, tender and rosy (in colour) and bowed with my head, “I have sought” the feet as (my) refuge". "He who has sought as an upāya, (for protection) the two feet that destroy the sins of those who perform prapatti". and others. Those who followed this tradition (like Nammalvar and Aḷavandār) said also :-"I was firmly set under Thy feet (for protection )"; "I have no other upāya and no other object of attainment than Thee and aml a suppliant before Thy feet". (So also) those who were proficient in the sūtras (like Parāśara Bhatta ) said, " Hari has a form full of such qualities as fragrance and tenderness. The means that can secure Him for us are His two feet”.

In the word caraṇau ('The two feet) the word 'alone' is implicit in the meaning (i.e. the two feet alone) as in “seek refuge under Him alone by all possible means," "Satagopan who resorted to His feet alone as the upāya and as the object of attainment" and "The feet of our Lord who lies on the serpent (śeṣa) ---His feet are alone our upāya".

"It has been said, by some who are stupid (manda), that the use of the word caraṇau (the two feet - the dual of charana) is against the interpretation that Bhagavān with Śrī as His attri bute is intended (for in that case 'the four feet' should be the words). This is silly because this objection is refuted by the word Śrīmat which distinctly and explicitly states at the very beginning of the sentence " with His attribute Śrī". This indication of the attribute 'Śrī' is first heard in the sentence and cannot therefore be annulled by the dual form, namely, the two feet' (which comes later in the sentence). The reasoning which says that the plural form "many or four-feet" should have been used in that case will appear ridiculous to those who are acquainted with literature, for the dual forn is used, because the husband is the principal factor and his spouse is necessarily associated with him. When an emperor has a spouse, no one would dare to say that he has some one else (as a second ruler). So also, here, a serious staternent has been recklessly made without due reflection,

It may be asked:--“When the omnipotent Lord becomes the upāya, where is the need for this attribute viz. Śrī? If He needs her, it would follow that He is not omnipotent." The same objection conld be inade against the qualities (of Nārāyaṇa) and the form (vigraha) (of Nārāyaṇa) which are stated in the words Nārāyaṇa and caraṇau respectively. If it is maintained, in accordance with the pramāṇas, that the qualities and the form are His attributes and that as there is a special efficacy appropriate to them as such, the omnipotence (of the Lord) is not thereby annulled, then the same argument will hold good (in the case of Śrī also) becarise (Her being the upāya along with Bhagavān) has been stated by many authorities (pramaṇas) and because in the word Śrīmat, Śrī's being the attribute is natural owing to her relationship of being the Spouse.

If, in spite of all this, it is held merely (on the ground of the (dual) caraṇau (the two feet) that the association with Śrī is mere Upalakṣaṇa[^100] and does not signify that Śrī is also upāya, then the same thing would have to be said about His association with such things as qualities (and form). If it is held that since the word (caraṇau) is employed along with the word Nārāyaṇa stating that they are the upāya, the one who has the qualities and the form which are necessary for being the upāya is the upāya, the same thing can be said also (of Śrī) here. Such being the case, if it is held that in case Śrī is considered an attribute, it would be against (the Lord's) omnipotence, there would be the same irreconcilability with that onnipotence, in expectiog Śrī to be the mediator (interceding on behalf of the jīva),

[^100]: Upalakṣaṇa: a mere mark, token or sign to indicate Nārāyaṇa who is recognised by that mark. An Upalakṣaṇa is not an essential feature of the object in question,

It is said in Bhattar's Śrīgunaratna-kośam :- "Though qualities like youth are common to Thee and Bhagavān, you have divided between yourselves for the sake of enjoyment (certain qualities) -- such qualities as there should be in a man - namely, independence of all others, subjugation of enemies and firmness, in Bhagavān--and such qualities as there should be in a woman - namely, gentleness, existing only for the sake of the husband, compassion and patience, in Thee”. In accordance with that śloka, when the jīvas offend Iśvara who stands supreme in power with the characteristics of the masculine natnre, of the nature of the father and of the ruler exercising control and such others, Lakṣmī who has gentleness, affection and the like becomes the mediator interceding on their behalf. If it is said that this intercession as a mediator is subject to the independent will of the Lord, then it may be said without any contradiction by the pramāṇas that Iśvara's being the Śaraṇya or Protector with his attribute Śrī who participates in the performance of (Her husband's ) duties is also due to His independent will.

THE MEANING OF THE WORD ŚARAṆAM

"Here  in Dvayam, the word śaranam which has the meanings upāya, abode and protector denotes only upāya". Since in the above śloka, upāya has been pointed out as the special meaning here, it denotes upāya. .

By the very nature of bharanyāsa (the surrender of the burden or responsibility of protection ), the Protector or Saviour is here (in Dvaya ) placed in the position of other upāyas, in order that the prapanna may refrain from any effort on his own part.

It may be asked :- When the Supreme Ruler is the means or upāya for attaining the fruit of His worship or adoration performed in accordance with the respective ordinances of the śāstras in the case of every adhikarī or competent person, where is the need for His being specially called the upāya here? The answer is :-"It is merely to show that the nature of prapatti is such that Iśvara who is endowed with qualities like natural compassion is placed in it (prapatti) in the position of other upāyas.

If it be asked, “Since prapatti is adopted in the place of bhakti yoga , why should Iśvara be stated to be " In the place of other upāyas"? The answer is as follows:- “The fruit (of spiritual striving ) is to be attained by prapatti being adopted as an accessory means or aid and by upāsana or meditation or adoration (bhakti ) being adopted as the main or primary) upāya. When there is no upāsana (or bhakti ), that fruit has to be obtained by means of prapatti alone. This becomes possible only because Iśvara is naturally possessed of such qualities as compassion. That is why it is said that Iśvara stands in the case of the man destitute of upāyas, in the position of other upāyas. The man who is destitute of upāyas ordained for the attainment of the desired fruit and cannot bear the burden or responsibility (of adopting those upāyas ) places (Iśvara) who stands as the Protector in the position of other upāyas saying: "May Thou be my upāya!" It means  Instead of placing the burden of adopting other upāyas on my shoulders (literally, the head) may the granting of all the desired fruits which could be obtained by bearing that burden be solely Thy burden or responsibility, since Thou art capable and compassionate !" Separating this aspect (from others, viz., the accessories), nikṣepa or bharanyāsa is called the primary means or aṅgī (and not the accessory means). This includes the man's being without the responsibility for any effort on his own part. It is in view of this separation of bharasamarpanan (from its aṅgas or accessories, viz., the prayer that He should not expect one to do anything for oneself, that the word śaranam is used here only to denote upāya. (From this it would follow that the prapanna is care-free thereafter in regard to his protection.)

In some places the prayer to Iśvara to be the upāya and riikṣepa or bharanyāsa are spoken of separately ( as if they were different, though, in reality, they are not different). This should be understood as being due to one of three reasons: (1) The word upāya is (then) used to mean only the prayer for protection without including the prayer that Iśvara should be in the place of other upāyas which can be expected of the prapanna. (2) It may be to distinguish bharasamarpaṇam and the like distinctly and separately from the prayer for being the upāya or (3) Since the samarpanam or surrender is of three things viz., svarūpa (essential nature), bhara (responsibility for protection) and phala (or the fruit to be attained), every one of them has to be stated as different from the other two. Therefore none of these can be said to be redundant, (The prayer for Iśvara being the upāya refers to bhara; and the word nikṣepa refers to svarūpa).

This aspect of Iśvara being the upāya should be understood as the peculiar feature of Nyāsa vidyā. (Iśvara's) jñāna, power, and the like also appear in as much as they are required for this purpose.

THE MEANING OF THE WORD PRAPADYE:

Since verbs meaning 'to go' or 'to move' mean also to have a knowledge of' or 'to know, the root pad in the word prapadye, which means 'to go' means, here the specific knowledge required in this context. The knowledge, here, is the sure knowledge or faith that the Lord will save (us). Since faith which is the most important of the accessories or aṅgas (to prapatti) is referred to here, the Sādhyopāya with all its accessories is indicated here. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- The preposition pra (in prapadye) discloses the greatness or intensity of the faith which is its excellence. This excellence or intensity of faith would arise only when one bears in mind the mediatorship (of Lakṣmī) and one's relationship with the Lord, the Lord's qualities and the like (form) which are respectively present in the words (Śrīmat) and Nārāyaṇa. By this intensity of faith, all doubts arising from the greatness of one's offences will disappear. This intensity of faith is necessary as stated in the śloka : "The Rākṣasas had no confidence in (the effectiveness of) the Brahma missile (astra ) with which Hanuman was bound. The result was that that missile which would never fail of its purpose became loose immediately. In the same way, if men had no faith in the efficacy of prapatti, it would be the same as if it had not been performed at all. Therefore prapatti gives mokṣa soon to those who have faith in it". The potency of this certainty of belief is well known from the following passages :- "If a man has no faith, he can never approach that Supreme Brahman", and “Hari is ever present in all those who have no doubts. The Lord of Lakṣmī (Mādhava ) is never present in those who doubt as a r'esult of their reasoning or logic". If this intense faith is present, doubts will never arise during any inquiry into Bhagavān's qualities and the like). Therefore intensity of faith at the first moment (of performing prapatti) which would never permit of later doubts is an accessory or aṅga of prapatti. Even if it is weak, Iśvara who has begun to show His special grace will make it full and perfect". Has not the Saviour graciously stated: “I will never give up the man who has come to me in the guise of a friend, whatever might happen'? Is not His grace of such a nature as is described in the śloka, about such things as even anjali :- "If a man has folded his hands in worship to Thy feet at any time and in any manner, it will destroy all his sins at that very instant and lead to the attainment of good things. It will never prove futile". Therefore even weakness of faith will grow into deep and intense faith (in those who have performed prapatti with all its aṅgas).

- On this expression of intense faith stating, "I have made up my mind to beg Thee for being my upāya", the prayer (to Iśvara ) to be the upāya may be taken here as having been made and this would be in accordance with the following pramāṇas: " When what a man desires cannot be attained with the help of any one else, a prayer is made, with intense faith, to one who has the required ability (to secure the object desired) that he should be the means or upāya. This prayer is prapatti; it is śaranagati!'. "The thoughts of praying:--- "May Thou alone be my upāya!” this is śaraṇāgati. Let this be done towards Bhagavān", "Those who say to Hari: “Be Thou my upāya"- never approach them”. The aṅga or accessory called " seeking protectorship” is contained within this and is not separate or different from this.

It may be asked:--" What is the prayer in this first part of Dvaya for? Since in the second part, there is a prayer for the attainment of the desired end and the removal of hindrances there. to, the prayer here cannot be for the same as, in that case, there would be repetition or redundancy. When prapatti is adopted as an aṅga or accessory, the prayer might be said to be for bhakti  as an upāya; but here, since prapatti is adopted as a direct and independent means, there cannot be any upāya which can be acquired and for which a prayer could be made ( what, then, can this prayer be for?)". The answer to this question is as follows:- "The award of the desired fruit which finds a place (in the second part of Dvaya ) is common to all adhikārīs, whatever be the upāya (bhakti  or prapatti) that they adopt. Since prapatti is not an aṅga or accessory for any other upāya in the case of one who is destitute of any other upāya and who makes a surrender of every. thing (svarūpa - bhara . and phala), its superiority (to other upāyas ) consists in the Saviour Himself standing in the place of the upāya and granting the fruit or desired end. Therefore what is prayed for here is the point that Iśvara should accept the responsibility of protection (bharasvīkāra ). But it may be asked again :- " Will not this prayer that the Lord should stand as the upāya mean the same as a prayer that He should grant the desired fruit or object withont any other upāya being required as a further condition coming in between? In that case will not the prayer in the second part of Dvaya be redundant!" The answer to this question is as follows:- Since in the prayer of the above description (in the second part), what is required is stated separately because it is different in some points from the expectation in the prayer (in the first part), there is no redundancy; [(i.e.) in the prayer for Iśvara being the upāya, there is no expectation of any fruit except that He should be the upāya ; in the prayer in the second part there is expectation of the desired fruit] . It may also be explained thus: though the word signifying prayer (bhaveyam) has to be supplied in order to make the second part a complete sentence, in the first part praying for Iśvara becoming the upāya, the fruit is asked for, but in a general way, while, in the second part, the purport is to specify the nature of that fruit.

The sum and substance of the first and the second parts, when duly determined, will amount to saying this :- "I am destitute of all upāyas; therefore in order that Thou mayst stand in the place of these upãyas and grant me the specific end that is desired, I surrender the responsibility for the protection of myself as stated ( in the śāstras)". Thus it (the Dvaya) is a surrender of the responsibility (for protection) accompanied by a special prayer. This surrender, too, is the meaning of prapadye which indicates resolution (I resolve). We have (already) proved in many places with the help of pramāṇas and on the authority of traditional practice that the surrender of responsibility with all its accessories is the gist of the śāstras on prapatti (vide chapters 11 and 12 on Parikaravibhāga and Sāṅgaprapadana).

The primary importance of the nikṣepa (surrender) which is stated in another mantra for the performing of prapatti is the same here also, namely: "By this mantra alone should a man surrender himself to me. He who has thus surrendered what ought to be surrendered will become one who has done what he ought to do".

The first person singular in prapadye (I resolve) which shows one to be the doer, proves that the way to win the favour of Siddhopāya (Iśvara), who has the gift of mokṣa in His power, is some form of vyāja (bhakti  or prapatti) which can be accomplished by the aspirant to mukti in accordance with the śāstras.

In this (the first part of Dvaya) the specific adhikārī or competept person for the performance and the idea of helplessness (kārpaṇya), which is one of the accessories or aṅgas of prapatti, are also hinted at as in the following passages:-- I  who have no other upāya and no other Saviour" etc. "I am the "abode of all offences: I have no means or upāya for saving myself and have nothing else to attain than Thee." and "I have "not been firmly established in the performance of dharma (i.e. I have not performed karma  yoga ;) neither have I realised the essential nature ( svarūpa) of myself (i, e. I have not perfornued jñāna yoga : nor have I devotion to Thy lotus feet lie. I have not performed bhakti  yoga". This is elaborated by Śrī Rāmānuja in the Śaraṇāgati Gadya in the words, "Having no other refuge or Saviour" and in the little Gadya (Śrī Raṅga Gadya) in the churṇikā, which says, "My soul is eternally subject to Thy control and likewise in the cūrṇikā in Vaikuṇṭhagadya where he says, 'I realise that, in order to attain Him, I have no other means, even in thousands of crores of kalpas (1000 yugas), than seeking His two lotus feet". Arulalapperumal Emperumanar, too, has declared: "The man who, owing to his powerlessness, has not the required upāya or means for attaining Bhagavān which is the end desired by him that man should realise with faith that His feet are the upāya for securing his object" Since prapatti ordains, as an upāya, the surrender of the responsibility for protection (bharasamarpana) which is adapted to the adhikārī who is destitute of upāyas, it goes without saying (from the very logic of the matter) that it does not require the performance of any other action which is too hard (for him) to perform.

Thus in the word prapadye (I resolve to seek ) accompanied by the word saranam (refuge), four accessories may be considered as having been indicated: the faith that (the Lord) will protect, and so also seeking Him as the Saviour, the surrender of the self and (one's) helplessness (kārpaṇya). We have already stated that the word Nārāyaṇa with its adjective (Śrīmat) declares such things as Bhagavān's being the Master in accordance with such authoritative texts as the following:-"All beings, those that move and those that do not move, are the body of Bhagavān. Therefore I should do what is good for them". This determination is the sixth aṅga and "The fifth aṅga is the avoidance of what is displeasing to the Master." Therefore His being the Master suggests the determination to do what is agreeable (to Him ) and the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Him). In another chapter we have stated that these accessories, too, are to be thought of only once for the sake of the upāya (namely : prapatti). The use of the present tense in the verb (prapadye) is, like (the use of present tense in the verb occurring in) the mantra uttered while cutting kuśa grass, to indicate the time when the prapatti is performed. (It does not mean, as the present tense sometimes ineans, that it should be done always). The views ( held by some ) that the present tense (in prapadye) shows that the intention is to enjoin the continuous performance of prapatti until the end of the present body, that it enjoins the continuance of faith which is one of the accessories until the fruit is attained and that it shows also the need for the continuance of such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord) even after the performance of prapatti, as its accessories--thesc views are opposed to the pramāṇas which lay down (the rule) that this upāya (prapatti) with its accessories should be performed only once.

If they (viz. the accessories described above) continue (even after the performance of prapatti because of the excessive eagerness to attain the object and of their being enjoyable, it does not follow that this continuance is part and parcel of the upāya adopted in the first part (of Dvaya), Therefore the use of the present tense in this sentence (in Dvaya) which states the upāya does not refer to the continuance of uttering the Dvaya for the sake of the enjoyment arising from love which is expressed in Śrī Rāmānuja's Gadya (namely - uttering the Dvaya always with an understanding of its meaning), (The meaning is: as an upāya a single performance or utterance will do; but when ove finds it enjoyable, the Dvaya may be repeatedly uttered).

Thus the first part of Dvaya discloses the Lord's being the Saviour of all, the essential nature or svarūpa of śaraṇāgati, its accessories and the nature of the person qualified for its performance. From this it is evident also that the jīva has no other upāya.

THE SECOND PART OF DVAYA:

Śaraṇāgati which has been thus described (in the first part; is capable of securing all desired ends, for it has been stated :--

"Only so long as prapatti which can remove all sins has not been performed towards Thee, only so long will there be misery caused by the loss of wealth and the apxiety to regain it; only so long will there be the desire to win wealth, only so long will there be no realisation of the self being different from the body; only so long will there be the suffering of saṁsāra." Further the Saviour is supremely generous; “Is there any other who is so generous as He and who can grant whatever is desired ?" He stands ever ready with the determination to grant whatever is desired by the suppliants, for it has been said: "If we receive any thing from the Lord, He does not lose anything thereby. He will give us whatever we ask.” (Such being the case) the question arises: "What is the object or end for which prapatti should be performed?** The second part of Dvaya, (as if in answer to this question), prays for that object (end or fruit), which would be in keeping with the Saviour who is supremely generous, in keeping with this special upāya (prapatti) which can secure the favour of One who is superior to all others, and in keeping with one's own essential nature (svarūpa) which will find its sole delight only in being His śeṣa. As expressed in the passage: "The only end which I seek is that the Lord should take me as His servant for His own pleasure", the second part prays for this desired end (namely, service to the Lord ), including the removal of all hindrances to it. From this it also follows that the jīva should have no other interest or object.

In this context, the word Nārāyaṇa with the attribute qualifying it (viz. Śrīmat) discloses, primarily and in accordance with the pramāṇas, the Lord's being the Master and the like and so also the unsurpassed enjoyability of the Master who has countless qualities and the two vibhūtis (glories ) which make Him fit to be the object of attainment.

THE MEANING OF THE WORD ŚRĪMATE (IN THE

SECOND PART OF DVAYA):

Though Bhagavān who is thus endowed with the two vibhūtis (Līlā and Nitya) is the object of attainment, the word Śrīmate (with Śrī) is employed here to show that, for the offering of the havis of the self, the intended recipients, are both the Lord and His Spouse. They are (the two) to whom we are śeṣas and consequently (the two) to whom our service is due. Primarily they are (therefore) the objects of attainment. This idea is implicit also in the following and other passages :- " Bhagavān, the Lord of the world, is in the glorious world called Vaikuṇṭha with Lakṣmī"; " Bhagavān who is seated on the serpent Ādiśeṣa with his Spouse" "The Lord is seated with Lakṣmī who is (in every way) suited to Him." "At the sight of Thee and Thy consort with her shining bracelets standing together (as the Rulers of the world)” “Lakṣmī whose beauty fascinates even Thee ", etc.

Though the word Śrī used here has several meanings as stated in the following ślokas: " She dispels all blemishes; generates good qualities in those who are in the world; is attained by all at all times and has herself attained the Supreme Object of attainment (Bhagavān)" and "The Lord's Spouse who has aitained the Lord and is attained by others and who dispels all blemishes and listens to the cry of the distressed " -- (though the word has all these meanings) yet, here, it denotes the person who is entitled to (our) service as it is derived from the verbal root Śrī which means ‘Service'.

THE MEANING OF NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:

Though the word Śrīmate by itself denotes Bhagavān and His Spouse who are entitled to our service, yet the word Narayaṇa is employed here to indicate the full and perfect enjoyment (anubhava) of the association of a śeṣa to the śeṣī, and of His qualities and glories (vibhūtis ); for this enjoyment ( alone) will generate the kind of love which is essential for all forms of service. Here the dative (or fourth case) which means for Nāriyana (existing for Ilim) refers thereby to service, 'Existing for Him' is in itself an eternal fact (and need not be prayed for). Therefore what is to be prayed for here is service (to Them) preceded by full and perfect enjoyinent as stated in the following ślokas and elsewhere : “ Hereafter I should bear in mind the fact of my being His śeṣa and render service to Him: This is the meaning of namas." " Whether you are awake or asleep, I (Lakṣmuana ) will perform all kinds of service to You".

Since the jīva while performing saraṇagati (with this mantra) is praying to the Savionr for what he desires, a word like bhaveyam (may I be) has to be supplied: Śrimate Nārāyaṇāya bhaveyam (May I be for Nārāyaṇa !) Thus, at first, the attainment of the desired end (service to the Lord) is prayed for as being the more important; thereafter, by the word namas, the removal of all hindrances (to salvation and to service) is prayed for.

Giving up the idea of his salvation by himself or by others as impossible and giving up the idea of his existing either for himself or for others by the thought that lie exists (only) for the Lord and having become free from all sins by his aversion to all other objects of enjoyment than the Lord), the prapanna enjoys all his bliss as something which is accessory to the Lord's enjoyment.

THE MEANING OF THE WORD NAMAS --

Here, after the word namas, the verb has to be supplied so that it becomes na mama syām, which means, "Let me not be for myself." Or it may be looked upon as na mama kiñcit syāt meaning, 'Let there be (in me) no notion at all of the sense of 'mine' (mamakāra)', which would be a prayer for the removal of all hindrances or undesirable things, as it asks for the disappearance of the notion of mine' in regard to all objects. The objections raised and the answers given thereto in regard to the attainment of the desired end and the disappearance of all undesirable elements in the case of Tirumantra should be borne in mind here (also).

Though this word namas prays for the removal of all such hindrances as avidyā (ignorance), karma , the impressions and inclinations which have resulted therefrom (vāsanas), the ruchi or tastes and the association with prakṛti or matter, yet it is considered (by some āchāryas) that, in accordance with the śruti[^101] which gives the etymological interpretation of this word (namas), the purport or ain here (in the second part of Dvaya) is the removal, in the state of attaining full and perfect service in mukti, of the weeds of one's being the doer by one's own will and of one's being the doer for one's own purposes and, likewise, of one's being the enjoyer by one's own will and of being the enjoyer solely for oneself. This weed or wrong notion is likely to arise because, in regard to the enjoyment of the fruit elsewhere (in svarga), the thought is present that the fruit was won by one by one's own actions and is enjoyed by one for oneself. From this it would follow that the man performing prapatti understands that, in regard to the service in the state of mukti, there are no such wrong notions as one's being the doer and the enjoyer by one's owo will and for the sake of oneself-notions which are present in the state of enjoyment of other fruits (like those in svarga). Having understood this, the man performing prapatli makes his prayer in conformity with this knowledge.

[^101]: The Śruti says: Whatever actions may appear mine are the Lord's, not mine, They do not belong to me; they are the Lord's; I exist for the Lord and not for myself na mama ( not mine; not for me)

Arulalapperumal emperumanar commented on the word namas occurring here by the following śloka :--- " The wise say that namas means the state of being carefree without expecting any help (of being without any responsibility in regard to oneself) nairapekṣyam which results from the jīva's surrendering all his burdens to the Supreme Being." The nairapekṣyam referred to in that śloka is being carefree or having no expectation or requirements without the sense of responsibility in regard to one's salvation. From this freedom from responsibility, we should realise that either bharasamarpaṇam is suggested here, (since there cannot be the state of being carefree without it) or that the surrender of the bhara to the extent of one's being carefree is intended. If we take the latter part of Dvaya to be " Aham Śrīmate Narāyaṇāya" . (I am for Śrīman Nārāyaṇa ) and consider it to be the offering of the self along with the bhara or burden of protection, and that thereafter na mama declares one's having no connection with oneself, as, when an offering is made (to the gods), it is said “This is for Indra and not for me", if we take it in this forn, it will be extremely appropriate for this interpretation of the whole of Dvaya being a statement of bharasamarpana. In this interpretation the first part of Dvaya is about the file aṅgas or accessories, while the second part states the aṅgī, which is prapatti. When the offering or surrender is made saying: "I am for Nārāyaṇa' as in the śloka "I who realise that I am Thy śeṣa surrender myself here and now at Thy two lotus feet". --- (when this surrender is made), it would imply that the responsibility of one's protection and the fruit arising from one's protection are Nārāyaṇa's as stated in the following passages : "When the question arises to whom the surrender of the self is made for the sake of salvation or protection, the answer is given "To Viṣṇu", and "I am Thy  responsibility (bhara) (in regard to protection)". This namas discloses the severance of all connection between a man and his self and what belongs to him and also between himself and his protection and the fruit resulting from it.

The (fourth or ) dative case of Nārāyaṇa and the word namas have, each, its significance, in as much as they indicate respectively the declaration of one's connexion with the Supreme Being and the denial of one's connection with oneself. It may also be that namas denies such things as one's being a doer not subject to the will of the Supreme Being. Even if we take the simple and ordipary meaning of namas as namami (I bow to Nārāyaṇa," it would be in keeping with the meaning " I surrender" as the word namāmi l I bow) has been commented upon in Mantrarājapada stotra as meaning 'for the surrender of the self'.

Thus in the case of those who consider on the latter part of Duaya as indicating the surrender of the self, the special kind of fruit or end (namely kaiṅkarya) arises of itself (without the need for stating it), as it is in conformity with the surrender of the self and consistent with one's essential nature (svarūpa). In the caso of those who interpret on the latter part as indicating the fruit or object of attainment (namely, kaiṅkarya) as explained before, the idea of the surrender of the responsibility for protection should be considered as being present in the first part which treats of the upāya in the verb (prapadye) being taken along with the word saranam (upāya).

THE PURPORT OF DVAYA:

Thus, in Dvaya, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the meaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words), the following principal points as well as what is required for them stand revealed:- (Iśvara's ) association with the mediator (Lakṣmī), this (association) being eternal, Śrī being included in the upãya along (with Bhagavān), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular form of relationship between the jīva and Iśvara, (that of being the body and the soul respectively and that of being śeṣa and śeṣī), Iśvara having a divine and auspicions form, the śeṣa making his approach to the Lord, in this divine form, how (the divine and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the upāya; the manner of winning the Lord's grace, its accessories, the adhikārī competent for adopting the upāya; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute Śrī, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and vibhūtis (glories), how the Lord and Śrī are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the jīva's being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the jīva's being the enjoyer (in mokṣa) subject to the Lord's will and by way of his enjoyment being accessory to the Lord's enjoyment. And these are recalled in Dvaya along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the upāya which is siddha (viz. the Lord with Śrī), the upāya which is sadhya (viz. prapatti) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with Śrī) and the object of attainment which is sadhya (namely kaiṅkarya or service).

Thus in this gem of a mantra (Dvaya), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of Śrī), the special upāya (for attaining it), (namely prapatti) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) are taught as in the Sariraka śāstra (Brahma Sūtras) (i.e. in the order in which they are treated there). In Dvaya the order of words follows the order in which the upāya and its fruit occur (i.e.) the upāya is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the mantra (taught) in the Svetāśvatara (Upaniṣad) viz. “Desirous of mokṣa I seek Thy protection)," the important point is the adoption of the upāya preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an upāya and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tirumantra, the order of

meditation should be as stated above in regard to the upāya, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the upāya would follow.

The words of learned men such as "One shonld seek (the Lord's) protection with (the utterance) of Dvaya" and "The śaraṇāgati which is stated in Dvaya consists in the faith that to attain Nārāyaṇa with Śrī, His two lotus feet are the upāya" - (these words) also show that Dvaya reveals the adoption of the upāya.

THE SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:--

Although here (in Dvaya), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the namas - (although) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the upāya as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed):

The sum and substance of Dvaya is this:- "At the feet of Nārāyaṇa who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from Lakṣmī and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T'hem, I, who am destitute of upāyas, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five aṅgas or accessories at the feet of Nārāyaṇa, so that I may not have anything to do for such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.

1. This has been taught byācāryas who had full control over their minds as a result of their indifference to worldly objects, who had won over the Lord by (their) prapatti and who were overpowered solely by their compassion (to teach it to others).

2. This (mantra) is understood as consisting of eight words (if Śrīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau should be taken as three separate words ;) of six words (if that componnd word is taken as a single word); and as a single sentence with five words where the predicate is important[^102] .

[^102]: With five words: (1) Prapadye; (2) śaraṇam: (3) Srīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau (4) Śrīmate Nārāyaṇāya; (5) namah according to Sārāsvādinī.

3. This uniqne mantra (or this mantra consisting of a single sentence) called Dvaya has three members (sentences); it can help secure the fourth end of life (namely - mokṣa); it gives a clear idea of the five things that ought to be known; it explains the upāya with six aṅgas (prapatti); its potency or greatness is similar to that of the seven oceans; it explains the meaning of ashtakṣara, the mantra with eight letters, and it produces here (in this world?) in Śrīraṅga, in the minds of wise men[^103] (Like Śrī Rāmānuja the ninth rasa, namely, (Śānta or spiritual serenity).

We have thus explained how, by uttering, in combination, the two parts of Dvaya which are read separately in the śruti, one can seek, as refuge or upāya, the two feet of the Lord of Śrī who, out of compassion, is bent on helping us and who is prepared to pardon us; one can thus attain the Lord of the lotus.born Lakṣmī and in the region of bliss attain faultless service to the Lord) along with the full and perfect enjoyment of the Lord.

न वेदान्ताच्छास्त्रं न मधुमथनात्तत्त्वमधिकं  
न तद्भक्तात्तीर्थं न तदभिमतात्सात्त्विकपदम् ।  
न सत्वादारोग्यं न बुधभजनाद्बोधजनकं

There is no śāstra superior to Vedānta; there is no higher Truth or Reality than the slayer of Madhu (Nārāyaṇa); there is nothing more holy of resort than His devotees; there is no better dwelling place than those places that are agreeable to them; there is no better means of preserving health than the quality of sattva (or eating sātvic food); there is no other way of acquiring wisdom than devotion to the wise; there is no bliss greater than mokṣa ; similarly there is no better ineans of obtaining spiritual welfare (mokṣa) than the utterance of Dvaya.

इति कवितार्किकसिंहस्य सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्रस्य  
श्रीमद्वेङ्कटनाथस्य वेदान्ताचार्यस्य कृतिषु  
श्रीमद्रहस्यत्रयसारे  
द्वयाधिकारः अष्टाविंशः ॥  
श्रीमते निगमान्तमहादेशिकाय नमः ॥
