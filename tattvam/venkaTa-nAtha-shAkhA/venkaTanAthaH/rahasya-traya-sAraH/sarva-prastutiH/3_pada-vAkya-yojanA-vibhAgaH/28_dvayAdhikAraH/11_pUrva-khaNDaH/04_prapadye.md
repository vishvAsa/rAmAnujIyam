is well known from the above passages :- 

and “Hari is ever present in all those who have no doubts. The Lord of Lakṣmī (Mādhava ) is never present in those who doubt as a r'esult of their reasoning or logic". If this intense faith is present, doubts will never arise during any inquiry into Bhagavān's qualities and the like). Therefore intensity of faith at the first moment (of performing prapatti) which would never permit of later doubts is an accessory or aṅga of prapatti. Even if it is weak, Iśvara who has begun to show His special grace will make it full and perfect". Has not the Saviour graciously stated: “I will never give up the man who has come to me in the guise of a friend, whatever might happen'? Is not His grace of such a nature as is described in the śloka, about such things as even anjali :- "If a man has folded his hands in worship to Thy feet at any time and in any manner, it will destroy all his sins at that very instant and lead to the attainment of good things. It will never prove futile". Therefore even weakness of faith will grow into deep and intense faith (in those who have performed prapatti with all its aṅgas).

- On this expression of intense faith stating, "I have made up my mind to beg Thee for being my upāya", the prayer (to Iśvara ) to be the upāya may be taken here as having been made and this would be in accordance with the following pramāṇas: " When what a man desires cannot be attained with the help of any one else, a prayer is made, with intense faith, to one who has the required ability (to secure the object desired) that he should be the means or upāya. This prayer is prapatti; it is śaranagati!'. "The thoughts of praying:--- "May Thou alone be my upāya!” this is śaraṇāgati. Let this be done towards Bhagavān", "Those who say to Hari: “Be Thou my upāya"- never approach them”. The aṅga or accessory called " seeking protectorship” is contained within this and is not separate or different from this.

It may be asked:--" What is the prayer in this first part of Dvaya for? Since in the second part, there is a prayer for the attainment of the desired end and the removal of hindrances there. to, the prayer here cannot be for the same as, in that case, there would be repetition or redundancy. When prapatti is adopted as an aṅga or accessory, the prayer might be said to be for bhakti  as an upāya; but here, since prapatti is adopted as a direct and independent means, there cannot be any upāya which can be acquired and for which a prayer could be made ( what, then, can this prayer be for?)". The answer to this question is as follows:- "The award of the desired fruit which finds a place (in the second part of Dvaya ) is common to all adhikārīs, whatever be the upāya (bhakti  or prapatti) that they adopt. Since prapatti is not an aṅga or accessory for any other upāya in the case of one who is destitute of any other upāya and who makes a surrender of every. thing (svarūpa - bhara . and phala), its superiority (to other upāyas ) consists in the Saviour Himself standing in the place of the upāya and granting the fruit or desired end. Therefore what is prayed for here is the point that Iśvara should accept the responsibility of protection (bharasvīkāra ). But it may be asked again :- " Will not this prayer that the Lord should stand as the upāya mean the same as a prayer that He should grant the desired fruit or object withont any other upāya being required as a further condition coming in between? In that case will not the prayer in the second part of Dvaya be redundant!" The answer to this question is as follows:- Since in the prayer of the above description (in the second part), what is required is stated separately because it is different in some points from the expectation in the prayer (in the first part), there is no redundancy; [(i.e.) in the prayer for Iśvara being the upāya, there is no expectation of any fruit except that He should be the upāya ; in the prayer in the second part there is expectation of the desired fruit] . It may also be explained thus: though the word signifying prayer (bhaveyam) has to be supplied in order to make the second part a complete sentence, in the first part praying for Iśvara becoming the upāya, the fruit is asked for, but in a general way, while, in the second part, the purport is to specify the nature of that fruit.

The sum and substance of the first and the second parts, when duly determined, will amount to saying this :- "I am destitute of all upāyas; therefore in order that Thou mayst stand in the place of these upãyas and grant me the specific end that is desired, I surrender the responsibility for the protection of myself as stated ( in the śāstras)". Thus it (the Dvaya) is a surrender of the responsibility (for protection) accompanied by a special prayer. This surrender, too, is the meaning of prapadye which indicates resolution (I resolve). We have (already) proved in many places with the help of pramāṇas and on the authority of traditional practice that the surrender of responsibility with all its accessories is the gist of the śāstras on prapatti (vide chapters 11 and 12 on Parikaravibhāga and Sāṅgaprapadana).

The primary importance of the nikṣepa (surrender) which is stated in another mantra for the performing of prapatti is the same here also, namely: "By this mantra alone should a man surrender himself to me. He who has thus surrendered what ought to be surrendered will become one who has done what he ought to do".

The first person singular in prapadye (I resolve) which shows one to be the doer, proves that the way to win the favour of Siddhopāya (Iśvara), who has the gift of mokṣa in His power, is some form of vyāja (bhakti  or prapatti) which can be accomplished by the aspirant to mukti in accordance with the śāstras.

In this (the first part of Dvaya) the specific adhikārī or competept person for the performance and the idea of helplessness (kārpaṇya), which is one of the accessories or aṅgas of prapatti, are also hinted at as in the following passages:-- I  who have no other upāya and no other Saviour" etc. "I am the "abode of all offences: I have no means or upāya for saving myself and have nothing else to attain than Thee." and "I have "not been firmly established in the performance of dharma (i.e. I have not performed karma  yoga ;) neither have I realised the essential nature ( svarūpa) of myself (i, e. I have not perfornued jñāna yoga : nor have I devotion to Thy lotus feet lie. I have not performed bhakti  yoga". This is elaborated by Śrī Rāmānuja in the Śaraṇāgati Gadya in the words, "Having no other refuge or Saviour" and in the little Gadya (Śrī Raṅga Gadya) in the churṇikā, which says, "My soul is eternally subject to Thy control and likewise in the cūrṇikā in Vaikuṇṭhagadya where he says, 'I realise that, in order to attain Him, I have no other means, even in thousands of crores of kalpas (1000 yugas), than seeking His two lotus feet". Arulalapperumal Emperumanar, too, has declared: "The man who, owing to his powerlessness, has not the required upāya or means for attaining Bhagavān which is the end desired by him that man should realise with faith that His feet are the upāya for securing his object" Since prapatti ordains, as an upāya, the surrender of the responsibility for protection (bharasamarpana) which is adapted to the adhikārī who is destitute of upāyas, it goes without saying (from the very logic of the matter) that it does not require the performance of any other action which is too hard (for him) to perform.

Thus in the word prapadye (I resolve to seek ) accompanied by the word saranam (refuge), four accessories may be considered as having been indicated: the faith that (the Lord) will protect, and so also seeking Him as the Saviour, the surrender of the self and (one's) helplessness (kārpaṇya). We have already stated that the word Nārāyaṇa with its adjective (Śrīmat) declares such things as Bhagavān's being the Master in accordance with such authoritative texts as the following:-"All beings, those that move and those that do not move, are the body of Bhagavān. Therefore I should do what is good for them". This determination is the sixth aṅga and "The fifth aṅga is the avoidance of what is displeasing to the Master." Therefore His being the Master suggests the determination to do what is agreeable (to Him ) and the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Him). In another chapter we have stated that these accessories, too, are to be thought of only once for the sake of the upāya (namely : prapatti). The use of the present tense in the verb (prapadye) is, like (the use of present tense in the verb occurring in) the mantra uttered while cutting kuśa grass, to indicate the time when the prapatti is performed. (It does not mean, as the present tense sometimes ineans, that it should be done always). The views ( held by some ) that the present tense (in prapadye) shows that the intention is to enjoin the continuous performance of prapatti until the end of the present body, that it enjoins the continuance of faith which is one of the accessories until the fruit is attained and that it shows also the need for the continuance of such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (to the Lord) even after the performance of prapatti, as its accessories--thesc views are opposed to the pramāṇas which lay down (the rule) that this upāya (prapatti) with its accessories should be performed only once.

If they (viz. the accessories described above) continue (even after the performance of prapatti because of the excessive eagerness to attain the object and of their being enjoyable, it does not follow that this continuance is part and parcel of the upāya adopted in the first part (of Dvaya), Therefore the use of the present tense in this sentence (in Dvaya) which states the upāya does not refer to the continuance of uttering the Dvaya for the sake of the enjoyment arising from love which is expressed in Śrī Rāmānuja's Gadya (namely - uttering the Dvaya always with an understanding of its meaning), (The meaning is: as an upāya a single performance or utterance will do; but when ove finds it enjoyable, the Dvaya may be repeatedly uttered).

Thus the first part of Dvaya discloses the Lord's being the Saviour of all, the essential nature or svarūpa of śaraṇāgati, its accessories and the nature of the person qualified for its performance. From this it is evident also that the jīva has no other upāya.
