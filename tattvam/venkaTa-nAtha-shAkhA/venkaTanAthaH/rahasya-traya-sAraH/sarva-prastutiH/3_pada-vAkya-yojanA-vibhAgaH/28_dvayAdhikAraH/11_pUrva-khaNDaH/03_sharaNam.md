It may be asked :-  

> When the Supreme Ruler **is** the means or upāya  
for **attaining** the fruit of His worship or adoration  
**performed** in accordance with the respective ordinances of the śāstras  
in the case of every adhikarī or competent person,  
where is the need for His being specially called the upāya here? The answer is :-"It is merely to show that the nature of prapatti is such that Iśvara who is endowed with qualities like natural compassion is placed in it (prapatti) in the position of other upāyas.

If it be asked, “Since prapatti is adopted in the place of bhakti yoga , why should Iśvara be stated to be " In the place of other upāyas"? The answer is as follows:- “The fruit (of spiritual striving ) is to be attained by prapatti being adopted as an accessory means or aid and by upāsana or meditation or adoration (bhakti ) being adopted as the main or primary) upāya. When there is no upāsana (or bhakti ), that fruit has to be obtained by means of prapatti alone. This becomes possible only because Iśvara is naturally possessed of such qualities as compassion. That is why it is said that Iśvara stands in the case of the man destitute of upāyas, in the position of other upāyas. The man who is destitute of upāyas ordained for the attainment of the desired fruit and cannot bear the burden or responsibility (of adopting those upāyas ) places (Iśvara) who stands as the Protector in the position of other upāyas saying: "May Thou be my upāya!" It means  Instead of placing the burden of adopting other upāyas on my shoulders (literally, the head) may the granting of all the desired fruits which could be obtained by bearing that burden be solely Thy burden or responsibility, since Thou art capable and compassionate !" Separating this aspect (from others, viz., the accessories), nikṣepa or bharanyāsa is called the primary means or aṅgī (and not the accessory means). This includes the man's being without the responsibility for any effort on his own part. It is in view of this separation of bharasamarpanan (from its aṅgas or accessories, viz., the prayer that He should not expect one to do anything for oneself, that the word śaranam is used here only to denote upāya. (From this it would follow that the prapanna is care-free thereafter in regard to his protection.)

In some places the prayer to Iśvara to be the upāya and riikṣepa or bharanyāsa are spoken of separately ( as if they were different, though, in reality, they are not different). This should be understood as being due to one of three reasons: (1) The word upāya is (then) used to mean only the prayer for protection without including the prayer that Iśvara should be in the place of other upāyas which can be expected of the prapanna. (2) It may be to distinguish bharasamarpaṇam and the like distinctly and separately from the prayer for being the upāya or (3) Since the samarpanam or surrender is of three things viz., svarūpa (essential nature), bhara (responsibility for protection) and phala (or the fruit to be attained), every one of them has to be stated as different from the other two. Therefore none of these can be said to be redundant, (The prayer for Iśvara being the upāya refers to bhara; and the word nikṣepa refers to svarūpa).

This aspect of Iśvara being the upāya should be understood as the peculiar feature of Nyāsa vidyā. (Iśvara's) jñāna, power, and the like also appear in as much as they are required for this purpose.
