“Is there any other who is so generous as He and who can grant whatever is desired ?" He stands ever ready with the determination to grant whatever is desired by the suppliants, for it has been said: "If we receive any thing from the Lord, He does not lose anything thereby. He will give us whatever we ask.” (Such being the case) the question arises: "What is the object or end for which prapatti should be performed?** The second part of Dvaya, (as if in answer to this question), prays for that object (end or fruit), which would be in keeping with the Saviour who is supremely generous, in keeping with this special upāya (prapatti) which can secure the favour of One who is superior to all others, and in keeping with one's own essential nature (svarūpa) which will find its sole delight only in being His śeṣa. As expressed in the passage: "The only end which I seek is that the Lord should take me as His servant for His own pleasure", the second part prays for this desired end (namely, service to the Lord ), including the removal of all hindrances to it. From this it also follows that the jīva should have no other interest or object.

In this context, the word Nārāyaṇa with the attribute qualifying it (viz. Śrīmat) discloses, primarily and in accordance with the pramāṇas, the Lord's being the Master and the like and so also the unsurpassed enjoyability of the Master who has countless qualities and the two vibhūtis (glories ) which make Him fit to be the object of attainment.

## श्रीमते
THE MEANING OF THE WORD ŚRĪMATE (IN THE SECOND PART OF DVAYA):

Though Bhagavān who is thus endowed with the two vibhūtis (Līlā and Nitya) is the object of attainment, the word Śrīmate (with Śrī) is employed here to show that, for the offering of the havis of the self, the intended recipients, are both the Lord and His Spouse. They are (the two) to whom we are śeṣas and consequently (the two) to whom our service is due. Primarily they are (therefore) the objects of attainment. This idea is implicit also in the following and other passages :- " Bhagavān, the Lord of the world, is in the glorious world called Vaikuṇṭha with Lakṣmī"; " Bhagavān who is seated on the serpent Ādiśeṣa with his Spouse" "The Lord is seated with Lakṣmī who is (in every way) suited to Him." "At the sight of Thee and Thy consort with her shining bracelets standing together (as the Rulers of the world)” “Lakṣmī whose beauty fascinates even Thee ", etc.

Though the word Śrī used here has several meanings as stated in the following ślokas: " She dispels all blemishes; generates good qualities in those who are in the world; is attained by all at all times and has herself attained the Supreme Object of attainment (Bhagavān)" and "The Lord's Spouse who has aitained the Lord and is attained by others and who dispels all blemishes and listens to the cry of the distressed " -- (though the word has all these meanings) yet, here, it denotes the person who is entitled to (our) service as it is derived from the verbal root Śrī which means ‘Service'.

## नारायणाय
THE MEANING OF NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:

Though the word Śrīmate by itself denotes Bhagavān and His Spouse who are entitled to our service, yet the word Narayaṇa is employed here to indicate the full and perfect enjoyment (anubhava) of the association of a śeṣa to the śeṣī, and of His qualities and glories (vibhūtis ); for this enjoyment ( alone) will generate the kind of love which is essential for all forms of service. Here the dative (or fourth case) which means for Nāriyana (existing for Ilim) refers thereby to service, 'Existing for Him' is in itself an eternal fact (and need not be prayed for). Therefore what is to be prayed for here is service (to Them) preceded by full and perfect enjoyinent as stated in the following ślokas and elsewhere : “ Hereafter I should bear in mind the fact of my being His śeṣa and render service to Him: This is the meaning of namas." " Whether you are awake or asleep, I (Lakṣmuana ) will perform all kinds of service to You".

Since the jīva while performing saraṇagati (with this mantra) is praying to the Savionr for what he desires, a word like bhaveyam (may I be) has to be supplied: Śrimate Nārāyaṇāya bhaveyam (May I be for Nārāyaṇa !) Thus, at first, the attainment of the desired end (service to the Lord) is prayed for as being the more important; thereafter, by the word namas, the removal of all hindrances (to salvation and to service) is prayed for.

Giving up the idea of his salvation by himself or by others as impossible and giving up the idea of his existing either for himself or for others by the thought that lie exists (only) for the Lord and having become free from all sins by his aversion to all other objects of enjoyment than the Lord), the prapanna enjoys all his bliss as something which is accessory to the Lord's enjoyment.

## नमः
THE MEANING OF THE WORD NAMAS --

Here, after the word namas, the verb has to be supplied so that it becomes na mama syām, which means, "Let me not be for myself." Or it may be looked upon as na mama kiñcit syāt meaning, 'Let there be (in me) no notion at all of the sense of 'mine' (mamakāra)', which would be a prayer for the removal of all hindrances or undesirable things, as it asks for the disappearance of the notion of mine' in regard to all objects. The objections raised and the answers given thereto in regard to the attainment of the desired end and the disappearance of all undesirable elements in the case of Tirumantra should be borne in mind here (also).

Though this word namas prays for the removal of all such hindrances as avidyā (ignorance), karma , the impressions and inclinations which have resulted therefrom (vāsanas), the ruchi or tastes and the association with prakṛti or matter, yet it is considered (by some āchāryas) that, in accordance with the śruti[^101] which gives the etymological interpretation of this word (namas), the purport or ain here (in the second part of Dvaya) is the removal, in the state of attaining full and perfect service in mukti, of the weeds of one's being the doer by one's own will and of one's being the doer for one's own purposes and, likewise, of one's being the enjoyer by one's own will and of being the enjoyer solely for oneself. This weed or wrong notion is likely to arise because, in regard to the enjoyment of the fruit elsewhere (in svarga), the thought is present that the fruit was won by one by one's own actions and is enjoyed by one for oneself. From this it would follow that the man performing prapatti understands that, in regard to the service in the state of mukti, there are no such wrong notions as one's being the doer and the enjoyer by one's owo will and for the sake of oneself-notions which are present in the state of enjoyment of other fruits (like those in svarga). Having understood this, the man performing prapatli makes his prayer in conformity with this knowledge.

[^101]: The Śruti says: Whatever actions may appear mine are the Lord's, not mine, They do not belong to me; they are the Lord's; I exist for the Lord and not for myself na mama ( not mine; not for me)

Arulalapperumal emperumanar commented on the word namas occurring here by the following śloka :--- " The wise say that namas means the state of being carefree without expecting any help (of being without any responsibility in regard to oneself) nairapekṣyam which results from the jīva's surrendering all his burdens to the Supreme Being." The nairapekṣyam referred to in that śloka is being carefree or having no expectation or requirements without the sense of responsibility in regard to one's salvation. From this freedom from responsibility, we should realise that either bharasamarpaṇam is suggested here, (since there cannot be the state of being carefree without it) or that the surrender of the bhara to the extent of one's being carefree is intended. If we take the latter part of Dvaya to be " Aham Śrīmate Narāyaṇāya" . (I am for Śrīman Nārāyaṇa ) and consider it to be the offering of the self along with the bhara or burden of protection, and that thereafter na mama declares one's having no connection with oneself, as, when an offering is made (to the gods), it is said “This is for Indra and not for me", if we take it in this forn, it will be extremely appropriate for this interpretation of the whole of Dvaya being a statement of bharasamarpana. In this interpretation the first part of Dvaya is about the file aṅgas or accessories, while the second part states the aṅgī, which is prapatti. When the offering or surrender is made saying: "I am for Nārāyaṇa' as in the śloka "I who realise that I am Thy śeṣa surrender myself here and now at Thy two lotus feet". --- (when this surrender is made), it would imply that the responsibility of one's protection and the fruit arising from one's protection are Nārāyaṇa's as stated in the following passages : "When the question arises to whom the surrender of the self is made for the sake of salvation or protection, the answer is given "To Viṣṇu", and "I am Thy  responsibility (bhara) (in regard to protection)". This namas discloses the severance of all connection between a man and his self and what belongs to him and also between himself and his protection and the fruit resulting from it.

The (fourth or ) dative case of Nārāyaṇa and the word namas have, each, its significance, in as much as they indicate respectively the declaration of one's connexion with the Supreme Being and the denial of one's connection with oneself. It may also be that namas denies such things as one's being a doer not subject to the will of the Supreme Being. Even if we take the simple and ordipary meaning of namas as namami (I bow to Nārāyaṇa," it would be in keeping with the meaning " I surrender" as the word namāmi l I bow) has been commented upon in Mantrarājapada stotra as meaning 'for the surrender of the self'.

Thus in the case of those who consider on the latter part of Duaya as indicating the surrender of the self, the special kind of fruit or end (namely kaiṅkarya) arises of itself (without the need for stating it), as it is in conformity with the surrender of the self and consistent with one's essential nature (svarūpa). In the caso of those who interpret on the latter part as indicating the fruit or object of attainment (namely, kaiṅkarya) as explained before, the idea of the surrender of the responsibility for protection should be considered as being present in the first part which treats of the upāya in the verb (prapadye) being taken along with the word saranam (upāya).

THE PURPORT OF DVAYA:

Thus, in Dvaya, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the meaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words), the following principal points as well as what is required for them stand revealed:- (Iśvara's ) association with the mediator (Lakṣmī), this (association) being eternal, Śrī being included in the upãya along (with Bhagavān), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular form of relationship between the jīva and Iśvara, (that of being the body and the soul respectively and that of being śeṣa and śeṣī), Iśvara having a divine and auspicions form, the śeṣa making his approach to the Lord, in this divine form, how (the divine and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the upāya; the manner of winning the Lord's grace, its accessories, the adhikārī competent for adopting the upāya; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute Śrī, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and vibhūtis (glories), how the Lord and Śrī are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the jīva's being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the jīva's being the enjoyer (in mokṣa) subject to the Lord's will and by way of his enjoyment being accessory to the Lord's enjoyment. And these are recalled in Dvaya along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the upāya which is siddha (viz. the Lord with Śrī), the upāya which is sadhya (viz. prapatti) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with Śrī) and the object of attainment which is sadhya (namely kaiṅkarya or service).

Thus in this gem of a mantra (Dvaya), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of Śrī), the special upāya (for attaining it), (namely prapatti) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) are taught as in the Sariraka śāstra (Brahma Sūtras) (i.e. in the order in which they are treated there). In Dvaya the order of words follows the order in which the upāya and its fruit occur (i.e.) the upāya is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the mantra (taught) in the Svetāśvatara (Upaniṣad) viz. “Desirous of mokṣa I seek Thy protection)," the important point is the adoption of the upāya preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an upāya and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tirumantra, the order of

meditation should be as stated above in regard to the upāya, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the upāya would follow.

The words of learned men such as "One shonld seek (the Lord's) protection with (the utterance) of Dvaya" and "The śaraṇāgati which is stated in Dvaya consists in the faith that to attain Nārāyaṇa with Śrī, His two lotus feet are the upāya" - (these words) also show that Dvaya reveals the adoption of the upāya.

THE SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:--

Although here (in Dvaya), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the namas - (although) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the upāya as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed):

The sum and substance of Dvaya is this:- "At the feet of Nārāyaṇa who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from Lakṣmī and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T'hem, I, who am destitute of upāyas, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five aṅgas or accessories at the feet of Nārāyaṇa, so that I may not have anything to do for such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.

1. This has been taught byācāryas who had full control over their minds as a result of their indifference to worldly objects, who had won over the Lord by (their) prapatti and who were overpowered solely by their compassion (to teach it to others).

2. This (mantra) is understood as consisting of eight words (if Śrīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau should be taken as three separate words ;) of six words (if that componnd word is taken as a single word); and as a single sentence with five words where the predicate is important[^102] .

[^102]: With five words: (1) Prapadye; (2) śaraṇam: (3) Srīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau (4) Śrīmate Nārāyaṇāya; (5) namah according to Sārāsvādinī.

3. This uniqne mantra (or this mantra consisting of a single sentence) called Dvaya has three members (sentences); it can help secure the fourth end of life (namely - mokṣa); it gives a clear idea of the five things that ought to be known; it explains the upāya with six aṅgas (prapatti); its potency or greatness is similar to that of the seven oceans; it explains the meaning of ashtakṣara, the mantra with eight letters, and it produces here (in this world?) in Śrīraṅga, in the minds of wise men[^103] (Like Śrī Rāmānuja the ninth rasa, namely, (Śānta or spiritual serenity).

[^103]: There is a reference here to Sri Rāmanuja's gadya.

We have thus explained how, by uttering, in combination, the two parts of Dvaya which are read separately in the śruti, one can seek, as refuge or upāya, the two feet of the Lord of Śrī who, out of compassion, is bent on helping us and who is prepared to pardon us; one can thus attain the Lord of the lotus.born Lakṣmī and in the region of bliss attain faultless service to the Lord) along with the full and perfect enjoyment of the Lord.

There is no śāstra superior to Vedānta; there is no higher Truth or Reality than the slayer of Madhu (Nārāyaṇa); there is nothing more holy of resort than His devotees; there is no better dwelling place than those places that are agreeable to them; there is no better means of preserving health than the quality of sattva (or eating sātvic food); there is no other way of acquiring wisdom than devotion to the wise; there is no bliss greater than mokṣa ; similarly there is no better ineans of obtaining spiritual welfare (mokṣa) than the utterance of Dvaya.
