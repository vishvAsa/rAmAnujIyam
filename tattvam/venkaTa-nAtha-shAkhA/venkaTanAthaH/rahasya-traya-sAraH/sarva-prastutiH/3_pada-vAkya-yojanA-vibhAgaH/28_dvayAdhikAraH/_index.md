Thus, in Dvaya, in the different words, by the nature of the Words actually used and of the meaning which is implicit (without being actually stated in words), the following principal points as well as what is required for them stand revealed:- (Iśvara's ) association with the mediator (Lakṣmī), this (association) being eternal, Śrī being included in the upãya along (with Bhagavān), the Saviour being full and perfect in His qualities, the particular form of relationship between the jīva and Iśvara, (that of being the body and the soul respectively and that of being śeṣa and śeṣī), Iśvara having a divine and auspicions form, the śeṣa making his approach to the Lord, in this divine form, how (the divine and auspicious form of the Lord) becomes the upāya; the manner of winning the Lord's grace, its accessories, the adhikārī competent for adopting the upāya; how the end to be attained is the Lord with His attribute Śrī, how the object of attainment (the Lord) is endowed with qualities and vibhūtis (glories), how the Lord and Śrī are the recipients entitled to (our) service, the prayer for perforniing this service, the attainment of all forms of service, the removal of all that is undesirable, their utter and complete removal, the jīva's being the doer subject to the will of the Supreme Being and for His purposes, the jīva's being the enjoyer (in mokṣa) subject to the Lord's will and by way of his enjoyment being accessory to the Lord's enjoyment. And these are recalled in Dvaya along with two principal things which are intended to be stated, namely, (1) the upāya which is siddha (viz. the Lord with Śrī), the upāya which is sadhya (viz. prapatti) and (2) the object of attainment which is siddha (namely, the Lord with Śrī) and the object of attainment which is sadhya (namely kaiṅkarya or service).

Thus in this gem of a mantra (Dvaya), the Supreme Reality (the Lord of Śrī), the special upāya (for attaining it), (namely prapatti) and the desired end or fruit (namely-enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) are taught as in the Sariraka śāstra (Brahma Sūtras) (i.e. in the order in which they are treated there). In Dvaya the order of words follows the order in which the upāya and its fruit occur (i.e.) the upāya is stated first and the fruit is stated thereafter (as the former produces the latter). However, as in the mantra (taught) in the Svetāśvatara (Upaniṣad) viz. “Desirous of mokṣa I seek Thy protection)," the important point is the adoption of the upāya preceded by a desire for the fruit (aimed at); former (ācharyas) have explained that, following the logical (or psychological order), the sentence stating the fruit (namely, enjoyment and kaiṅkarya) should be thought of first. For is it not a fact that a man would never study the nature of an upāya and adopt it without previously studying the nature of the end to be attained thereby?. So also in the Tirumantra, the order of

meditation should be as stated above in regard to the upāya, and the fruit thereof. It is only if he desires the fruit and is (also) competent, that the adoption of the upāya would follow.

The words of learned men such as "One shonld seek (the Lord's) protection with (the utterance) of Dvaya" and "The śaraṇāgati which is stated in Dvaya consists in the faith that to attain Nārāyaṇa with Śrī, His two lotus feet are the upāya" - (these words) also show that Dvaya reveals the adoption of the upāya.

THE SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF DVAYA:--

Although here (in Dvaya), the first part, the words ending with the dative (or fourth) case and the namas - (although) these three are three separate sentences, yet it should be construed as a single sentence with the upāya as the primary purpose. This is how it should be construed):

The sum and substance of Dvaya is this:- "At the feet of Nārāyaṇa who is the Lord of all, who is, in everyway and supremely blissful (or enjoyable) and who is inseparable from Lakṣmī and in order that I may obtain the removal of all that is opposed to all kinds of service in all places, at all times and in all states or circumstances and to receive (the privilege of) full and perfect service to T'hem, I, who am destitute of upāyas, surrender the responsibility of the protection of myself with the accompaniment of the five aṅgas or accessories at the feet of Nārāyaṇa, so that I may not have anything to do for such things as the responsibility for protecting myself.

1. This has been taught byācāryas who had full control over their minds as a result of their indifference to worldly objects, who had won over the Lord by (their) prapatti and who were overpowered solely by their compassion (to teach it to others).

2. This (mantra) is understood as consisting of eight words (if Śrīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau should be taken as three separate words ;) of six words (if that componnd word is taken as a single word); and as a single sentence with five words where the predicate is important[^102] .

[^102]: With five words: (1) Prapadye; (2) śaraṇam: (3) Srīman Nārāyaṇa caraṇau (4) Śrīmate Nārāyaṇāya; (5) namah according to Sārāsvādinī.

3. This uniqne mantra (or this mantra consisting of a single sentence) called Dvaya has three members (sentences); it can help secure the fourth end of life (namely - mokṣa); it gives a clear idea of the five things that ought to be known; it explains the upāya with six aṅgas (prapatti); its potency or greatness is similar to that of the seven oceans; it explains the meaning of ashtakṣara, the mantra with eight letters, and it produces here (in this world?) in Śrīraṅga, in the minds of wise men[^103] (Like Śrī Rāmānuja the ninth rasa, namely, (Śānta or spiritual serenity).

[^103]: There is a reference here to Sri Rāmanuja's gadya.

We have thus explained how, by uttering, in combination, the two parts of Dvaya which are read separately in the śruti, one can seek, as refuge or upāya, the two feet of the Lord of Śrī who, out of compassion, is bent on helping us and who is prepared to pardon us; one can thus attain the Lord of the lotus.born Lakṣmī and in the region of bliss attain faultless service to the Lord) along with the full and perfect enjoyment of the Lord.

There is no śāstra superior to Vedānta; there is no higher Truth or Reality than the slayer of Madhu (Nārāyaṇa); there is nothing more holy of resort than His devotees; there is no better dwelling place than those places that are agreeable to them; there is no better means of preserving health than the quality of sattva (or eating sātvic food); there is no other way of acquiring wisdom than devotion to the wise; there is no bliss greater than mokṣa ; similarly there is no better ineans of obtaining spiritual welfare (mokṣa) than the utterance of Dvaya.
