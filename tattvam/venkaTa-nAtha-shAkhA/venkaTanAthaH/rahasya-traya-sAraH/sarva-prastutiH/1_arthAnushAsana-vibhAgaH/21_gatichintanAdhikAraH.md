Fire (archis), day.time, the bright half of the month sukla pakṣa), Uttarāyaṇa and the year, thence Vayu, Surya, Chandra and then Lightning, Varuna, Indra, Prajāpati or Brahma -- having traversed this path in the order given above, the self crosses the river Viraja; then follows the wonder that defies (all description in words.)

THE ROUTE CALLED ARCIRĀDI :

Thus the Lord who lives in the heart and who is full of love (for the Jīva  ) starts with the self who desires mukti and who has entered into the nādi in the head from out of Brahmapuri, namely, the gross body, by the Brahma Nādi, which is, as it were, the main gate (of that city). In this He resembles a king who walks to and fro with his charming child in his arins.

As has been said in the following verses :- "The self' passes through a beautiful opening in the centre of the sphere of the sun." "The "self makes an opening in the sphere of the sun, whose rays fill his chariot". "He goes through the middle of the sphere of the fiery sun", "The Lord helps him to climb up by a ladder to Vaikuṇṭha   through the sphere of the sun whose hot rays dispel the darkness and then removes the ladder," - (as described in these verses), the Lord sets the self on the path called devayına and leads him Himself with the following to guide him, namely, archis or fire, day, the bright half of the month, Uttarāyaṇa and the year, Vayu, Surya and Chandra and Lightning: with Lightning who is called also amanava and his companions, Varuna, Indra and Prajāpati, the self is helped on its way. As the Alvar

says :- " With these guides[^59] who are immortal, he reaches Vaikuṇṭha   and casts off this beautiful prison house of saṁsāra."

[^59]: Fire, Day, Śuklapakṣa Uttarāyaṇa and the year arc, of course, inanimate; but the deities presiding over them (abhimani devatas) are the guides here referred to.)

ENTERTAINMENT ON THE WAY:

The Lord has said, “I remember my devotee and lead him to the supreme goal." In every one of these regions on the way (which belong respectively to Surya, Chandra etc.), the self enjoys all those delights which are described at great length in the śāstrās of Bhagavān (Āgamas). Thereafter it arrives at a region which it has long been eager to see and which has been described as follows:- "When 'shall I see with my own eyes the world called Vaikuṇṭha  ? It shines brilliantly, it is always with Bhagavān who is possessed of the six attributes, like jñāna; it can never be attained by those who are not devoted to Viṣṇu ; it is free from the three qualities of prakṛti or matter (sattvam, rajas and tamas). It is full of the eternal sūris who divide the day into five parts and render the service to the Lord appropriate to each; it is also full of released souls who are like the eternal sūris. It has presence chambers, halls, and mansions. It is beautiful with forests and gardens; it has broad and deep wells, lakes and groves which adorn it. It is free from the sufferings due to prakṛti; it is fit to be praised by the devās. It shines like ten thousand suns shining at once; it is constituted of pure sattvam unmingled with rajas and tamas,"

As soon as the self arrives at this region, it casts off the subtle body ( sukṣma śarira) which was kept on merely for the sake of the journey and not for experiencing the fruits of past karma: it casts off this subtle body like a boat which is set adrift after the crossing of the river and when the self has crossed the river Viraja, the Lord endows the self with a body that is super - sensuous and not constituted of matter or prakṛti; it is helped to reach the lake called Airammadiyam and then to approach the asvattha tree called Somasavana and is then welcomed by five hundred celestial damsels (apsaras) with garlands, ointments, fragrant powders, raiments and ornaments. The self is then decked by them with adornments suited to Brahman and the fragrances, flavours and splendours of Brahman are made to enter into it. It is then received by the eternal sūris. As the Alwar says. "The eternal sūris with crowns on their heads come in groups to receive these self's or souls who are esteemed as the servants of Govinda in successive generations. They take the self to the tower with high walls which is adorned with banners. The self is then led to the entrance where the gates are kept by guards called Indra and Prajāpati and receives super-sensuous (aprākrita) honours befitting a king. This is described in the three verses beginning with 10.9.9.-"As soon as they (the muktas) arrive at the gate, the guards who are eternal sūris say:-" The devotees of Bhagavān are our masters. So please enter our abode". "The sūris, who were there, wondered at the blessing vouchsafed to these released souls arriving from the earth. They considered it their own good fortune that these souls entered Vaikuṇṭha   and washed their feet and beautiful women received them with treasures, fragrant powder, the pürnakumbha and the lamp. Then these souls lived ( for ever) with the eternal sūris enjoying endless delights."

Thereafter the self is led into the enchanting assembly in the hall (mantapa) set with gems. As has been said in these śloka s: "I do not know how long I have spent my time in vain with this prakṛti being subject to her sway. How can I remain associated with this prakṛti, which takes the excellent forms (or bodies of the devās), the middling forms (or bodies of men) and the mean forms (or bodies which experience the pains of hell)? I will depart from her and give up all contact with her and attain Bhagavān who is free from all blemish. I will become one with Him and I will not be one with this non - sentient prakṛti. It is in the fitness of things that I should be one with Him and not with this prakṛti", and "When shall "I see, with my eyes, Keśava who is black as a cloud, whose eyes are broad and who is playing with Lakṣmī  in the gardens? and "When shall we all see ŚrīRāma with his complexion black as a cloud and with his long arms, - Kama who is firmly set in sattva, who has taken a staunch vow to protect those that seek his help and who is bent on relieving the sorrows of the world? Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness of the whole world, ŚrīRāma will dispel all our sorrow the moment we see him" - as stated in these śloka s, the Lord reveals to the mukta His blissful form so that be may get rid of all his sorrows, enables him to acquire his essential nature (with the eight great qualities [:- freedom from sin, being without old age, without death, without sorrow, without hunger. without thirst, with all desired objects and with a will that meets with no hindrance.] ), takes him to His feet and by sāyujya with Himself - which means equal enjoyment - places him in the midst of His eternal servants (nitya süris) who enjoy eternal bliss and who (henceforth) are of the same class as he.

Then the Lord blesses him with the grant of all such services as were desired by him and as are agreeable to Himself, having previously removed all hindrances and enabled him to attain, his essential nature, in a manifest form, and without any limitations of place, time and circumstance, so that these services may last as long as his soul lasts. The Lord embraces the mukta who has arrived just now and treats him, without the slightest difference, in the same manner as He treats the sūris, who are eternally free from all imperfections and who are like friends of the same age among themselves and with the Lord. The Lord is immensely delighted at the bliss enjoyed by this eternal servant of His who is staunchly and exclusively devoted to Him, and who has attained the exalted position desired by Aḷavandār in his Stotram and by Śrī Rāmānuja in his Vaikuṇṭha-gadyam. [ In the Stotram and the Gadyam ŚrīAḷavandār and ŚrīRāma nuja cry out, as it were, saying :- When shall I go to Vaikuṇṭha   and see the Lord face to face and be His devoted and eternal servant? ]

ARCHIRĀDI IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE TO MOKSA  OR VAIKUṆṬHA. THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES AS WELL.

As in the case of such meditations as Madhu Vidyā which are the means of attaining mokṣa  after obtaining positions like those of the Vasus, “The pure" quality of sattva makes the self attain Nārāyaṇa who is of the form of Aniruddha. The Lord who is of the pure nature of Aniruddha leads him himself to the Supreme Vāsudeva (Para Vāsudeva)," and again: "Know, O, best of Brahmins, that this is the truth. Those who have become free from puṇya apd pāpa, who are devoid of karma which is like fuel kindling the fire of saṁsāra and who walk along the route to the world of Viṣṇu  - to them the sun who dispels the darkness of all the world is said to be the doorway." "This world is sustained by the sun. With their material body burnt up by the sun, they become invisible as they have no bodies and are of the nature of the soul which is atomic in size. They then enter the god Aniruddha. Having remained in the body of Aniruddha (for some time) and leaving it, they reach Pradyumna remaining now as only mind. Leaving Pradyumna, they enter into Saṅkarṣaṇa who is the deity presiding over Jīvas (abhimānidevatā). Along with them proceed those who have performed Jñāna Yoga and Karma yoga. Having become free from the three qualities (sattvam, rajas and tamas), they enter into the Supreme Being who is the abode of all, who resides within the Self and who is free from all imperfections. Know that Vāsudeva is the abode of all (vāsa) and that He is, in truth, immanent as antaryāmin in all. Those who have subjected themselves to spiritual disciplines, who have perfect control over their senses and who have attained peace of mind enter into Vāsudeva, considering Him as the only object of attainment."

(As in the case of Madhu Vidyā) and in these passages cited from the Mahābhārata, it has also been stated that there is another route for muktas :-- "They go from here to Svetadvipa, and reach gari who has the Universe as His form. Then they reach Hari in the form of Aniruddha who is in the ocean of milk. From there they go to Pradyumna, who is the Lord of Brahma and of all others. Thence they proceed to Saṅkarṣaṇa, the eternal Bhagavān. To those who want to have, for ever, the bliss of Brahman, who have attained success in being staunchly and exclusively devoted to Bhagavān and who perform the worship of the Lord in the five different periods of the day -- to them this is another path (leading to mokṣa ). In the section (devoted to Pāñcarātra in Śrī Bhāṣya, it is said also that "those who attain mukti give up the worship of the incarnational form (Vibhava), proceed thence to the worship of the Vyūha and finally after the worship of the Vyūha, attain the Supreme Being called Vāsudeva." These refer to particular classes of those who attain mukti. Similarly certain specified routes are laid down for those who attain mukti after remaining for a while in the Satyaloka, the world of Brahma. These also apply to special cases such as krama mukti (release by gradation.) It is not our object to describe these differences in the routes to mukti, which are diverse for diverse souls, as their knowledge is prescribed only to the respective adhikāris.

THE MEDITATION ON THE ROUTE. HOW USEFUL

TO THE PRAPANNA

To the man who has adopted bhakti or upāsana as his upāya, the meditation on the path to mukti has been prescribed as an aṅga to be performed daily. But to the man who has adopted prapatti as the means, there is no such need. Still, at the time of adopting this upāya, since he should know what his goal is in order that he may be competent to adopt the upāya, the meditation may help to remember the supreme goal. It becomes an end in itself, as it produces a keen delight in knowing that, very soon, the supreme goal begged for at the time of prapatti will be attained. In this respect it is like counting the days before the ensuing wedding. The prapanna will attain the desired object even by a cursory knowledge (of the path) (though the details are not known to him.)

Of this meditation on the path to mukti, the state of Sītā is an example (of whom it is said):"It looked as if Sītā was driving in the chariot of her mind drawn by her desires which were like fleet horses, towards ŚrīRāma, the greatest of kings, who was aware of his nature that always insisted on protecting those that sought his help".

Agni, Daytime, Śuklapakṣa, Uttarāyaṇa, the year, the intervening Vāyu, Sūrya, Chandra, Lightning, Varuṇa, the king of the devas, (Indra) with his umbrella (signifying rulership) and Prajāpati – by these the soul of the mukta is entertained on the way with delights and thereafter it enters the abode of bliss.

We become exhausted by frequent ascentt (to svarga) and descent back to the earth along the path of the Pitṛs (the path of smoke) like the water-pot going up and down the well by the rotation of the water-wheel. (We become exhausted likewise) by incessant journey, to and fro, along the route to hell. (So) Hari makes the various deities (on the shining path of archis) entertain us who are so exhausted and at length confers bliss on us by keeping us, as it were, under His shade which is (like the shade of a sandal tree).
