## त्रयाणां परम-पद-शब्द-वाच्यत्वम्


The svarūpa of Bhagavān is called Paramapada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the svarūpa of Bhagavān happens only after reaching a most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or svarūpa of the Jīva, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of Bhagavān which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attributes, jñāna and ānanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three have, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment.

It has been said above that such things as Bhagavān's svarūpa, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (nitya vibhūti) which is constituted of pure sattvam and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the mukta. It may be asked, “This may be true. But by sense perception (pratyakṣa) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilā vibhūti are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the śāstras also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in līlā vibhūti be objects of delight to the mukta ?" The answer is as follows:--  There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagreeable to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile has decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set him free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like- pleasures, the prison house may appear agreeable as a symbol of his father's glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : --" To be with you is mokṣa for me; to be without you is hell to me;" again, "To me living without ŚrīRāma, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rākṣasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?" In Tiruvoymozi 4-8 it is said :-"As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intelligence, my charm, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life." As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (Līlā Vibhūti), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the jīva is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a mukta enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) Bhagavān. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a man bound to saṁsāra, while to one released from the bondage of karma, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for them by the will of God.

That Bhagavān, the Lord of Śrī, who has, for his prakāra or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Nārāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in Dvaya. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of Brahman and the Bhāṣyakāra has explained it in several places in the (Śaraṇāgati Gadya ).

FULL AND PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF BHAGAVĀN

OVERFLOWS INTO KAIÑKARYA OR SERVICE.

( It is said in the śrutis that the mukta eats whatever he wants and can create whichever relations he wants). The enjoyment of food in the state of mukti and the contact with relations and the like are not due to karma, whether puṇya or papa, but are dependent only on the will of the mukta which is (always ) in accordance with the will of Bhagavān. Therefore they are not the consequences or fruits of karma, but fall into the category of pure service which is the overflow of the perfect enjoyment of Brahman. Thus the ultimate goal of attainment is the full and perfect enjoyment of Brahman which extends also to those services that are desired by the mukta. When this experience has once been attained, it never afterwards ceases and this my be seen from the following passages :

“The place from which the man who has meditated on Brahman never returns- that place is attained by him (the prapanna)"; again, “Those great souls who have attained the highest reach me and are never afterwards born in saṁsāra, which is the abode of suffering and is ever-chaṅgīng. All the worlds including that of Brahma are places, O Arjuna, from which souls return to saṁsāra. But the soul that has attained me, is, O Son of Kunti, never born again.", and further "When the man who has become dissociated from all contact with prakṛti has seen Brahman who is the 26th real, he will never be born again, because he has attained all that has to be attained.", and also "The heavenly bodies like the moon and the sun (the presiding deities that govern them) are born again in saṁsāra (after reaching their high positions). But those who meditate on Bhagavān with the mantra[^60] * of twelve syllables never come back to saṁsāra.

[^60]: Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya: with Om (or aum) preceding it.

(The same idea is evident also) in: "If a man utters the words Namo Nārāyaṇa with hands folded over the head (i.e. performs prapatti) and then goes (by the shining path), he will not be allowed to return to the world of saṁsāra, even if he furnishes security for his return to Vaikuṇṭha " and in other passages like this.(end of page 218)

Even if they come to Līlā-vibhūti (this world of ours) by their own will and pleasure which are of the form of service to the Lord, there will be no diminution of their enjoyment of Brahman and in this sense there will be no return to saṁsāra.

As regards these souls that attain this endless enjoyment of Brahman, it is not possible to say whether their last body is that of a deva, a man or other creatures. Even such beings as Brahma have to attain mokṣa. So also the great sages say : -- “Even such others as the virtuous hunter who follow gruesome professions attain the goal owing to their practice of bhakti yoga in their previous birth, as may be seen from the instance of Sramani”

THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF BLISS AMONG THE MUKTAS:

The followers of Anandatirtha take into account the superiority or inferiority of jīvas in the state of the quest for mukti and maintain that, in accordance with these degrees of merit or demerit (while in the state of seeking mukti), there would be differences in enjoyment even after they have attained mukti. They have forgotten the passages in such authorities as the śruti which speak of perfect equality with the Supreme Being in regard to enjoyment (after release from bondage).

Some hold that, in accordance with defects in the observance of the prescribed code of conduct by the seeker after mukti, there would be diminution in the bliss enjoyed. Even admitting that their words deserve serious consideration as those of trust worthy authorities, they mean only this much that, in the enjoyment of Bhagavān which occurs before mukti, there would be degrees of joy. It is true that there may be delay or no delay in attaining release from bondage, but after release is (once) attained, there is no difference at all in the enjoyment of bliss (between muktas and muktas).

Some jīvas attain, ia such worlds as those of Viṣṇu , the privilege of living in the same world as Viṣṇu  (sālokya ), some jīvas attain proximity to the presence of Viṣṇu  (sāmipya ); some attain forms similar to that of Viṣṇu  (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upacāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following śloka  - "Some live in the worlds of Viṣṇu ; others approach very near to Viṣṇu ; others, again, acquire forms resembling Viṣṇu's; yet others attain sayujya with Viṣṇu . This, alone, is called mokṣa ." This śloka  declares that only sāyujya in Paramapada is mokṣa . In the same way as a hundred and the like are included within a thousand, sālokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following śloka  : "I do not at all"A beg for mokṣa  which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee." Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the mukta, the object of enjoyment is Brahman with His prakāras or modes. Since Brahman and the mukta both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the mukta is called sayuk (with Brahman).

In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the passages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and sārshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be redundant to use two words when one would be enough?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows:

<details open><summary>विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः (सं॰प॰)</summary>

सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।  
सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥

सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।  
सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥
</details>

Sayujyam between the two (Brahman and the mukta) means that there is no difference so far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : sārshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two men may have before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of them may enjoy it more intensely than the other).

It is true that the mukta has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father who cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, Iśvara who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the mukta who only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the Brahma Sūtras has stated at the beginning of the section : "(The 'mukta's enjoyment is ) exclusive of the work of the world" and concludes it by saying:" The resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the mukta and Brahman is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the śruti s, and also by inference linga". Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on Brahman say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoyment".

REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF

IDENTITY:

To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with Brahman (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts in the śruti [ Such śrutis as the following:-Brahman is the eternal among eternals, the sentient among sentients. (1) He is one and satisfies the desires of the many: Svetasvatara Upaniṣad. 2) Without any blemish or stain he attains perfect resemblance (paramam samyam).]  which declare that Brahman is different from the jīvas. Besides, their view is opposed also to the śrutis which declare that the mukta will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to Brahman and that the mukta will be like Brahman. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- "They will attain my likeness (sādharmyam)":

The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasiṣṭa and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - "The jīva released from bondage (i.e.) the mukta, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when he reaches Him. Having attained the Omniscient Brahman, he, too, becomes omniscient. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of karma, he, too, becomes free from karma. Having attained Bhagavān who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissful, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained Bhagavān who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by karma), he, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained Bhagavān who is without the qualities (of prakṛti) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached Brahman who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (Prakṛti), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being who is independent of karma, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Having accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asuya), meditate on Brahman who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world".

In the passage cited above, the mukta is called 'independent' (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past karma. The Bhāṣyakāra (Śrī Rāmānuja) has explained the meaning of the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to karma'.

Thus since in the śrutis, the smṛtis and the sūtras, resemblance between the mukta and Brahman (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the mukta and Brahman in the state of release from bondage have to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the śruti s which declare difference between the jīva and Brahman. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such passages should be construed in the same manner as in the śloka  : "The aikyam between Rāma and Sugrīva arose O, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self's but of interests).

If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following:--

(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (Bhagavān who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the jīva-- who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the jīva), good men call them one. The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the jīva, and the jīva, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the jīva, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, O Kasyapa, karma yoga, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform jñāna yoga, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment.

(2) Puruṣottama is different from both the baddha and mukta. He is called the Supreme Being.

(3) He who is within the jīva as his Inner Ruler -- He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of prakṛti: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Puruṣa by the Vedas. The consequences of past karma do not cling to Him, in the same way as water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The jīva who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to bondage owing to past karma and attains mokṣa  by meditating on Brahman".

(4) "Just as fire in a ball of (red-hot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it".

Therefore the perfect resemblance of the jīva (parama samyam) (to Brahman) is only that arising from jñāna and bhoga (enjoyment) and the like. Iśvara has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):-- being the cause of the world, the conferring of mokṣa  on jīvas, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the one for whom all things and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one who is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want mokṣa , the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one whose essential nature is omnipresence, Jñāna and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Lakṣ mi. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The mukta's distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by Iśvara); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (śeṣatva), being atomic (aṇu) and such others.

THE MUKTA WILL NEVER BE IN SAMSĀRA AGAIN :

If it be so, it may be asked whether the mukta  who is not independent (of God) may not, for some reason or other, incur the possibility of a return to saṁsāra. The jīva's dependence on Iswars has been stated in the śloka  :-“For enabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than Puruṣottama who is competent ''. The answer to that question is, "There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- "Those who perform bhakti yoga with great devotion and those who have performed prapatti which is considered as a superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain sāyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of saṁsāra". Ever in the state of desire for mukti, the mukta had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentient things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having Brahman as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self as separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyakṣa ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to saṁsāra of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three tattvas, cit. acit and Iśvara and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contraction, there is no possibility of his ever going back to saṁsāra owing to ajñāna or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in saṁsāra deepened into the form of love called bhakti and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific nature of Bhagavān has, now, in the state of mukti, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now a vision of all aspects of Bhagavān's distinctive nature of which even the śāstra s are incapable. Therefore Iśvara's great love for him as stated in the śloka : "The jnanī is dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Omniscient though I am)" - Iśvara's love for himna is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connected with him only in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from karma, there is the possibility of his returning to saṁsāra by the will of Iśvara who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the mukta is no longer subject to the injunctions of śāstra , there is no possibility of his violating the Lord's command in the state of mukti. He cannot do anything opposed to the will of Iśvara as the Lord's pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called mokṣa , which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of Brahman and which extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Considering all this, the Sitra-kāra said: "There is no return (to saṁsāra) - no return, for the Scripture says so."
