कुतोऽपि -पा fregia: 1 [श्रीमान् वेङ्कटनाथार्यः कवितार्किककेसरी । वेदान्ताचार्यव मे सन्निधत्तां सदा हृदि ||] [Sri Stuti is one of the many stotras of Sri Vedanta Desika also called Venkatanatha (1268 A. D.- 1369 A. D.) He is perhaps the greatest of the Acaryas among the followers of the Visishtad- vaita School of Philosophy by the wealth of his qualities, intellect and accomplishments. He was a true ‘Sarva-tantra-svatantra’ (Master of all Arts and Sciences) and ‘Kavi-tarkika-simha (easily the greatest of the poets and controversial- ists). His works, in prose and verse, and in Sanskrit and Tamil, are many and varied, and range from the simplest and sweetest poems to the most difficult works on abstruse metaphy- sical subjects. His command of language is marvellous. The greatness of his works can be well imagined by the tribute paid to him by Appayya Dikshita, the veteran scholar and polemic of the Advaita School, who wrote a commentary upon Yadavabhyudaya of our author and another, it is said, on his Paduka- sahasra. Sri Desika was an equally great scholar of Tamil and the author of many poems in chaste and sweet Tamil overflowing with devotion to the Lord. His Rahasya works in the Manipravala style (Sanskrit and Tamil mixed)-beginning with the most elementary ‘Tattvapadavi’ and Rahasya- padavi’ and going up to the ‘Para-mata-Bhanga’ and Rahasya Traya Sara,’ are like a series of 10 १४६ text-books on the principles of the Visishtadvaita Philosophy and on the meaning of the Three Mantras. These form a complete and exten- sive literature on the Doctrine of Prapatti (Self- surrender); and that is the greatest service he has done to humanity in general and Visishtad- vaitins in particular. In all he has left 116 works in prose and verse, many original and a few commentaries on the works of previous Acaryas and some on his own. For want of space, I shall just give an analysis of his works according to their different topics and not a complete catalogue. There are: 9 works on Vedanta; 6 on logic and Metaphysics; 34 Rahasyas; Kavyas; one Drama; 4 of a polemic nature; 18 poems in Tamil; 29 Stotras; 3 on rituals; and 7 on diverse subjects like geo- graphy and sculpture. Of these 15 are missing completely, and 4 partially, and one, they say, is in manuscript and yet to see the light of print. The twenty-nine Stotras are devoted to Vishnu, His incarnations, His consorts, His weapons and His attendants. Sri Stuti which is given below, is one of them and is in praise of Goddess Lakshmi in 25 verses; and the following is an analysis of the contents of the poem: 1-3. Introductory –Invocation to Lakshmi to bless the poet with power to praise Her. 4-9. Greatness of Lakshmi; She and Her Consort are jointly the originators, saviours and masters of the Universe. 10-12. The diverse manifestations of Lakshmi. *The above classification is based on ‘Sri Desika-His Life and Works’ of Setlur Sri Narasimhacharya in Tamil and I am indebted to him for it. १४७ 13. The Coronation of Lakshmi. 14-19. Munificence of Lakshmi in granting the wishes of those who desire for wealth, for the realisation of the soul or for the attainment of God. 20-22. The poet as the supplicant for Her favour. 23, 24. The poet narrates how he was blessed by Lakshmi. 26. Conclusion.] मानातीतप्रथितविभवां मङ्गलं मङ्गलानां वक्षः पीटी मधुविजयिनो भूषयन्तीं स्वकान्त्या । प्रत्यक्षानुश्रविकम हिमप्रार्थिनीनां प्रजानां श्रेयोमूर्ति श्रियमशरणस्त्वां शरण्यां प्रपद्ये ॥">

[श्रीमान् वेङ्कटनाथार्यः कवितार्किककेसरी । वेदान्ताचार्यव मे सन्निधत्तां सदा हृदि ||]
[Sri Stuti is one of the many stotras of Sri Vedanta
Desika also called Venkatanatha (1268 A. D.- 1369 A. D.) He is perhaps the greatest of the Acaryas among the followers of the Visishtad- vaita School of Philosophy by the wealth of his qualities, intellect and accomplishments. He was a true &lsquo;Sarva-tantra-svatantra&rsquo; (Master of all Arts and Sciences) and &lsquo;Kavi-tarkika-simha (easily the greatest of the poets and controversial- ists). His works, in prose and verse, and in Sanskrit and Tamil, are many and varied, and range from the simplest and sweetest poems to the most difficult works on abstruse metaphy- sical subjects. His command of language is marvellous. The greatness of his works can be well imagined by the tribute paid to him by Appayya Dikshita, the veteran scholar and polemic of the Advaita School, who wrote a
commentary upon Yadavabhyudaya of our author and another, it is said, on his Paduka- sahasra.
Sri Desika was an equally great scholar of Tamil and the author of many poems in chaste and sweet Tamil overflowing with devotion to the Lord. His Rahasya works in the Manipravala style (Sanskrit and Tamil mixed)-beginning with the most elementary &lsquo;Tattvapadavi&rsquo; and Rahasya- padavi&rsquo; and going up to the &lsquo;Para-mata-Bhanga&rsquo; and
Rahasya Traya Sara,&rsquo; are like a series of
10
१४६
text-books on the principles of the Visishtadvaita Philosophy and on the meaning of the Three Mantras. These form a complete and exten- sive literature on the Doctrine of Prapatti (Self- surrender); and that is the greatest service he has done to humanity in general and Visishtad- vaitins in particular.
In all he has left 116 works in prose and verse, many original and a few commentaries on the works of previous Acaryas and some on his own. For want of space, I shall just give an analysis of his works according to their different topics and not a complete catalogue. There are: 9 works on Vedanta; 6 on logic and Metaphysics; 34 Rahasyas; Kavyas; one Drama; 4 of a polemic nature; 18 poems in Tamil; 29 Stotras; 3 on rituals; and 7 on diverse subjects like geo- graphy and sculpture. Of these 15 are missing completely, and 4 partially, and one, they say, is in manuscript and yet to see the light of print.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The twenty-nine Stotras are devoted to Vishnu, His incarnations, His consorts, His weapons and His attendants. Sri Stuti which is given below, is one of them and is in praise of Goddess Lakshmi in 25 verses; and the following is an analysis of the contents of the poem:
1-3. Introductory &ndash;Invocation to Lakshmi to bless
the poet with power to praise Her.
4-9. Greatness of Lakshmi; She and Her Consort are jointly the originators, saviours and masters of the Universe.
10-12.
The diverse manifestations of Lakshmi.
*The above classification is based on &lsquo;Sri Desika-His Life and Works&rsquo; of Setlur Sri Narasimhacharya in Tamil and I am indebted to him for it.
१४७
13. The Coronation of Lakshmi.
14-19.
Munificence of Lakshmi in granting the wishes of those who desire for wealth, for the realisation of the soul or for the attainment of God.
20-22.
The poet as the supplicant for Her favour.
23, 24. The poet narrates how he was blessed by
Lakshmi.
26. Conclusion.]
मानातीतप्रथितविभवां मङ्गलं मङ्गलानां
वक्षः पीटी मधुविजयिनो भूषयन्तीं स्वकान्त्या । प्रत्यक्षानुश्रविकम हिमप्रार्थिनीनां प्रजानां
श्रेयोमूर्ति श्रियमशरणस्त्वां शरण्यां प्रपद्ये ॥</p>
<ol>
<li>Sri (or Lakshmi) ! You are the auspicious of the auspicious and adorn the throne-like chest of (Vishnu) the Conqueror of Madhu with Your lustre. Your greatness transcends measure and is well-renowned. You are the good incarnate of all the subjects that pray for a greatness cognisable by preception and scriptures. I seek refuge in You, destitute as I am.
आविर्भावः कलशजलधौ अध्वरे वाऽपि यस्याः
स्थानं यस्याः सरसिजवनं विष्णुवक्षःस्थलं वा । भूमा यस्या भुवनमखिलं देवि दिव्यं पदं वा
स्तोकप्रज्ञैरनवधिगुणा स्तूयसे सा कथं त्वम् ॥ २ ॥
१४८</li>
<li>Goddess ! (Once) You rose from the Milky Ocean and (later) from the (Hall of) sacri- fice (of Janaka); the cluster of lotuses and the broad chest of Vishnu are Your halls of resi- dence. The entire Universe coupled with the Divine Cosmic Space (Nitya Vibhuti) is Your great wealth. You are great in every way and endowed with endless qualities; and (so) how can the shallow-minded ( like myself) praise You ?
स्तोतव्यत्वं दिशति भवती देहिभिः स्तूयमाना
तामेव त्वामनितरगतिः स्तोतुमाशंसमानः । सिद्धारंभः सकलभुवन श्लाघनीयो भवेयं
सेवापेक्षा तव चरणयोः श्रेयसे कस्य न स्यात् ॥३॥</li>
<li>If the (bodied) men praise you, they im- mediately become praiseworthy (in turn). When I, Who am helpless, wish to sing Your praise, my task becomes (by Your favour) an accom- plished fact already and I shall also be extolled by all the world. (Tell me) who is there that will not be benefited even by a wish to serve at Your feet ?
यत्सङ्कल्पात् भवति कमले यत्र देहिन्यमीषां
जन्मस्थेमप्रलयरचना जङ्गमाजङ्गमानां । तत्कल्याणं किमपि यमिनामेकलक्ष्यं समाधौ
पूर्ण तेजः स्फुरति भवतीपादलाक्षारसाङ्कम् ॥४॥
१४९</li>
<li>Kamala! There is an auspicious and all- pervasive Glory which is the one object on which all the Yogins concentrate their minds, and in which (i.e., Paramatma who has all things as His body and who is the soul of all), by its own voli- tion, the origination, sustentation and reabsorp- tion of the moving and non-moving (objects) take place. That Glory shines marked by the lac on Your feet.
निष्प्रत्यूहप्रणयघटितं देवि नित्यानपायं
विष्णुस्त्वं चेत्यनवधिगुणद्वन्द्वमन्योन्यलक्ष्यं । शेषः चित्तं विमलमनसां मौलयश्च श्रुतीनां
संपद्यन्ते विहरणविधौ यस्य शय्याविशेषाः || ५ ॥</li>
<li>Goddess ! Vishnu and Yourself form a pair united together by an unhindered love and ever inseparable. Both (of You) are endowed with endless qualities and are cognizable, one by the other, by Your mutually defining nature. The Sesha (Serpent ), the spotless minds (of Yogins) and the Upanishads (forming the head of the Vedas) serve as excellent resorts (lit. couches) for You in the course of Your Sports.
उद्देश्यत्वं जननि भजतोरुज्झितोपाधिगन्धं
प्रत्यग्रूपे हविषि युवयोरेकशेषित्वयोगात् ।
पद्मे पत्युस्तव च निगमैर्नित्यमन्विष्यमाणो
नावच्छेदं भजति महिमा नर्तयन् मानसं नः ॥ ६ ॥१५०</li>
<li>Mother Padma! (In the Nyasa yagna,) the soul is offered as an oblation to You and Your Consort, and You are the deities that should receive it directly (without an intermediary); for You are jointly the Masters. This greatness of Your Lord and Yourself, though sought for by the Vedas incessantly, never comes within their concept and it makes our hearts dance with joy.
पश्यन्तीषु श्रुतिषु परितः सुरिवृन्देन सार्धं
मध्येकृत्य त्रिगुणफलकं निर्मितस्थानभेदं । विश्वावीशप्रणयिनि सदा विभ्रमद्यूतवृत्तौ
ब्रह्मेशाद्या दधति युवयोरक्षशारप्रचारम् ॥ ७ ॥</li>
<li>The Beloved of the Paramount Sovereign of the Universe! When You and Your Consort are engaged eternally in a game of dice for Your sport, the Vedas (like ladies) together with the hosts of the Divine Angels stand around and observe. In it, the Prakriti composed of the three qualities (of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) is the chess-board kept in the centre, the differ- ent worlds (of Indra, Brahma and others) are the chequers, and Brahma, Siva and others act as the dice for You. (The creation of the world is Your sport and all the deities are but Your creatures.)
१५१
अस्येशाना त्वमसि जगतः संश्रयन्ती मुकुन्दं
Zeit: 431 aofteger facquelitia | यन्नामानि श्रुतिपरिपणान्येवमावर्तयन्तो
नावर्तन्ते दुरितपवनप्रेरिते जन्मचक्रे ॥ ८ ॥
¿
6
?</li>
<li>You have taken to Mukunda as Your re- sort and You are the Sovereign of the world. Your names like &lsquo;Lakshmi,&rsquo; Padma,&rsquo; &rsquo;the Daughter of the (Milky) Ocean,&rsquo; Vishnupatni&rsquo; and Indira are like the capital amount of the Vedas. Those who repeat them (in prayer) never again whirl in the wheel of birth (and death) which is turned by the winds of sins. (Her names are like the reserve capital, and so the Vedas do not draw on them and speak only about the Lord who is like the current amount in actual transaction.)
त्वामेवाहुः कतिचिदपरे त्वत्प्रियं लोकनाथं
किं तैरन्तःकलहमलिनैः किञ्चिदुत्तीर्यमग्नैः । त्वत्संप्रीत्यै विहरति हरौ संमुखीनां श्रुतीनां
भावारूढौ भगवति युवां दम्पती दैवतं नः ॥ ९ ॥</li>
<li>Some hold You are the Ruler of the Universe and others Your Beloved. Of what use are those people, torn by mutually conflicting opinions? For they get drowned finally (in the ocean of ignorance) though they raise their heads a bit.
But our Supreme Deities are You two forming the Couple. The Vedas that speak about Hari, and about His sports as means to Your
१५२
pleasure, have for their final goal and purport only both of You, Goddess.
आपन्नार्तिप्रशमनविधौ बद्धदीक्षस्य विष्णोः
आचख्युस्त्वां प्रियसहचरीमैकमत्योपपन्नाम् । प्रादुर्भावैरपि समतनुः प्राध्वमन्वीयसे त्वं
दूरोत्क्षिप्तैरिव मधुरता दुग्धराशेस्तरङ्गैः ॥ १० ॥</li>
<li>Vishnu is under a vow to remove the distress of the suffering (humanity) and they say You are His Beloved companion endowed with a unanimity of opinion. As the waves of the Milky Ocean are inseparable from their sweetness and so follow it wherever it goes even to distant places far receding from the shore, Vishnu in all His incarnations goes after Your suitable forms in an agreeable manner.
धत्ते शोभां हरिमरकते तावकी मूर्तिराद्या
तन्वी तुङ्गस्तनभरनता तप्तजाम्बूनदाभा । यस्यां गच्छन्त्युदयविलयैः नित्यमानन्दसिन्धौ
इच्छावेगोल्लसितलहरीविभ्रमं व्यक्तयते ॥ ११ ॥</li>
<li>That slender primaeval form of Yours, lovely like the purified (molten) gold and slightly bent by the weight of Your elevated bosoms, adds beauty to the emerald-like person of Vishnu. In this form which is like an Ocean of Bliss, the origination and reabsorption of all Your mani- festations take place eternally caused by the force
१५३
of Your will, like the waves (that rise and vanish on the surface of the ocean).
आसंसारं विततमखिलं वाङ्मयं यद्विभूतिः
यद्द्भ्रूभङ्गात् कुसुमधनुषः किङ्करो मेरुधन्वा । यस्यां नित्यं नयनशतकैरेकलक्ष्यो महेन्द्रः
पद्मे तासां परिणतिरसौ भावलेशैस्त्वदीयैः ॥ १२ ॥</li>
<li>Sarasvati has for Her wealth all the vast world of speech ever since the beginning of the Universe; by the mere knitting of the eye- brows of Parvati, the Meru-bowed (Siva ) became, almost a servant of the flower-bowed (Manmatha); and Indrani is the cynosure of all the thousand eyes of Indra. This greatness (that is found) in all the three is but the result of Your least will, Padma.
अग्रे भर्तुः सरसिजमये भद्रपीठे निषण्णां
अंभोराशेरधिगतसुधासंप्लवादुत्थितां त्वां । पुप्पासारस्थगितभुवनैः पुष्कलावर्तकाचैः
क्लृप्तारंभाः कनककलशैरभ्यषिञ्चन् गजेन्द्राः ॥ १३ ॥</li>
<li>You rose from the Milky Ocean which was rich with the nectar (that came before You), and adorned a throne of lotuses in front of Your Consort. Then the lordly elephants bathed You with (water from) the golden vases being led by the clouds like Pushkalavartaka that flooded the Universe with a rain of flowers.
१५४
आलोक्य त्वाममृतसहजे विष्णुवक्षःस्थलस्थां
शापाक्रान्ताः शरणमगमन् सावरोधाः सुरेन्द्राः । लब्ध्वा भूयः त्रिभुवनमिदं लक्षितं त्वत्कटाक्षैः
सर्वाकारस्थिरसमुदयां संपदं निर्विशन्ति ॥ १४ ॥</li>
<li>Sister (lit., twin-born) of nectar! The chiefs of the Gods saw You enthroned on the bosom of Vishnu, and with their consorts sought refuge in You distressed by the curse (of Dur- vasas). Then they got back the three worlds enriched by Your (benevolent) glances and en- joyed the wealth which began to flourish un- checked ever since.
आर्तत्राणव्रतिभिरमृतासारनीलाम्बुवाहैः
अंभोजानामुषसि मिषतामन्तरङ्गैरपाङ्गैः । यस्यां यस्यां दिशि विहरते देवि दृष्टिस्त्वदीया
तस्यां तस्यामहमहमिकां तन्वते संपदोघाः ॥ १५ ॥</li>
<li>The floods of affluence vie with one another in rushing to that quarter where Your eyes play with their glances-Your eyes which have taken the vow of saving the destitute, which are (cool) like the blue clouds showering nectar, and which much resemble the lotuses opening with the rise of the early dawn.
१५५
योगारंभत्वरितमनसो युष्मदैकान्त्ययुक्तं
धर्मं प्राप्तुं प्रथममिह ये धारयन्ते धनायां । तेषां भूमेर्धनपतिगृहात् अम्बरादम्बुधेर्वा
धारा निर्यान्त्यधिकमधिकं वाञ्छितानां वसूनाम् ॥ १६ ॥</li>
<li>There are some people in the world who are eager to begin the practice of (Karma) Yoga, and in order to carry it out and (at the same time) preserve the virtue of being devoted to You in a single-hearted manner, they long for wealth (only from You ). Towards them, the wealth rushes forth in torrents from the Earth, or the Palace of Kubera, or the sky, or from the Ocean in quantities far exceeding their wishes.
श्रेयस्कामाः कमलनिलये चित्रमाम्नायवाचां
चूडापीडं तव पदयुगं चेतसा धारयन्तः । छत्रच्छायासुभगशिरसः चामरस्मेरपार्श्वाः
श्लाघाशब्दश्रवणमुदिताः स्रग्विणः सञ्चरन्ति ॥ १७ ॥</li>
<li>Lotus-mansioned (Lakshmi) ! Persons. desirous of Beatitude just meditate in their hearts upon Your feet that are like the diadem on the heads of the Vedas (Upanishads). Anon they begin to move about with all the (royal) insignia: pairs of chowries are smiling on either side; an umbrella over the head is adding dignity to them; their ears are pleased to hear eulogistic
१५६
words; and their bodies are adorned by garlands of flowers. O wonder! (Over and above the realisation of their wants to get salvation, they enjoy wealth in this world also.)
ऊरीकर्तुं कुशलमखिलं जेतुमादीनरातीन्
दूरीकर्तुं दुरितनिवहान् त्यक्तुमाद्यामविद्यां । अम्ब स्तम्बावधिकजननग्रामसीमान्तरेखां
आलम्बन्ते विमलमनसो विष्णुकान्ते दयां ते ॥ १८ ॥</li>
<li>The Beloved of Vishnu! The spotless- minded devotees look to Your Mercy which is like the boundary line that marks the end of the series of births coming down to that of a &rsquo; Stamba&rsquo; (the smallest germ ), and pray to You to get all prosperity, to curb the greatest foes (like covetousness and anger), to remove the hosts of sins and to dispel the primaeval Nescience.
जाताकाङ्क्षा जननि युवयोरेकसेवाधिकारे
मायालीढं विभवमखिलं मन्यमानास्तृणाय । प्रीत्यै विष्णोस्तव च कृतिनः प्रीतिमन्तो भजन्ते
वेलाभङ्गप्रशमनफलं वैदिकं धर्मसेतुम् ॥ १९ ॥</li>
<li>Mother ! The blessed, who wish to do single-minded devotion to both of You, treat with contempt (lit. as trash) all the wealth of the world sprung from the Maya (of God). And for the pleasure of You and Vishnu they observe the laws laid down by the Vedas which act ends in avoiding the transgression of the limits of the Dharmic code of the Vedas.
१५७
सेवे देवि त्रिदशमहिलामौलिमालार्चितं ते
सिद्धिक्षेत्रं शमितविपदां संपदां पादपद्मं । यस्मिन् ईपन्नमितशिरसो यापयित्वा शरीरं
वर्तिप्यन्ते वितमसि पदे वासुदेवस्य धन्याः ॥ २० ॥</li>
<li>Goddess ! I salute Your lotus-like feet which the Goddesses worship with their garland- like heads, and which are like the fountain of affluence free from all misfortunes. Blessed are they that bend their heads at Your feet though slightly, for at the end of their lives, they cast off their mortal frames and go to dwell in the kingdom of God Vasudeva which is devoid of Tamas.
सानुप्रासप्रकटितदयैः सान्द्रवात्सल्यदिग्धैः
अम्ब स्निग्धैरमृतलहरीलब्धसब्रह्मचर्यैः । घर्मे तापत्रयविरचिते गाढतप्तं क्षणं मां
आकिञ्चन्यग्लपितमनघैरार्द्रयेथाः कटाक्षैः ॥ २१ ॥</li>
<li>Your lovely glances pregnant with cor- dial affection, express Your unceasing mercy and partake of the nature of nectareous waves. By Your pure and loving glances drench me, even if it be for a moment, as I am scorched by the heat caused by the threefold miseries (relating to the body, to the world and to fate) and withered by helplessness.
१५८
संपद्यन्ते भवभयतमीभानवः त्वत्प्रसादात्
भावाः सर्वे भगवति हरौ भक्तिमुद्वेलयन्तः । याचे किं त्वामहमिह यतः शीतलोदारशीला
भूयो भूयो दिशसि महतां मङ्गलानां प्रबन्धान् ॥२२॥</li>
<li>By Your grace all thoughts rise in my mind overflowing with devotion towards the Lord Hari and they are like suns in dispelling the dark fears of the mundane existence. Further with Your highly amiable and munificent nature, You are showering on me again and again heaps of good fortunes. So what more can I beg of You now ?
माता देवि त्वमसि भगवान् वासुदेवः पिता मे
जातः सोऽहं जननि युवयोरेकलक्ष्यं दयायाः । दत्तो युष्मत्परिजनतया देशिकैरप्यतस्त्वं
किं ते भूयः प्रियमिति किल स्मेरवक्त्रा विभासि ॥२३॥</li>
<li>You are my Mother, O Goddess, and Vasudeva is my Father. Therefore, Mother, I have become the one object of the compassion of You (both). Further I have been dedicated for Your Service by my masters. (Thus I have been blessed in all ways.) Still You seem to ask me, with a sweet smile glistening on Your lips, ‘what more shall I give ?” Thus You shine.
१५९
कल्याणानामविकलनिधिः काऽपि कारुण्यसीमा
नित्यामोदा निगमवचसां मौलिमन्दारमाला | संपद् दिव्या मधुविजयिनः सन्निधत्तां सदा मे
सैषा देवी सकलभुवनप्रार्थनाकामधेनुः ॥ २४ ॥</li>
<li>Lakshmi is the inexhaustible treasure of auspiciousness and the utmost limit of in- describable compassion. She is the Eternal Bliss and adorns, like a garland of Mandara flowers, the heads of the Vedas (Upanishads). She is (again) the Divine wealth of (Vishnu) the conqueror of Madhu, and is the Kamadhenu (the all-yielding Divine Cow) in granting the wishes of all (the people in) the world. May that Lakshmi dwell for ever in my heart!
उपचितगुरुभक्तेरुत्थितं वेङ्कटेशात्
कलिकलुषनिवृत्त्यै कल्पमानं प्रजानां । सरसिजनिलयायाः स्तोत्रमेतत् पठन्तः
सकलकुशलसीमासार्वभौमा भवन्ति ॥ २५ ॥</li>
<li>This Stotra of the Lotus-mansioned (Lakshmi) has risen from Venkatesa who has a full-grown devotion to Acaryas and it is capable of dispelling the faults of the Kali Age in all persons. Those that read this Stotra of Lakshmi will become paramount sovereigns and enjoy the highest happiness and prosperity.</li>
