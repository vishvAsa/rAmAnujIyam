## INTRODUCTION

The Veda-s are the oldest records of Indian tradition. The derivative sense of the word veda is that which provides a means to acquire knowledge of reality (tattva). Along with the veda-s, there has been, in existence, another stream of tradition called by the name agama. The Vedas are also called Nigama. The root gam which occurs in both these words means 'to know', besides having the sense 'to go'. The agama-s are not anti-Vedic, as they are based on the Vedic tradition. They are therefore later than the Veda-s but definitely earlier to many later literary productions.  

The Agama has some definite features which distinguish it from the Veda. At the same time, they reveal some marks akin to those of the Veda. Like the Veda, the agama is primarily concerned with the worship of God but of God in the form of an idol. Mandala (artistic and geometric drawings with coloured powders), Yantra (drawings in the form of circles in the metallic plate, the syllables of the mantra of a deity that is to be worshipped written in the petals of the lotus drawn in these circles), Mudrā (external gestures with the fingers assumed to certain positions to convey the items of worship) and others form part of the act of worship.  

While the Veda-s have been admittedly an infallible authority for knowledge, the need for admitting the Agama as a course distinct from the Veda has to be justified. A very limited number of Brahmins, conversant with the ritualistic lore, performed the rituals in which they visualised the deity whom they invoked by the mantra-s. Others, who were twice-born, women and sudra-s could not have received such a vision. There is no surprise, if they too had a yearning to behold the deity. Besides, the women and sudra-s, who were disqualified for having upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread) and therefore could not study the Veda-s, had to remain content with the satisfaction that the ritual [[Pii]] is performed. The Agama came into being to provide these people with a concrete form for worship, which would endure to be available to them for all times.  

Kashmir seems to have been the home of the Agama. The rivers Ganga and Yamuna are stated in the Pañcarātra Agama to flow in the east, and south-east respectively thereby indicating that the region where this text should have been available then must be respectively in the west and north-west of the regions through which Ganga and Yamuna flowed. Saraswati flowed to the south of that region which should be Kashmir.[^ii_1] God's grace is called Śaktipāta, alighting of power. This word occurs only in the Agama texts written in Kashmir.[^ii_2] The Yantra is to be prepared in the birch bark by drawing the diagrams. This bark is available only in Kashmir.[^ii_3]  
[^ii_1]: PS.31. 106b - 107b  
[^ii_2]: LT. 36.38; Ahs. 26.75  
[^ii_3]: Ibid. 13.8; Ibid. 14 28b-30  

Regarding the name Pañcarātra, there is a lot of confused accounts for determining its sense. Most of them are ingenous and are incorrect also. The word Pañcarātra is a compound made up of two parts pañca and rātra. The former denotes the number and the latter means the day and night together (ahorātra). Any explanation for this word should convey the significance of these two parts Whatever be the explanation offered in the Pañcarātra texts, the reasonable explanation lies in taking the name to refer to the five divisions of the day made in this Agama for purposes of attending to the worship of God at the particular parts of the day marked by these divisions.[^ii_4]  
[^ii_4]: The five divisions are Abhigamana, Upādāna, Ijyā, Svādhyāya and Yoga. These names refer to the acts that are to be done during the parts of the day marked by them. The explanation of the name Pañcarātra is supported by the second concluding śloka in the Pañcarātrarakṣā.  

Another interpretation deserves consideration. Nārāyaṇa is stated to have taught five sages the doctrines of the system. The names of these sages are given as Śāṇḍilya, Aupagāyana, Mauñjyāyana, Kauśika and Bharadvāja.[^ii_5] Here, rātra must be taken to mean not in the sense of the whole day (ahorātra) but day with a part of the night included. Since these sages were promulgators of the doctrines of the system, the name Pañcarātra could have been given to this system. Yet, it is hardly possible to believe that the name of a system could have been given on the number of promulgators or teachers who preached those doctrines. There is also the difficulty of explaining the word rātra in this interpretation.  
[^ii_5]: Īśvarasaṁhitā. 21.519-533  

The Āgamas are of two kinds, as far as Vaiṣṇavism is concerned. They are Vaikhānasa and Pañcarātra. The former is based on the purely Vedic traditions. The latter, has a Tantric character.  

Many arguments are advanced questioning the authority of the Pañcarātra. Firstly, Tāntrika mantra-s are used in the place of the Vedic mantras. Śūdras and women are allowed to undergo initiation for worshipping God which runs against the authority of the Vedic and Vedāṅga authority.[^iii_6] The Vedic rituals enjoining invocation (āvāhana) and send-off (visarjana) to the deities during ritualistic performances are given up. Contrary to this, the deity is worshipped in the concrete form of the idol.  
[^iii_6]: Brahmasūtras Utpattyasaṁbhavādhikaraṇa 2.2.39-42  

Secondly, the Brahmasūtra-s condemn the authority of the Pañcarātra on the ground that the soul with the name Saṁkarṣaṇa is stated here as born of Vāsudeva. Similarly, Pradyumna and Aniruddha who are mind and ego are born respectively of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Pradyumna. Neither the self is born nor mind and ego spring out of the self or mind. Therefore the Pañcarātra, which thus flouts the authority of the Vedas, cannot be admitted as authentic.  

Thirdly, Śāṇḍilya is stated in the Paramasaṁhitā,[^iii_7] a Pañcarātra text, to have become disappointed by not getting what is good from the study of the Vedas and Vedāṅgas. He acquired what was good for him by a study of the Pañcarātra. This goes against Vedic authority and questions the validity of the Vedas. This proves the invalidity of the Pañcarātra.  
[^iii_7]: Pās. 1.3,4  

Lastly, the Vaikhānasa texts contain severe criticism of the validity of this Āgamas.[^iii_8] On these grounds, the Pañcarātra Āgama is held to lack in authority and so is to be discarded.  
[^iii_8]: Samūrtārcanādhikaraṇa - prāyaścitta chapter.  

[[Piv]]  
While answering these objections, it is necessary to take note of the Pañcarātra Āgama's attitude to the Veda. Vedic mantras are profusely cited in the Āgama texts.[^iv_9] These are in addition to the Tāntrika mantra-s that are enjoined for each practice. The name Saṁhitā to the Āgama texts such as Sāttvatasaṁhitā, Pauṣkarasaṁhitā and others, use of various kinds of fire pits (Kuṇḍa)[^iv_10] for performing homa, names yāga and ijyā for worship, and the word avabhṛtha referring to the concluding session of the mahotsava, all go to show that the Śrauta practices had a deep influence on the Āgama-s. This resulted in the use of the above mentioned expressions for attending to the worship of God.  
[^iv_9]: Pās (caryāpāda) has more than 100 Vedic mantras. Kriyakairavacandrikā has 180 Vedic mantras.  
[^iv_10]: Fourteen kinds are mentioned in Śrīpraśna saṁhitā. 18.  

The entire population comprises of women and Śūdras with few exceptions. These people were denied Upanayana and consequently could not perform worship. It is the liberal outlook of the Āgama to boldly prescribe Tāntrika mantra-s for these people. The idol is thus brought in to be worshipped by them. This practice is not anti-Vedic but non-Vedic.  

Validity of the Pañcarātra system which is assailed in the Brahmasūtra-s, is defended by Yāmunācārya in his Āgamaprāmāṇya and by Rāmānuja following him in his Śrībhāṣya, Vedāntasāra and Vedāntadīpa. The Viśiṣṭādvaita school, holds that Vyāsa, who maintained the Pañcarātra Āgama as valid in the Śāntiparvan of the Mahābhārata, would not have rejected its validity in the Brahmasūtra-s composed by him. Hence, it is prudent to take the sūtra-s (2.2.39 & 40) as conveying the points for rejection of validity to Pañcarātra and the other two sūtra-s (2.2.41&42) as defending its validity and establishing it. Besides, the Pañcarātra system nowhere declares the soul as having birth.  

Thirdly, Śāṇḍilya's saying that he could get the good which we wanted from the Pañcarātra and not the Veda does not mean that he decried the authority of the Veda. It means only that he could not get the good from the Veda and so expresses his inability to get it.  

[[Pv]]  
Lastly, the Vaikhānasa's attack on the Pañcarātra is due to rivalry between the Vaikhānasā and Pañcarātra followers who sought to acquire more power and emoluments in cash and kind from the temples. This bitter attack on the Pañcarātra is contained in all the available works of the Vaikhānasā system. The Ratnatraya, Lakṣmī tantra, Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā, Sanatkumāra Saṁhitā and other early texts do not contain even a single reference against the Vaikhānasa system or its inferiority. Vedānta Deśika brushes aside this mutual attack and points to its rise as the work of mischief mongers who exploit such situations.[^v_11]  
[^v_11]: Nyāyapariśuddhi (Annangaracharya's edn). P. 169.  

Validity of the Pañcarātra is indicated in the Mahābhārata,[^v_12] Āgamaḍambara[^v_13] and Spandapradīpikā.[^v_14] Thus validity of Pañcarātra stands unassailed.  
[^v_12]: Mahābhārata Śāntiparvan - Nārāyaṇīya section.  
[^v_13]: Jayantabhaṭṭa's Āgamaḍambara 4.62.  
[^v_14]: Spandapradīpikā of Utpala P. 2  

The long period of development of the Pañcarātra system could be roughly divided into two stages. The date or period marking one stage from another could not be fixed. The first stage had both the theoretical and practical aspects of the system developed to a remarkable degree. Ultimate Reality is stated to be Brahman identified with Viṣṇu.[^v_15] Śakti, the female principle, is ever associated with Him and the two are held to be one reality. Unlike the Sāṅkhya system, and like the Śākta and Śaiva Āgama-s, the Pañcarātra treats Śakti as sentient and active. It accounts for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe. It is called by the name Lakṣmī. The supreme form of both is one of knowledge. Viṣṇu, who is also stated to have the names Nārāyaṇa, Bhagavān and Vāsudeva, possesses six qualities Jñāna-Knowledge, aiśvarya-lordship, bala-strength, vīrya-virility, śakti-potency and tejas-splendour. These constitute into a group called Ṣāḍguṇya. Viṣṇu and Śrī are held to have this group as their body.[^v_16]  
[^v_15]: Cf. LT. 2.11a  
[^v_16]: Ahs. 6.25a  

Creation is held to be of three kinds, pure, mixed (of pure and impure). The first marks the stage when Śakti emanates to give relief to the souls which are in bondage. Ultimate Reality divides itself into Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniru- [[Pvi]] ddha, the succeeding form arising from the preceding one. Each one has all the six qualities, yet the purpose of this division is to enable the universe to be dissolved through Saṁkarṣaṇa who possesses jñāna and bala to a relatively high degree. He is also in charge of spreading the Pañcarātra Āgama. Pradyumna has a preponderance of vīrya and aiśvarya and attends to the work of maintaining the created world in a stable condition. He attends to the practise of the Āgama principles. Creation is attended to by Aniruddha with excess of śakti and tejas. He rewards the results of the deeds done by people.  

The mixed kind of creation is marked by the emanations of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Rudra and their consorts. The impure kind is of material nature following the principles of the Sāṁkhya system.  

Viṣṇu is stated to take five forms called Para, Vyūha, Vibhava, Arcā and Antaryāmin. Para is the transcendental form. Vibhava includes the ten divine descents (avatāra) and also thirty eight,[^vi_17] or thirty nine forms,[^vi_18] which He takes from time to time. Arcā represents God in the form of idol, which He though formless, takes this finite form to show favour to His devotees.[^vi_19] The form of Antaryāmin is to remain within the self and control it by directing it to lead a virtuous way of life, of course in accordance with the residues of the deeds done by it.  
[^vi_17]: LT. 11.19-25  
[^vi_18]: Ahs. 5.50 - 56  
[^vi_19]: SS. 2.91  

Regarding the means of getting freedom from bondage, Karma, Jñāna, Yoga and Prapatti are enjoined.[^vi_20] These are to be practised in the light of the five-fold classification of the daily routine. In particular, Prapatti gets a very detailed treatment in the Pañcarātra Āgama,[^vi_21] Release from bondage is of the nature of close communion (Sāyujya) with God.  
[^vi_20]: LT. 15-17  
[^vi_21]: Ibid. 17, Abs. 37  

Treatment of mantra-s, their varieties and their component parts receive an elaborate treatment in the Lakṣmītantra, Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā and Jayākhya Saṁhitā. Influence of the Vedic practises is felt in this Āgama where God is treated as Mantradeha, [[Pvii]] having mantra for His body. The mantras are to be used with accuracy of pronunciation and accent. Any one cannot undertake the act of worship. Initiation (dīkṣā) is a preliminary must for every individual. The process is very elaborate, with much responsibility thrown on the priest who initiates his pupils. Worship of the idol is enjoined and this is called Bāhiryāga, external worship. Mentally, the worshipper must undertake the act of worship (antaryāga) and this should precede Bāhiryāga. Yantra, Maṇḍala, Nyāsa and Mudrā play a leading role in the acts of worship. All these are treated in great detail in the Ratnatraya (Sāttvata, Pauṣkara and Jāyākhyasaṁhitā-s), Lakṣmī tantra and Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā. There is however no reference in these texts to the details about building of temples, installation of the idol, conduct of the festivals and others. It is safe to hold that the first stage in the development of the Pañcarātra Āgama could have come to an end with the rise of these texts. Perhaps, the period may be fixed tentatively about 800 A.D.  

The second stage is marked by ceaseless activity on the part of the rich patrons (Yajamāna) to promote building temples and arranging for the installation of the idols and for the celebration of the festivals. Most of the Pañcarātra texts, other than the five mentioned above, treat these matters. It is at this period, the matters dealt with in the Pañcarātra texts, as doctrines in theory and practise, were classified under four heads, Jñānapāda, Yogapāda, Kriyāpāda and Caryāpāda. The first section deals with the nature of reality like Brahman, Śakti, creation and others. The second enjoins the practise of Yoga as a means of visualising God within one's own self. Kriyā refers to the building of temples and installation of idols there. Caryā treats the conduct of daily and occasional festivals, acts of expiation for lapses and work of renovation when there is disrepair in temples. Worship done to the idos in temples is called Parārtha Yajana (worship for others' sake) and to the idol or Śāligrāma in houses called Svārthayajana (worship for one's own sake).  

[[Pviii]]  
It is surprising to note that Pañcasaṁskāra[^viii_22] does not get the treatment in the earlier texts of this Āgama. This is treated in the Parameśvara, Viṣṇu tattva, Pārāśarya saṁhitā, Parameṣṭhya saṁhitā, Bhāradvāja saṁhitā, Sanat-Kumāra saṁhitā, Nāradīya saṁhitā and Īśvara saṁhitā, which are later than the earlier texts.[^viii_23] The practise is of very ancient origin as evidenced from the voluminous citations found in Vedānta Deśika's Saccaritarakṣā. The later texts of the Pañcarātra Āgama make this as obligatory.  
[^viii_22]: Saccaritarakṣā. 1  
[^viii_23]: Ratnatraya, LT and Ahs.  

The texts of the Pañcarātra Āgama in print and manuscripts are stated to be 108 in number.[^viii_24] There are however 225 works, some of which are fragmentary enumerated in the introduction to the Lakṣmītantra.[^viii_25] The texts are mostly ancient and could hardly be assigned to any particular period and in a chronological order. Yet, the Ratnatraya[^viii_26] are held to be the earliest. The Sāttvatasaṁhitā devotes itself mainly to the worship of Vyūha and Vibhava deities. Initiation is also dealt with at length. Maṇḍala-s and shrines get an elaborate treatment in the Pauṣkarasaṁhitā. The Jayākhyasaṁhitā contains an elaborate treatment of the Mantra-s, creation, worship, initiation and Nyāsa. The Lakṣmī tantra, has the Śākta element. It is devoted mainly to the role played by Śakti in the system. Creation, Mantra-s, Nyāsa, worship and Prapatti receive a detailed treatment. Mantra-s and yantra-s are treated in detail in the Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā. Supreme importance is assigned in this work to Sudarśana. The Īśvarasaṁhitā is based on the Sāttvata and is adopted in the temple at Melkote. Based on the Pauṣkarasaṁhitā is the Parameśvarasaṁhitā. This is practised in the temple at Śrīraṅgam. It is highly informative. The Pādmasaṁhitā, which is adopted in the temple at Kāñcī, is based on the Jayākhyasaṁhitā. It is a very long text divided into four pāda-s and contains almost all the aspects of the Āgama fully treated. It is the only text containing all the pādas. It is very much in use in most of the Pañcarātra governed temples. The Paramasaṁhitā is also an ancient text and treats many topics such as creation, initiation and installation. The Sanatkumāra Saṁhitā is divided into five sections called Brahmarātra, Śivarātra, Indrarātra, Ṛṣirātra and Bṛhaspatirātra, the last of which is lost.

[[Pix]]  
Sage Sanatkumāra received information on several topics from Brahmā, Śiva, Indra, sages and Bṛhaspati. Hence his name is given in the title of the text. This text refers to Viṣṇuliṅga[^ix_27] and Viṣṇu as having forms in gradations; Viṣṇu, Mahāviṣṇu and Sadāviṣṇu.[^ix_28] Among others, the following could be mentioned for the treatment of the system, each containing some speciality for the nature of the topics. Nāradīyasaṁhitā, Pārāśarasaṁhitā, Bhāradvājasaṁhitā, Mārkaṇḍeyasaṁhitā, Viśvāmitrasaṁhitā, Viṣṇutattva, Viṣṇutilaka, Viṣṇusaṁhitā and Śrīpraśnasaṁhitā.  
[^ix_27]: SKS. Brahmarātra. 6.50b - 52b  
[^ix_28]: Ibid. 6.138 - 139  

This Āgama received detailed treatment at the hands of Yāmunācārya (10th century) and Vedāntadeśika (1268-1369). Validity of the Pañcarātra is firmly established by Yāmunācārya in his Āgama Prāmāṇya. The Pañcarātṛarakṣā of the Vedāntadeśika is a valuable text as it deals with the Siddhānta-s which are four in number, Pañcakāla prakriyā and a commentary on Rāmānujā's Nitya. These works of the two Ācārya-s do not refer to temple construction and conduct of festivals. Many manuals were in later days written on the system. Among them, specific mention must be made of the Kriyākairavacandrikā of Varāhaguru. It deals with the Kriyā and Caryā aspects of the system. Tantrasāra of Vedāntarāmānuja of the last century is an important work on the Siddhāntas and practises of the Pañcarātra system.  

The latest addition to the Pañcarātra is the Pañcarātṛapāramya, now published for which the introduction is contained here. This work is the mature production of the erudite Vidwān T. Vīrarāghavāchārya. He was fully conversant with the fundamental doctrines of all the systems of Indian Philosophy. With his amazingly analytical intellect he did make use of his learning for interpreting the most obstruse problems in Indian philosophy which baffled many scholars.  

The Pañcarātra Āgama holds ultimate reality to be Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa, thus revealing the vaiṣṇava character. The Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta is Vaiṣṇavite to the core. For a long time, the two had been kept apart from each other. Adoption of the Pañcakālaprakriyā to govern the routine life of a Paramaikāntin,[^ix_29] Pañcasaṁskāra, Pra- [[Px]] patti and the process of attending to daily worship to God, generally in the houses mark the practises, which have been in vogue in the Vaiṣṇava families. These bear the full influence of the Pañcarātra Āgama. No attempt seems to have been made till recently to effect the rapproachment between the Pañcarātra Āgama and the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta. The place given to temple worship, conduct of festivals and temple building are governed, as far as Vaiṣṇavism is concerned by the Pañcarātra and Vaikhānasa rules and regulations. The attraction which the people are provided with these has resulted in treating these as the only items and topics dealt with in the Vaiṣṇava Āgama-s. The theological, cosmological and philosophical aspects of the Pañcarātra Āgama have been completely forgotten. It is these aspects that form the foundations for the edifice of Kriyā and Caryā pāda-s of the Āgama. These are dealt with in the Upaniṣads, Vedānta texts and Dharmaśāstra-s. The epics and Purāṇa-s contain sufficient information on the principles and practises of Vaiṣṇavism. There cannot exist two sources for Vaiṣṇavism in the forms of Āgama and Veda-s and sources based on the Veda-s. It is the duty of the learned to examine these two sources and determine the nature of Vaiṣṇavism on a comparative and harmonious study of these two sources. The author of this book has successfully carried out this duty. His attempt is found in the main, to find that the two sources are not at variance with each other and supports this conclusion by drawing evidences from the Āgama-s and the sources based on the Veda-s. The evidences so collected are subjected with great care and skill, to a critical inquiry doing adequate justice to their prestige in the sources without loss of vigour and precision.  
[^ix_29]: Paramaikāntin is one who is exclusively devoted to Viṣṇu and for whom God Viṣṇu is everything.  

There are nearly sixty headings under which the Pañcarātra is shown to be supreme. The topics dealt with in them are sometimes terse for comprehension and are also presented with well-reasoned arguments. To attempt at bringing out even the substance of each is an uphill task. Adequate justice cannot also be done to a brief treatment of the important topics. Therefore an attempt could be made only to offer a brief reference to some of them.  

[[Pxi]]  
At the outset, it is shown that gods possess forms, a matter which is seriously challenged by the Mīmāṁsakās particularly by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa. This is briefly set aside by showing that Vyāsa, the author of the Brahmasūtras was in favour of admitting Gods' possession of forms.  

Śaṅkara is held to have declared the Pañcarātra system as invalid on the ground that it mentions the soul. Saṁkarṣaṇa to have been born out of Vāsudeva, Śaṅkara does not reject the Vyūha concept or the Pañcakālaprakriyā. Yet, he takes objection to the treatment of the Vyūha deities as not different from Vāsudeva. This objection cannot stand, since the divine descents of Viṣṇu (Vāsudeva) as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa will have to be treated as losing divinity and not descents at all. Śaṅkara admits in a different context,[^xi_30] the vyūha concept. Hence the objection is flimsy. The Bhāmatī, Kalpataru and Parimala, which are commentary, subcommentary and commentary on the subcommentary on Śaṅkara's Brahmasūtrabhāṣya - argue that Pañcarātra Āgama contains the expressions of God Nārāyaṇa and so could not be held as invalid. The passage on which the objection is based occurs in the Pañcarātra Āgama. This passage will have to be explained without contradiction to the statements of the Vedas which declare that the soul is eternal. Reconciliation between the two statements should be made by taking the word birth in its secondary sense. Through Kṛtvā cintā, what is contradictory is first admitted and then rejected. Thus the statement of the birth of the soul is only apparently opposed to the Vedas and therefore the Pañcarātra Āgama is valid.  
[^xi_30]: Vide: Śaṅkara's on the names Caturātman and Caturvyūha in the Viṣṇusahasranāma.  

To the question as to how the qualities jñāna and others be themselves the possessor of them, the answer is that identity of this kind is found in the Vedic pasages like 'Food is verily the vital air' (annaṁ vai prāṇaḥ).[^xi_31]  
[^xi_31]: Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.6.1  

[[Pxii]]  
That Saṁkarṣaṇa and other two deities of the Vyūha are also Vāsudeva is elaborately discussed by citing passages from the Lakṣmītantra and Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā. That Śāṇḍilya had to study the Pañcarātra to get what he could not from the Vedic and allied texts is fully analysed by bringing a large number of passages from the Viṣṇutilaka, Āgama prāmāṇya and Śrībhāṣya and is settled as authentic. In this context, the Piṣṭapaśuyāga, which is described in the Mahābhārata as performed by Uparicara Vasu, is upheld as authoritative, with carefully arranged citations from various sources.  

The Pāśupata system is rejected in the Brahmasūtras 2.2.37-41 on the ground that it maintains that Paśupati (Śiva) is the instrumental cause of the world. This goes against the Upaniṣadic doctrine that Brahman is both the material and instrumental cause, and therefore it is refuted like Sāṁkhya, Yoga, Nyāya and other systems.  

Śrīkaṇṭa, the author of a commentary on the Brahmasūtras, contends that the Pāśupata system is two fold, authoritative and unauthoritative. The latter includes the Vāmācāra practises and therefore is impure. It includes within its fold the Lāguḍa, Kāpālika, Kālāmukha and others which are nonvedic and is therefore condemned in the Brahmasūtras. These are thus Śaṁkara too refuted. The former kind is Vedic. To maintain that Brahman, as Śiva, is both the material and instrumental cause in this system, Śrīkaṇṭa takes such passages from the Śaivāgama texts which are shown to convey that Śiva is the material cause and seeks to support the authority of the Pāśupata system. Other passages in the Śaiva Āgama are shown to be either invalid or as admitting some other purport. The author rejects this interpretation, since sūtra 2.2.37 declares that there is inadequacy (asāmañjasya) in the argument of having Śiva as the Supreme deity. There is no adequate reason in support of this contention. Veda cannot justify this, as the Pāśupata system admits Veda as the composition of God. Paśupati is to be proved at first as the Supreme Being. This cannot be achieved through the Veda. The Śaivāgama cannot be of any help, as it is held to have been promulgated for deceiving others. Śiva is held to be the instrumental cause. He is not omniscient and so [[Pxiii]] there is no adequate evidence in admitting the authority of the Pāśupata system. On the contrary, there is nothing wanting in the Pañcarātra system to be admitted as Vedic except the theory of the soul's birth.  

After showing that objections could not be raised against validity of the Pañcarātra, the author establishes harmonious blending of the Pañcarātra and the Bhagavadgītā. Advocating the means of devotion, the Lord asks Arjuna to take to Karmayoga with reference to God.[^xiii_32] Rāmānuja gives a theistic interpretation to Karmayoga by taking Karma to stand for building of temples, gardens, lighting the lamps, sweeping the yards, bringing flowers, offering worship, singing the praise of God and others.[^xiii_33] Worship of God is stated at the outset in the Gītā while dealing with Karmayoga.[^xiii_34] Use of the petals of flowers, fruits and others could be offered only to the form of idol of God. It must be noted here that the Varāhapurāṇa enjoins the use of the Tāntrika mantras, if the Vedic mantras are not available.[^xiii_35] This enriches the worth of the Pañcarātrāgama which enjoins the use of Tāntrika Mantras.  
[^xiii_32]: Bhg. 12.10  
[^xiii_33]: Rāmānuja on Ibid.  
[^xiii_34]: Bhg. 4.25  
[^xiii_35]: Varāhapurāṇa 66.11  

With great ingenuity, the author remarks that Nārāyaṇa himself gave out Pañcarātra, meaning that He who is the purport of the Veda is himself is the author of the Pañcarātra. Karmayoga is only worship of God in the form of idol. Rāma, a descendant of the sun (Vivasvān), worshipped Śrī Raṅganātha. Kṛṣṇa tells in the Gītā that He taught this Karmayoga to sun (Vivasvān), who taught it to Manu. Manu gave it to Ikṣvāku of the solar dynasty.[^xiii_36] Worship of God in the form of the idol is thus emphasised in the Gītā.  
[^xiii_36]: Bhg 4.1  

The Pañcarātrāgama is closely allied to the Veda. The duties enjoined in the Śrautasūtras are to be followed. Vaiśvadeva, a rite enjoined by the smṛtis is to be done after offering the food preparations to God.[^xiii_37] The Pañcarātra Āgama is mainly devoted to the worship of God. Therefore, it cannot be expected to contain information as to how life is to be lead on occasions other than attending to the worship of God. Secular activities also will have to be attended to, for which the guidelines are contained in the Dharma and Gṛhya sūtras and in the Dharmaśāstras. There is the need for a Pāñcarātrika to follow the texts based on the three vedas.[^xiii_38]  
[^xiii_37]: Viṣṇutilaka 3.445  
[^xiii_38]: Pās.2.5.18  

[[Pxiv]]  
Now a question arises as to what explanation is to be given to the passage. "One who undertakes yoga and enters into a meditative mood will feel that he is Brahman". He is still like a pillar and does not enjoy the objects of life. This passage suggests that here there is the experience that Brahman and the soul are one. This would mean that this passage supports the sense of the Upaniṣadic passage 'I am Brahman'... Besides, according to Bhūtaśuddhi[^xiv_39] described in the Pañcarātra Āgama, the aspirant loses the imperfect material body and assumes a non-material body. It is said that here the aspirant becomes God and worships Him.  
[^xiv_39]: Human body is impure made up of matter as it is and so is unfit to make use of it for worshipping God. The worshipper must therefore make the effect merge into its cause. This is a mental process. For instance, odour is to merge in earth which shall get dissolved within taste. Taste shall merge into water and water into colour and so on until, the physical body is felt to have been completely destroyed. The worshipper should then feel receiving the flow of nectar from Viṣṇu's foot on the destroyed body. Then there is produced pure matter which evolves into effects finally bringing a fresh body which shall be made use for worship. This process is called Bhūtaśuddhi.  

In answer to this, the author states that the soul is identical with Brahman only by being the body of Brahman and that could not exist without Brahman. In the other case, the aspirant must be taken to mean that he had then got a form purified for acquiring fitness for performing worship. Or, the soul becomes God, that is, gets Brahman as the inner controller of his body.  

The Pañcarātra system is held to be based on Ekāyana veda. This veda is stated to be the root of the Vedas. King Bhoja is said to have referred to it. It is further said that this nature of the Ekāyanaśākhā was dealt with in the Kāśmīrāgamaprāmāṇya.[^xiv_40] Pañcarātra, is based on the statement-"There is no other way to get out of this world"[^xiv_41], and so no argument will be effective to set aside full validity to the Pāñcarātrāgama.  
[^xiv_40]: Āgamaprāmāṇya P. 170 GOS. Baroda.  
[^xiv_41]: Nānyaḥ panthā vidyate'yanāya - Taittirīya āraṇyaka 3.12.7.  

A system must give information on tattva Reality. The Pañcarātra Āgama is shown by the author to deal with the nature of ultimate Reality. Passages are profusely cited from the Pauṣkara and Padma saṁhitās. Brahman is formless.[^xiv_42] Treatment of Ṣāḍguṇya in the Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā[^xiv_43] is stated by the author as very helpful in declaring Brahman as Saguṇa. It is shown that many passages from the Upaniṣads are not properly explained in the systems of Śaṁkara and Bhāskara. Such passages become meaningful only when the expressions occuring in the source books are interpreted by taking Brahman as saguṇa.  
[^xiv_42]: Pās. 1.5.29 Cf. JS. 4.60  
[^xiv_43]: Ahs. 6.25a  

[[Pxv]]  
The Pañcarātra Āgama treats the soul to be of the size of the triad (trasareṇu), but the Viśiṣṭādvaita system does not admit this and maintains the size to be of that of the atom. Rāmānuja's system does not also admit oneness (aikya) of Brahman with the soul which is however admitted in the Pañcarātra system. The author expresses his disagreement with this Pañcarātra doctrine. Three kinds of the released state are stated in the Pañcarātra texts.[^xv_44] They are of the nature of difference, non-difference and an admixture of both. The released state becomes marked by service. The released souls do then service to God. The second kind is one of intense identity between the Brahman and the soul. The soul then realises that it is Brahman. In the third kind, the Lord is made by the soul get delighted by worship. This is from the attitude of difference. Oneness is achieved from the angle of non-difference. The author observes that which among difference and non-difference marks the state of release could not be settled in this case. In a different context, attainment of bliss is stated in the Pañcarātra text, to mark the state of release.[^xv_45] The author shows that this must be admitted as the doctrine of the Pañcarātra and so the soul is different from Brahman in the state of release.  
[^xv_44]: Pās. 1.8. 28b - 36a  
[^xv_45]: Ibid. 1.8. 35b  

The Pañcarātra texts accord to Śrī a place of position equal to that of Viṣṇu. The author cites passages from the Lakṣmī tantra to explain the position of Śrī. The Viśiṣṭādvaita system follows closely the Āgama in admitting Śrī's place. Like Viṣṇu, Śrī also is the means and goal.  

Pañcarātra is also called Siddhānta and is of four kinds with the names Āgamasiddhānta, Mantrasiddhānta, Tantrasiddhānta and Tantrāntarasiddhānta. The author argues that Āgamasiddhānta was practised in the Kṛtayuga and is now lost. The three texts Sāttvata, Pauṣkara and Jāyākhyasaṁhitās belong to the Mantrasiddhānta. The practises that are recommended for worshipping the departed souls are not exclusively attached or drawn from one of the Ratnatraya. The author offers a well reasoned treatment for the classification of the Āgamas according to the Siddhāntas [[Pxvi]] the three guṇas sattva, rajas and tamas. His discussion is helpful to understand Vedāntadeśika's treatment of this matter in the Pañcarātṛarakṣā.  

How the mantras are to be formed afresh and analysed are treated only in the Pañcarātra texts. Gross, subtle and transcendental aspects of important mantras are treated in the Ahirbudhnyasaṁhitā.[^xvi_46] The Vaikhānasas too have to depend upon the Pañcarātra rules for the method of doing japa of important mantras. Every act of daily routine could be done in accordance with the dictates of one's own sūtra. Yet, the Pañcarātra texts declare that the Pañcarātra mode of worship is supreme. Prapatti is admitted as a means of mokṣa in the Vaikhānasa system. However, its treatment is available only in the Pañcarātra texts. The Vaikhānasas too have to turn to the Pañcarātra Āgama, for information on some of the religious issues.  
[^xvi_46]: Ahs. 52  

To The tradition of the Vaiṣṇavas is found to depend very much on the Pañcarātra āgama to get information on important issues and get problems resolved only through the contents of this āgama. The community of the Vaiṣṇavas, is much indebted to the authority of the Pañcarātra āgama.  

Much dialectical skill is revealed by the author of this work in solving the problems of interpretation of crucial passages in the Upaniṣads, Dharmaśāstras and Pañcarātra āgama. Quite often, he draws references to the Vaikhānasa Āgama and offers a comparative note on the treatment of the topics in the Pañcarātra and Vaikhānasa āgamas. He has successfully undertaken a study of the Pañcarātra āgama in the light of Śrīvaiṣṇavasampradāya and has done due justice to both without any partisanic attitude.  

Śrī Vidwān Uttamūr Vīrarāghavāchārya who had done yeoman service to Sanskrit Śāstras by editing many rare and standard works with his splendid commentaries, is the author of this work Pañcarātra pāramya. It will be a futile exercise to expatiate on the nature of the contribution he has made to the Pañcarātra Āgama through this work.  

[[Pxvii]]  
Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati has undertaken the publication of this work. This is just the beginning of the interest which it displays in the pursuit of promotion of Sanskrit Studies, particularly Śāstras which are the foundations of Hindu culture. It is hoped that more and more works of this kind would be published in the years to come, much to the delight and appreciation of Sanskrit scholars in India and abroad.  

Paṇḍit Lakṣmīnarasiṁha Bhaṭṭa, a follower and adherent of the Pañcarātra tradition has undertaken the task of publishing a work of this kind. This indicates that he, like many others who are interested in the publication of works on Pañcarātra, is earnest and puts forth his zeal and enthusiasm in undertaking of this kind. He is to be thanked by all scholars of Sanskrit and deserves encouragement for evincing deep interest in these publications.
