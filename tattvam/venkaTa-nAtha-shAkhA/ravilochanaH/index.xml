      <description>&lt;p&gt;Puranic episodes are not considered as entirely pramana by Vaishnavas. It is not that one purana is pramana and other is not. Rather even statements from so called tamasika puranas are also considered as pramana while some from sattvika are not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Valmiki Ramayana is considered as parama pramana (with little interpolations). The yardstick used by SVs is that any episode which is not mentioned in VR and which is found in other places - in an attempt to show supremacy to some other Deva - is to be treated as worthless and not pramana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
