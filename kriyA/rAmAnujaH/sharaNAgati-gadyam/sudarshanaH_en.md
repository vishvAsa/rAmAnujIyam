INTRODUCTION 
I am glad that I am able to edit and publish English Translations of some very useful Religious and Philosophical works in my Ubhaya Vedanta Grantha Mala Series. The public know that the first volume of Vedanta Deepa by Sri Bhagavad Ramanuja has been published with translations. The second Volume is getting ready and will be published soon. Meanwhile, an English Translation of Saranaagati Gadya, one of the three Gadyas by the same Sri Ramanuja, is being published. The translations are by Sri K. Bhashyam who has found the leisure not only to study these works but also undertake the task of translating them. 
The ultimate goal of life is Moksha, the release of one's soul from the cycle of Samsaara. To attain this, there are two ways indicated by the Saastras, one Bhakti Yoga and the other Prapatti. By etiher of these means the Redemptive Grace of God can be secured. Bhakti Yoga is difficult to perform for ordinary mortals, for, it means constant one-pointed meditation of Brahmam to be practised by the Devotee during his whole life time, accompanied at the same time by the performance of the usual rites, sacrifices, etc. On the other hand, Prapatti is the absolute surrender of the Self to the Lord; it is comparatively more easy and can be performed by any person who has learnt about it from his Aacharya and is desirous of Moksha. In ancient times, as stated in Taittireeya Upanishad, "Etatvai Mahopanishadam Devaanaam Guhyam", Prapatti was kept as a close secret. Hence, in Brahmasutra, Prapatti is mentioned but not 
iv 
clearly. For the same reason, Sri Ramanuja also did not wish to refer to it explicitly in his Sri Bhashya and Geeta Bhashya. Whatever controversy there may be as to whether Sri Ramanuja advocated Prapatti in his other works, there is no doubt that he has unmistakably indicated in his Gadya Traya the path of Prapatti as a sure direct means to salvation. So, while other works of Sri Ramanuja are to be studied to learn from them exactly what are the Tatwa, and Purushaarta, but to know what is Hita it is necessary to complete the study by studying the Gadya Traya, for, it is only then we can understand Hita, (Prapatti) its nature and how it is to be performed. 
Saranaagati Gadya is in the form of a dialogue between Sri Ramanuja and Sri (Lakshmi) in the first instance, then between Sri Ramanuja and Naraayana. Tradition is that Sri Ramanuja performed Saranaagati in Srirangam before Lord Ranganatha and His Consort Sri (Lakshmi) when they were seated on an Aasthanam and that Sri (Lakshmi) and the Lord actually spoke to him and granted him his prayers as seen from the Saranaagati Gadya. 
To Sri Ramanuja, Iswara is a Personal God who has the Universe, Chit and Achit as His Body and is full of all and various beneficient qualities. It is appropriets therefore that, as is usual with him, Sri Ramanuja should in his Saranaagati Gadya, sing the glory or the beauty of His divine Personality, the brilliance of His wonderful ornaments, and the Mighty powers of His weapons. 
is also adored as the Consort of Sri (Lakshmi), Bhoo Devi and Neela Devi. He has also for His attendants Nityas, like Garuda and Vishvaksena, and the Muktas, in Vaikunta, the Blissful Abode of Sri Naraayana. 
V 
Saranaagati Gadya is the exposition of Dvaya Mantra which has come to us traditionally. This is the major Gadya, the other two Gadyas being supplementary. This work is one of great religious importance to the followers of Sri Ramanuja who believe in his philosophy of Visishtadvaita. 
There are more than one Commentary on this Gadya. The Commentary of Sri Sruta Prakasika Acharya (Sudarsana Bhatta) is taken for translation as it is a short one and is by an author respected equally by all sects of Sri Vaishnavas. 
Thanks are due to Sri Srinivasachariar, the Proprietor of the Liberty Press for the neat printing of the work and bringing it out in quick time.

(17) Then follow directions by the Lord as to how the Devotee should conduct himself or arrange to spend the rest of the days of his life. 
Du:kka and Vighna connote the same thing. The investigation into meaning of Dvaya and recitation of it are prescribed to avoid any attachment to 
47 
material things. If even for a minute, there is a vacant interval in this action, room will be given to the three kinds of afflictions. This mediation does not help as a means to Moksha; in fact, the mere utterance of Dvaya will do. This is however mentioned not as compulsory act to be performed but only as a way of spending the time fruitfully. 
Srirangam means not merely Srirangam but includes any place favoured by Gods and Godly 
men.

Kevalam: Even if the Jeeva does not do Dayaayeva-eva here indicates the implies that the knowledge gained during one's lifetime is to be compared to darkness.

however, he may (at the time of his death) be like a log of wood, a piece of stone, etc., yet Iswara will remember him and favour him with high spiritual knowledge when his soul rests in Him. The Finite soul enters on its journey towards Iswara by the light shown by Him. The word "Maam" refers to Iswara with His natural personality, resplendent that at that time the Jeeva is not disturbed by any form, His attributes and His Vibhutis. Eva indicates 
other thoughts.

Translation of Text 
(17) Thus relieved and not troubled by the obstructions in the least degree, which are the cause of wordly or divine griefs and sorrows, always uttering Dwaya Mantra with full understanding of its meaning and significance, you shall reside in Sriranga till the body falls to the ground (death). 
You will, by My Grace, attain true knowledge with no diminution of your capacities of consciousness of desires (to go to heaven) and shaking off easily this mortal coil (body) both physical and subtle, you will at once attain the privilege of constant and ever service (as stated above). 
Assurance by the Lord.

(18) Ma Te bhoot Atra Samsaya: These are words of assurance that what was said already is not mere words of consolation.

The assurance is for the whole world.

(Here Nigamanta Desika gives the solution in a different way-Gnana referred to here is the confirmation of that knowledge acquired Acharyas unimpaired.) 
Thus ends the commentary by Srutaprakaasika Acharya of Saranaagathi Gadya.
