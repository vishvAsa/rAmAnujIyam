INTRODUCTION 
I am glad that I am able to edit and publish English Translations of some very useful Religious and Philosophical works in my Ubhaya Vedanta Grantha Mala Series. The public know that the first volume of Vedanta Deepa by Sri Bhagavad Ramanuja has been published with translations. The second Volume is getting ready and will be published soon. Meanwhile, an English Translation of Saranaagati Gadya, one of the three Gadyas by the same Sri Ramanuja, is being published. The translations are by Sri K. Bhashyam who has found the leisure not only to study these works but also undertake the task of translating them. 
The ultimate goal of life is Moksha, the release of one's soul from the cycle of Samsaara. To attain this, there are two ways indicated by the Saastras, one Bhakti Yoga and the other Prapatti. By etiher of these means the Redemptive Grace of God can be secured. Bhakti Yoga is difficult to perform for ordinary mortals, for, it means constant one-pointed meditation of Brahmam to be practised by the Devotee during his whole life time, accompanied at the same time by the performance of the usual rites, sacrifices, etc. On the other hand, Prapatti is the absolute surrender of the Self to the Lord; it is comparatively more easy and can be performed by any person who has learnt about it from his Aacharya and is desirous of Moksha. In ancient times, as stated in Taittireeya Upanishad, "Etatvai Mahopanishadam Devaanaam Guhyam", Prapatti was kept as a close secret. Hence, in Brahmasutra, Prapatti is mentioned but not 
iv 
clearly. For the same reason, Sri Ramanuja also did not wish to refer to it explicitly in his Sri Bhashya and Geeta Bhashya. Whatever controversy there may be as to whether Sri Ramanuja advocated Prapatti in his other works, there is no doubt that he has unmistakably indicated in his Gadya Traya the path of Prapatti as a sure direct means to salvation. So, while other works of Sri Ramanuja are to be studied to learn from them exactly what are the Tatwa, and Purushaarta, but to know what is Hita it is necessary to complete the study by studying the Gadya Traya, for, it is only then we can understand Hita, (Prapatti) its nature and how it is to be performed. 
Saranaagati Gadya is in the form of a dialogue between Sri Ramanuja and Sri (Lakshmi) in the first instance, then between Sri Ramanuja and Naraayana. Tradition is that Sri Ramanuja performed Saranaagati in Srirangam before Lord Ranganatha and His Consort Sri (Lakshmi) when they were seated on an Aasthanam and that Sri (Lakshmi) and the Lord actually spoke to him and granted him his prayers as seen from the Saranaagati Gadya. 
To Sri Ramanuja, Iswara is a Personal God who has the Universe, Chit and Achit as His Body and is full of all and various beneficient qualities. It is appropriets therefore that, as is usual with him, Sri Ramanuja should in his Saranaagati Gadya, sing the glory or the beauty of His divine Personality, the brilliance of His wonderful ornaments, and the Mighty powers of His weapons. 
is also adored as the Consort of Sri (Lakshmi), Bhoo Devi and Neela Devi. He has also for His attendants Nityas, like Garuda and Vishvaksena, and the Muktas, in Vaikunta, the Blissful Abode of Sri Naraayana. 
V 
Saranaagati Gadya is the exposition of Dvaya Mantra which has come to us traditionally. This is the major Gadya, the other two Gadyas being supplementary. This work is one of great religious importance to the followers of Sri Ramanuja who believe in his philosophy of Visishtadvaita. 
There are more than one Commentary on this Gadya. The Commentary of Sri Sruta Prakasika Acharya (Sudarsana Bhatta) is taken for translation as it is a short one and is by an author respected equally by all sects of Sri Vaishnavas. 
Thanks are due to Sri Srinivasachariar, the Proprietor of the Liberty Press for the neat printing of the work and bringing it out in quick time.

(2) Pray Thee, bless my sincere and real Saranaagati at the Lotus Feet of Bhagavan so that it may become well and truly performed with all its angas (formalities) and be continued and without interruption till the goal of Purushaartha is reached. This with the object of securing for myself the privilege of the occupation of ever-service to the Lord. i.e. the satisfaction derived in all forms and kinds of service always suited to the conditions and circumstances of the moments and which is the result

of boundless intense devotion born out of the experience of enjoyment of the Lord that is, the unbounded limitless, unselfish love for no other end but that of service direct Him,-A love perfect, enjoyed fully in all His manifestations, not now but continuously with no interruption-This again promoted by the sincere one-pointed and ever intense Para Bhakti, (i.e. the desire for His Vision) Para Jnaana (direct perception of God) Parama Bhakti (the longing to have that perception continued for ever)-Bhakti at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.

Kalyaana Aikataana mean the sole abode of, and completely full of, all kinds of, Virtues. Besides, Kalyaana means also good not only to one's self but also to others. "Eka" excludes the possibility of being jada or inauspicious in any portion.

next twelve are peculiar as being useful for thegrant of salvation to the Devotees. 
Seela is where a superior has as his natural quality the quality of moving freely with the inferiors; when that is exercised for no selfish or other purpose, it is Sau-Seelya. That is to say, Iswara does not cause fear in the heart of the Devotees by his Iswaratva nor does he generate any feeling in them of undue hesitation to approch Him. by His superiority. 
Vaatsalya is the quality to find good even in Evil: Just as a cow fondles its new born dirty calf. This quality is one of the features of extreme

is not mentioned 
Maardava is the feeling of loss at any separation from the devotees, a feeling of apprehension when they are not present at any place. 
Aarjava denotes perfect correlation of mind, speech and body in action. So it is said "Rajubudhyat sarvam akhayatum upachakarme" 
"because 
of His artlessness He (Rama) began to narrate to Surpanaka all about Himself" Sauhaarda:-Ever wishing well of His Devotees :-Intent in doing good to them without caring for any return. Saamya is the quality which does not make differentiation on account of birth, conduct or character; making Himself easily available to them all and also rewarding. them, not minding any difference in the gifts offered

Audaarya:-with no feeling that any devotee has been over favoured or not satisfied with the favours granted. "Krishna felt indebted and remembered the debt when Drowpadi cried for help when being dishonoured :or with no feeling that favours are granted to a stranger, but is only as if to son who is entitled to the patrimony. Chaaturya-affording instant relief to his Devotees overlooking their faults just like a father. Rama peformed the Abhisheka to Vibhishana on the battlefield itself. Sthairya :-Firm determination not to abandon His Devotees. 
These twelve (qualities) are useful to Him for saving His Devotees. 
Then follow three qualities which go to help Him in punishing those who stand in the way of His protecting His Devotees. 
13 
"Dhairya"-Unshaken stand against foes who stand in the way of granting such protection; "jatajoota granthim drudhayathi "making fast the knot of the hair." "Saurya": Prowess to enter the enemy's camp as easily as if entering His own 
house. 
Paraakrama-power to vanquish foes after (at the entering their camp "Chinnam Bhinnam" time Rama's destroying Ravana's moola balam. 
Then are mentioned two qulities relating to enjoyment. Satyakaama denotes Iswara possessing of Nitya Vibhuti. [The word Kama has many mean ings.] Satya Sankalpa denotes Iswara possessing the worlds for his Leela i.e., sport or recreation. Thus possessing the two worlds for his Dominion. 
The next two qualities refer to the protective activities of the Lord apart from the 12 qualities already mentioned. 
Krititva is the state of satisfaction in having acceded to the prayers of the Devotees, therefore the word may mean One who is active, that is to say, He Himself does what the Devotees should have done "Aham smarami". "I think of him at the death of the devotee though he may not remember me." 
Kritaganata denotes 'I remember' i.e., remembering what has been done, but not what has to be Kritagna is one who done but left undone, or. 
14. 
remembers only the good act done, however small but not the faults, nor the return He is making to them. The word gana is used to denote that in the each of the qualities there are many (subvarieties) qualities contained in them. Such Gana's flood is 
Ogha". 
Mahaarnava is the Ocean. Virtues and and qualities have no permanent value unless they seek abode in Bhagavan; indeed, without such refuge, they have no value. 
Translation of Text 
(4) Thou art the Ocean unto which flow rivers of limitless excellent Virtues, all natural to Thee, and useful for the protection of the Devotees, such as, All knowledge, Mighty rulership of the worlds, Untiring virility; Power to act without any outside help; Kind disposition, like that of a cow to its calf. Affectionate tenderness; Gentleness; Truthfulness in Mind and speech and body, Friendliness, Feeling of Equality, Mercifulnesss, Generosity, Quickness to respond to the miseries of Sweetness, Nobility, the Devotees, Firmness in Thy resolve to protect Devotees, Undaunted courage to bring succour to them, Courage to fight for the Devotees: Ability to fight the enemies within their own one camp; ing Thine will ever fuifilled, Having Thy commands irresistable, Thy Deeds fully executed-Always remembering with gratitude (even a little worship) done to Thee.

COMMENTARY 
5. Then Ramanuja goes on to describe the adornments and ornaments, on the Divya Vigraha of Iswara. 
Vividha means different kinds of ornaments such as Kataka, Makuta; Vichitra denotes varieties in each kind of ornaments. 
Anantaascharya-Excellent beyond any limit. Niravada is used to denote, "flawlessness for the purpose of contemplation". When starting contemplating on the Divine Form, naturally the vision of His ornaments comes on prominently before our mental eyes. The quality of "Niratisaya Sugandhatvam" distinguishes these ornaments from the ordinary or common variety. For the Sruti says "He is all sweet smelling and all Rasa" 
Makuta means the central piece in the head coronet in which the most precious stone is imbedded. or it may mean the Crown, itself. Compare "NaAkundali-Na-Amakuti " "No one in Ayodhya without Kundala and Makuta" Kireeta Rupa is Makuta, i.e., the head ornament. Divya means divine, not16

ear ornaments, necklaces and neck ornaments, garlands, shoulder-bracelets and bracelets in the hands, Sri Vatsa and Kaustubha, pearl garlands, waistlets, lace cloths, gold waist band and leg ornaments and others precious and innumerable.

"Achintya Sakti" Each weapon has the power to do the work of all the weapons as stated in Ramayana about the arrow of works generally done with the help of a crowbar, a Rama.

COMMENTARY 
7. Then comes a passage which describes the splendid attributes of Sri and ends by saying that Iswara is the Lord of such a Sri. (The meaning of the passage has been already given). He is also the Lord of Bhoo Devi and Neelaa Devi who are also possessed of the splendid qualities similar to these mentioned in connection with Sri. 
This is 
indicated by the word "Evambhoota." The two Devis are mentioned separately as they occupy not the same status as Sri, but are her "Seshabhootas." Accordingly, it is said in Sri Guna Ratnakosa that Laxshmi pleases Her Lord by means of Bhoo and Neela whom she considers as her organs breast, hands, feet and look.

COMMENTARY 
(8) Next, come " Parijanas": His Attendants. Swaroopa denotes a form distinguished from forms similar to, and different from forms of other kinds. "Sthiti" explains that things exist only so long as they are fixed in their places. It is here intended to point out the difference between Nitya Siddhas and the Samsaarins-While the former understand and know the wishes of the Lord by their own perceptive powers, the Samsaarins do not know of His wishes and desires but act only as the Lord wills. The word "Bheda" qualifies the words Swaroopa, Sthiti, and Pravritti and shows the difference between them; it may also show that these activities etc., of Samsaarins are different from

those of Nityas. Again, the word may be taken together as Swachachanda Anuvrtti - Swaroopa Sthiti-Pravrttaya: (That is to say, the Nityas are 
ti Pravy distinct and are to be distinguished from Samsaarins, for, they act understanding intuitively the wishes of 
the Lord. 
Nitya-Niravadya distinguishes Nityas from the 
Muktas. 
"Kriya" here means Service to the Lord. Aiswarya means the control and direction of the activities of the body, organs, etc.-Sesha-asana is Vishvaksena, (for he is the eater of the remains of the food of the Lord) Cf. Aalvandaar's Stotra Ratna, "the Eater of the food left over after thy eating." 
Naanaavidha:of different kinds-Holding the Umbrella, whisking the Chaamara, serving as sandals or as a seat or the holding the betel spittoon are the varieties of such services. In each of the services. the devotees employed are so many and innumerable. Parichaarikaa is used keeping in mind females like Vimala (one of the lady attendants who whisk chaamaras.) 
Translation of Text 
(8) Thou possessest also innumerable followers and servants, male and female, to minister to Thy wants and comforts, waiting at Thine Feet, whose form, existence and actions are due to Thine will: they are, Aadisesha, Vishvaksena, Garuda, who are endowed with host of beneficient virtues, Unperishing.

(9) Then follows a description of Vaikuntha 15 and describes Naraayana as the Lord of Vaikuntha. 
In the next passage, "Parama Yogi Vangmanasa Aparicchedya Swarupa Swabhaava" may be taken by itself as in the vocative case qualifying Paramatman'; or as qualifying Vaikuntha as described in Vaikuntha Gadya. In the former case, ParamaSwarupa means His natural and supreme attribute of Rulership. In the latter, the word Swarupa will signify a structure.

COMMENTARY 
(II) The following eight Namas (names) are used as proofs to show that He is possessed of all the qualities mentioned before as natural to Him. By Satyakaama, the Lord is denoted as possessing Nitya Vibhooti. Satya Sankalpa denotes the possession of Leelaa Vibhooti and also that He is the nimitta Kaarana (creative cause). To show that He is also the Upaadaana Kaarana, the name parabrahmabhoota is used. To show that though He is the Upaadaana Kaarana, He is not affected by any infirmities of material things, the next Nama, Purushothama is used. To dispel any doubt that may be created as to how, being the Upadaana Kaarana, He can be said to be separate and distinct from Prakarti, the next Name Mahaa Vibhooti is used reminding us of the harmonising sruti. That is to say, He has the Vibhootis as His Body. To denote that they both Iswara and Sri. are jointly Masters, the word 'Sriman' follows. 
The next name Naaraayana "is used to convey the same sense in some detail (i.e., Iswara and Sri). That He is not affected by the infirmities attaching to the Vibhooti, has been already expressed in some what general terms by the word "Mahaa Vibhooti. The Nirukti of the word (Naaraayana) Naraat Jaataani. Tatvaani Naraani Iti Tato Vidu:" Again, to show 
24 
explicitly and authoritatively the existance of NityaVibhooti, the name Vikunta Naatha is used. The root meaning of Vaikuntha is as follows: 
The root Kuthi=gati-Pratighaata means "to obstruct know ledge" The obstructions are caused by Karma. Vi= without; Vikuntha= without karma or obstruction to knowledge. obstructed by karma and such like impediments are Souls whose knowledge is not called Vikuntha. The place where they reside is 
called Vai-kunta. 
Thus far, the nature of the Brahman and Its attributes and qualities, appertaining to both of the aspects of being the Upaaya (the means to an end) and Upeya the goal to reach, have been adumb- 
rated.

Having thus far described the very many virtues and qualities of Iswara, now Bagavad Ramanuja goes on to show that the phala of possession of these qualities, That is to invite surrender (Saranagati.) He starts with "Anaolochita-Visesha which denotes that there is no distinction on account of caste, conduct or character. Loka includes all worlds and the living beings therein. He is Pranataarti Hara, i.e. capable of removing all calamities of His Devotees, because of the possession by Him of all the virtuous powers and qualities. This is the name Its special mention of Varadaraja of Kaanchi. here by Sri Ramanuja may be in remembrance of the special grace shown to him by Kanchi Varada and his consort who appeared as hunter and huntress to help him when he was deserted by the Yadava The mention may also be Prakaasa in a forest. due to the special grace shown to him by Varada of Kanchi genarally. The attribute Aasritavaatsalya is useful to Him in his activities (of protecting his Devotees). The quality of "vaatsalya" (affection as that of cow to its calf) is specially mentioned as Ramanuja believes that it is a quality most noticeably radiant in Him. The next following Nama Anavarata" etc., is mentioned by Sri Ramanuja as he believed that it is the opinion of Iswara that

The ultimate meaning is that even "Nivrtti" ("inaction ") is also His doing or His will. To remove any doubt that may arise as to why Iswara should save the soul of Jeeva, the words "Asesha Chit-Achit " "Even the prayer to Thee by the Jeeva that he should be saved is also due to Thy Will; "Why then shouldst thou sustain and allow them to grow?"

COMMENTARY 
(12) Calling himself as a Ananya Sarana (helpless person). 
Ramanuja makes the surrender. "Twat Paadaaravindya yugalam" points out that He is possessed of all various virtues and qualities mentioned before and hence the person to be approached. 
Aravinda because such a prayer at His feet is a pleasant performance. Yugala can be said to be explanatory of the dual (Charanow) mentioned in Dvaya Mantra. Aham. I who am a great sinner who has committed an Ocean of sins." 
- Prapadye I surrender. Upto this the first portion of Dvaya Mantra has been expounded. 
Then Sri Ramanuja goes on to give the full meaning of Ananya Sarana: 
Saranam Aham 
30 
Prapadye by referring to quotations and passages from the Puranaas. 
In the sloka quoted, all the things mentioned up to and including "Guroon" (i.e., the first portion). denote Upaayas (means to attain the goal.) case Daara (wife) is included in the first portion as In this she is the Means as well as Bhogya. The second half of the Sloka mentions other things such as Ratna, etc., as they are things considered to be valuable in this world. Then, in the next sloka beginning with "Sarva" is set out the Upaayas to be used in the Paraloka (in the next world) and the gains to be obtained through them. 
The word 
"Akshara" 
denotes Kaivalyam (enjoyment by the soul of itself only). By the words Loka Vikraanta and Vibho are denoted His qualities of easy accessibility and All 
Mightiness. 
Then the word "Saranam" is expounded in the next Sloka. Bhagavaan is the real father and relation in the The Sloka conveys the idea that matter of protection, etc., and to show that he does the function fully and better than the natural, father and others; The words "Twam Eva" is repeated at intervals. The idea that "Not only is He my father but He is also the father of the whole world" is sought to be conveyed by the Sloka beginning with "Pita Asi." In the matter of protection of Jivas, there is none to equal Him or to excel Him. It is so even in the matter of easy accessibility. Apramatima Prabhaava pictures His All Mightiness. 
31 
Then, Prapatti (meaning conveyed by Prapadye) is expounded. " Isam Idyam" conveys the idea that there is no "Isa" (Lord) above Him and He alone is 
to be worshipped. Compare the Santi passage "None to Lord over Him, the Highest is His glory." Parents, etc., forgive and bear with us But Iswara because of their respective relationship. does it because of His eternal connection with us in all manner of ways (not merely relationship by birth); He is bound to forgive us. What is Prapatti? Prapatti is the Supreme Faith in the Lord which culminates in solicitation to Him of our desires or it may mean the Prayer preceded by the supreme Faith.

COMMENTARY 
(13) Sri Ramanuja then starts to expound the later portion of "Dvaya". In doing so, he first deals with the meaning of the word "Nama: "I salute". The word Nama: is taken first and even before the passage "Srimate Naraayanaya" (though it is earlier in sequence), because Good follows only after driving out the Evil. "Srimate Naraayanaya" indicates the attainment of Good, and Destruction of Evil. 
"Nama," 
Then Ramanuja prays for purification from his sins. Anaadikaala Pravrtta (collected over a long period of endless Time) is the reason for its being "Ananta." The earlier word Ananta is an adjective qualifying all kinds of Apachaara (offences-the doing of prohibited acts and omitting to do acts pres cribed, in general. The second Ananta qualifies Apachaara. After referring to offences generally in the first instance, Sri Ramanuja goes on to specific offences, in the passage beginning with "Bhagavat." Bhagavat Apachaara is an offence like, one committed by Sisupala. Bhaagavat Apachaaras are offences towards His devotees (may be in the matter of money and other causes) or it may be taken to mean that offences towards His Devotees are offences against Him also. That is denoted by Bhaagavat Apachaara. Offences against the Bhaktas or Bhaghavatas are Bhaagavata-Apachaara. [In the commentary the words Bhaaghavata Apachaara is repeated twice. But it makes the sense obscure and illogical. Hence one 
3 
34 
of them is to be omitted. Otherwise offence against Bhagvan will be taken an offence against Bhaagavatas also.] 
Asahya Apachaara means offences against Acharya or 
it may mean offences committed against Bhaagavatas, believing that they are not His Devotees or it may mean the belief that the idols in the temples are not any different from ordinary play-dolls. By the word "Naanaa Vidha' is denoted that there are many sub-divisions in each of these various offences. The word "Sarva" is used to include all and every offences in its fold. Karmas have the capacity to make a man unfit for Vaidic ceremonies, to make him suffer the consequence of his sinful acts and to create in him a tendency to commit similar sinful acts. With a view not to exclude any of these categories, the word 
"Aseshatha :" is used. 
Next, Ramanuja prays to the Lord that He should forgive acts in form meritorious, but really sinful that may be committed by him. 
Vipareetha Gnaana relating to Atman: this would consist of the knowledge that the Aatman and the world are entities that are not subject to control but independent entities by themselves, or that they are subject to the control of Gods other than Naraayana, or the idea that the things (which are really under the control of Bhagvaan) are under one's own service 
35 
or control. Even a meritorious act, if it arises out of the feeling that one's soul is an independent entity is one of perversity. When a man performs an act solely out of a desire for gain to himself or to his family, even that meritorious act as being the worship of Bhagvaan, Bhaagavatas, or other Gods, it is said to be Vipareetha Vrtta contained in the word 'Asesha.'

COMMENTARY 
(14) Then, Sri Ramanuja goes on to describe the Moolaprakrti in the passage beginning with the word "Madeeya." Karma is called "Anaadi" on account of the Nyaaya "Tree from the seed (Beejaankura Nyaaya) "Tirodhaana Kareem" reminds us of the passage in Geeta-"Gunamaya Samaavrta." Vipareeta Gnana is that knowledge which comprehends Deha (Body) as Aatman (Soul). The passage "Dehendriya" connotes that the Prakrti manifests itself as Bhogya (Enjoyable thing) and Bhogopakarana (means for enjoyment). The 
"Daiveem" denotes that all these are for His word 
recreative purposes. Daasabhootam is adjective qualifying "maam". (The other reading is Daasabhuta: This is adopted by Sri Desika and he renders an interesting meaning to the words. Dasabhuta: denotes OM; Saranagatosmi denotes Nama :-Tavasmi Dasa: denotes Naaraayanaya). 
The first half of Dvayamantra is contained in its essence in Saranaagatosmi and the second half is in Tavaasmi Dasa: 
44 
37 
Vaktaaram: Even an utterance of the words Bhava saranam" gets one to salvation. Cf. "Bhava Saranam itieerayanti.”

COMMENTARY 
(15) Next, Sri Ramanuja prays for the securing of the desired gains which are implied with the dative (fourth) case from Srimate Naarayanaaya contained in the Dvaya. Then a question arises as to whether in the case of a Prapanna (i.e., a person who has completely surrendered himself as a helpless person to Iswara), Parabhakti, Parag-nana and Paramabhakti are necessary steps for salvation. Because it is the accepted doctrine that by Prapatti alone Moksha is secured to the surrenderer. How then does Sri Ramanuja pray for Parabhakti etc.? Prapatti stands in the place of Parabhakti. In the previous passage "Maam Taaraya". Sri Ramanuja has made the surrender and so he is a Prapanna. So he does not intensely pray for Parabhatki but, only for the other two, i.e., Para Gnana and Paramabhakti so as to be obtainable by him during his life time here. Even in the case of a person engaged in Bhaktiyoga, these two are obtained by him during the time his connection with the body continues. They are, however, Upaaya (means) for salvation in his case. But in the case of a Prapanna they are not Upaayas but really gains (Upey as) obtainable just 
39 
before Moksha. Of these two, Paragnana is prayed for in the first instance by the passage Teshaam, etc. And by the next passage beginning with "Purusha: Sa Para:, Parama Bhakti is prayed for 
and not Para Bhakti. 
The words "Sthaana Traya" are used to denote that the passages are found disconnected and in three different places in Geeta. In the next sentence, he again refers to Parabhakti, Paragnana, Paramabhakti, but they are qualities attained by a Released soul only in the stage of Moksha. That is why, the qualification 
pointed natural qualification-a stage not attainable 
in Samsaara). 
Next, Sri Ramanuja prays for that feeling of satisfaction arising out of the conscious experience of the Lord and also for its consequence i.e., various services to the Lord. (The next passage has been Seshataika Rati Roopa" is a already explained).

(iii) He obtains that supreme devotion to Me." Make me also endowed with constant Para Bhakti, Para Gnaana and Parama Bhakati. I pray that I may become Thy servant in ever constant service to Thee-I having acquired the experience of the Lord, i.e., full and clear and constant, highly desired, having no other object in view and produced by Para Bhakti, Para Gnana and Parama Bhakti, a

COMMENTARY 
el foid b 16. In response to the prayer, the Lord grants the prayer by the passage following:-"Yevamboota 
99 
Heenopi" conveys in substance the purport of the meaning of the first paada of the Charama Sloka. "Sarva Dharmaan Parityajya." Avaklupta means injuncted by the Saastra-"Samasta Vastu Viheena: means though not qualified by having performed, Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga and not acquired the subsidiary qualifications mentioned in the Geeta (Amaanitvam). "Viheena" conveys the idea that the Devottee had already given up Dharmas as implied in the Tyaaga in the Charama all Sloka. By the words. the "Ananta, etc.", it is sought. to convey the idea ingrained in the preposition "Pari" in Parityaga.' (Pari 
(Pari means completely.) In fact, the helpless Prapanna is unable to perform the three Yogas on account of his sinful Karmas and hence he has to give them up on account of this inability (to do it even in future). 
Karmas which are enemies of salvation are so These sinful heinous in character that he has lost all hopes of being able to perform the Yogas at any time in future. All this is conveyed by the prefix 'Pari.' Yetat Kaarya Kaarana Bhoota' denotes the Nyaya "The tree from the seed", each is Kaarya and Kaarana also. The adjective Vipareeta is in connection with "Ahankaara" with the object of not excluding all Ahankaras, but some varieties of them (e.g. that body is the soul) For, some kinds of 
43- 
Ahankara are not objectionable. (e.g., 'I am Brahman i.e. that Brahman is the indweller in Me.") This is also found in the Sruti (Atha Atha: Ahankaara 
" 
Aadesa :) 
The nature 
"Vimoodha Aatma Swabhava:" of Atman (Finite Soul) is service-ship. This is hidden from the Jeeva. "Ubhaya Karya Karana"Ubhaya denotes both sin and ignorance "Sukha Duhkha Taddhetu: All undesirable things not fit to be enjoyed. 
"Gnaana Sankocha: Ignorance of the true natureof Paramaatman and Jeevatman. This ignorance and the enjoyment of material objects are the obstructions (Vighna) stated later on. Ena Kenaapi Prakaarena: Whether as a person in a hurry to attain Moksha (Aartha) or one who is willing to delay (till the end of his life). 'Kevalam' - Only by My Grace and Mercy" irrespective of the feeling of anxiety or repentance of the Devotee." Eva in Madeeyaya eva is used to emphasise that only His Grace is responsible for the Devotee's salvation and Madeeya connotes that He does not need any other agency for showing His Grace. Visthaara: is used to show that when the Devotee gets the direct vision of God, it is not only of some of His qualities but all. 
of them. 
Thus far 
the word Narayana has been expounded. Next follows the description of the-status of Jeeva, at the Moksha - a status which is 
44 
naturally his. - in the passage beginning with Aparoksha. 
Manniyaamyatva includes both ideas 
about Paramaatman-pervasiveness and support by Him Cf. "Oh! Gargi, Sun, Moon, etc. are supported by Him and controlled by Him." Thus, the idea that Jeevaatman is independant (of Him) is excluded. 
Madeka Anubhava: Generally, a man follows actions which are in conformity with the status in which he considers himself to be. Here, when a devotee thinks himself to be the servant of the Lord, he engages himself in worship, etc., and thus enjoys Him. Eka emphasises that the service is directed only to Him and not to anything or anybody else. 
Mad daasya eka Priya: Service to Him is pleasurable because the Lord is so High that He deserves all the worship that one can give Him. Eka emphasises that the Devotee will not desire for anything else but service. 
Evam Bhutosi is in answer to a question arising in the mind of the Devotee (Sri Ramanuja) as to when should the state of service start? The past tense denotes that you have already become one or can become at any time desired. This is the great boon and gain.

COMMENTARY

(17) Then follow directions by the Lord as to how the Devotee should conduct himself or arrange to spend the rest of the days of his life. 
Du:kka and Vighna connote the same thing. The investigation into meaning of Dvaya and recitation of it are prescribed to avoid any attachment to

material things. If even for a minute, there is a vacant interval in this action, room will be given to the three kinds of afflictions. This mediation does not help as a means to Moksha; in fact, the mere utterance of Dvaya will do. This is however mentioned not as compulsory act to be performed but only as a way of spending the time fruitfully. 
Srirangam means not merely Srirangam but includes any place favoured by Gods and Godly 
men.

Kevalam: Even if the Jeeva does not do Dayaayeva-eva here indicates the implies that the knowledge gained during one's lifetime is to be compared to darkness.

however, he may (at the time of his death) be like a log of wood, a piece of stone, etc., yet Iswara will remember him and favour him with high spiritual knowledge when his soul rests in Him. The Finite soul enters on its journey towards Iswara by the light shown by Him. The word "Maam" refers to Iswara with His natural personality, resplendent that at that time the Jeeva is not disturbed by any form, His attributes and His Vibhutis. Eva indicates 
other thoughts.

Translation of Text 
(17) Thus relieved and not troubled by the obstructions in the least degree, which are the cause of wordly or divine griefs and sorrows, always uttering Dwaya Mantra with full understanding of its meaning and significance, you shall reside in Sriranga till the body falls to the ground (death). 
You will, by My Grace, attain true knowledge with no diminution of your capacities of consciousness of desires (to go to heaven) and shaking off easily this mortal coil (body) both physical and subtle, you will at once attain the privilege of constant and ever service (as stated above). 
Assurance by the Lord.
