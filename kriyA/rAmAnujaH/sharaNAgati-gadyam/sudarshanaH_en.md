INTRODUCTION 
I am glad that I am able to edit and publish English Translations of some very useful Religious and Philosophical works in my Ubhaya Vedanta Grantha Mala Series. The public know that the first volume of Vedanta Deepa by Sri Bhagavad Ramanuja has been published with translations. The second Volume is getting ready and will be published soon. Meanwhile, an English Translation of Saranaagati Gadya, one of the three Gadyas by the same Sri Ramanuja, is being published. The translations are by Sri K. Bhashyam who has found the leisure not only to study these works but also undertake the task of translating them. 
The ultimate goal of life is Moksha, the release of one's soul from the cycle of Samsaara. To attain this, there are two ways indicated by the Saastras, one Bhakti Yoga and the other Prapatti. By etiher of these means the Redemptive Grace of God can be secured. Bhakti Yoga is difficult to perform for ordinary mortals, for, it means constant one-pointed meditation of Brahmam to be practised by the Devotee during his whole life time, accompanied at the same time by the performance of the usual rites, sacrifices, etc. On the other hand, Prapatti is the absolute surrender of the Self to the Lord; it is comparatively more easy and can be performed by any person who has learnt about it from his Aacharya and is desirous of Moksha. In ancient times, as stated in Taittireeya Upanishad, "Etatvai Mahopanishadam Devaanaam Guhyam", Prapatti was kept as a close secret. Hence, in Brahmasutra, Prapatti is mentioned but not 
iv 
clearly. For the same reason, Sri Ramanuja also did not wish to refer to it explicitly in his Sri Bhashya and Geeta Bhashya. Whatever controversy there may be as to whether Sri Ramanuja advocated Prapatti in his other works, there is no doubt that he has unmistakably indicated in his Gadya Traya the path of Prapatti as a sure direct means to salvation. So, while other works of Sri Ramanuja are to be studied to learn from them exactly what are the Tatwa, and Purushaarta, but to know what is Hita it is necessary to complete the study by studying the Gadya Traya, for, it is only then we can understand Hita, (Prapatti) its nature and how it is to be performed. 
Saranaagati Gadya is in the form of a dialogue between Sri Ramanuja and Sri (Lakshmi) in the first instance, then between Sri Ramanuja and Naraayana. Tradition is that Sri Ramanuja performed Saranaagati in Srirangam before Lord Ranganatha and His Consort Sri (Lakshmi) when they were seated on an Aasthanam and that Sri (Lakshmi) and the Lord actually spoke to him and granted him his prayers as seen from the Saranaagati Gadya. 
To Sri Ramanuja, Iswara is a Personal God who has the Universe, Chit and Achit as His Body and is full of all and various beneficient qualities. It is appropriets therefore that, as is usual with him, Sri Ramanuja should in his Saranaagati Gadya, sing the glory or the beauty of His divine Personality, the brilliance of His wonderful ornaments, and the Mighty powers of His weapons. 
is also adored as the Consort of Sri (Lakshmi), Bhoo Devi and Neela Devi. He has also for His attendants Nityas, like Garuda and Vishvaksena, and the Muktas, in Vaikunta, the Blissful Abode of Sri Naraayana. 
V 
Saranaagati Gadya is the exposition of Dvaya Mantra which has come to us traditionally. This is the major Gadya, the other two Gadyas being supplementary. This work is one of great religious importance to the followers of Sri Ramanuja who believe in his philosophy of Visishtadvaita. 
There are more than one Commentary on this Gadya. The Commentary of Sri Sruta Prakasika Acharya (Sudarsana Bhatta) is taken for translation as it is a short one and is by an author respected equally by all sects of Sri Vaishnavas. 
Thanks are due to Sri Srinivasachariar, the Proprietor of the Liberty Press for the neat printing of the work and bringing it out in quick time.

COMMENTARY 
(12) Calling himself as a Ananya Sarana (helpless person). 
Ramanuja makes the surrender. "Twat Paadaaravindya yugalam" points out that He is possessed of all various virtues and qualities mentioned before and hence the person to be approached. 
Aravinda because such a prayer at His feet is a pleasant performance. Yugala can be said to be explanatory of the dual (Charanow) mentioned in Dvaya Mantra. Aham. I who am a great sinner who has committed an Ocean of sins." 
- Prapadye I surrender. Upto this the first portion of Dvaya Mantra has been expounded. 
Then Sri Ramanuja goes on to give the full meaning of Ananya Sarana: 
Saranam Aham 
30 
Prapadye by referring to quotations and passages from the Puranaas. 
In the sloka quoted, all the things mentioned up to and including "Guroon" (i.e., the first portion). denote Upaayas (means to attain the goal.) case Daara (wife) is included in the first portion as In this she is the Means as well as Bhogya. The second half of the Sloka mentions other things such as Ratna, etc., as they are things considered to be valuable in this world. Then, in the next sloka beginning with "Sarva" is set out the Upaayas to be used in the Paraloka (in the next world) and the gains to be obtained through them. 
The word 
"Akshara" 
denotes Kaivalyam (enjoyment by the soul of itself only). By the words Loka Vikraanta and Vibho are denoted His qualities of easy accessibility and All 
Mightiness. 
Then the word "Saranam" is expounded in the next Sloka. Bhagavaan is the real father and relation in the The Sloka conveys the idea that matter of protection, etc., and to show that he does the function fully and better than the natural, father and others; The words "Twam Eva" is repeated at intervals. The idea that "Not only is He my father but He is also the father of the whole world" is sought to be conveyed by the Sloka beginning with "Pita Asi." In the matter of protection of Jivas, there is none to equal Him or to excel Him. It is so even in the matter of easy accessibility. Apramatima Prabhaava pictures His All Mightiness. 
31 
Then, Prapatti (meaning conveyed by Prapadye) is expounded. " Isam Idyam" conveys the idea that there is no "Isa" (Lord) above Him and He alone is 
to be worshipped. Compare the Santi passage "None to Lord over Him, the Highest is His glory." Parents, etc., forgive and bear with us But Iswara because of their respective relationship. does it because of His eternal connection with us in all manner of ways (not merely relationship by birth); He is bound to forgive us. What is Prapatti? Prapatti is the Supreme Faith in the Lord which culminates in solicitation to Him of our desires or it may mean the Prayer preceded by the supreme Faith.

(12) I seek Thy protection and surrender Myself unto Thine Lotus Feet. (Saranaagati) 
Athra Dvayam:-(So far, Dvaya Mantra has been expounded). The explanation of this sentence 
with Mantra. 
(a) (I do prostrate before Thee)-Renouncing my father, mother, wife, children, relatives, friends, even my Teacher, precious stones, wealth and goods, my field, my house, etc. all desires, and actions relating to them, 
Kaivalya I prostrate at 
as well as Thine feet 
which bestrode the Three worlds. 
32 
(b) Oh Lord! I surrender Myself unto Thee. Thou alone art My Mother, My Father, Thou art My relations; even My Teacher Thou alone art. So also my learning, my wealth. Indeed Thou art My All. 
(c) Oh! God of Gods, Thou art the Father of the Worlds moving and unmoving, worshipped by the World. 
Thou art greater than the greatest. There is no one bigger than Thee in all these Three Oh! Thou of Matchless 
Worlds. 
Glory. 
(d) Therefore prostrating before Thee, with my body bent in adoration, I pray unto Thee, the adorable Master. Thou art like a Father unto a son, like a Friend unto a Friend, affectionate as to a Dear Person. Thou alone canst save me. 
Prayer for Purification.

COMMENTARY 
(13) Sri Ramanuja then starts to expound the later portion of "Dvaya". In doing so, he first deals with the meaning of the word "Nama: "I salute". The word Nama: is taken first and even before the passage "Srimate Naraayanaya" (though it is earlier in sequence), because Good follows only after driving out the Evil. "Srimate Naraayanaya" indicates the attainment of Good, and Destruction of Evil. 
"Nama," 
Then Ramanuja prays for purification from his sins. Anaadikaala Pravrtta (collected over a long period of endless Time) is the reason for its being "Ananta." The earlier word Ananta is an adjective qualifying all kinds of Apachaara (offences-the doing of prohibited acts and omitting to do acts pres cribed, in general. The second Ananta qualifies Apachaara. After referring to offences generally in the first instance, Sri Ramanuja goes on to specific offences, in the passage beginning with "Bhagavat." Bhagavat Apachaara is an offence like, one committed by Sisupala. Bhaagavat Apachaaras are offences towards His devotees (may be in the matter of money and other causes) or it may be taken to mean that offences towards His Devotees are offences against Him also. That is denoted by Bhaagavat Apachaara. Offences against the Bhaktas or Bhaghavatas are Bhaagavata-Apachaara. [In the commentary the words Bhaaghavata Apachaara is repeated twice. But it makes the sense obscure and illogical. Hence one 
3 
34 
of them is to be omitted. Otherwise offence against Bhagvan will be taken an offence against Bhaagavatas also.] 
Asahya Apachaara means offences against Acharya or 
it may mean offences committed against Bhaagavatas, believing that they are not His Devotees or it may mean the belief that the idols in the temples are not any different from ordinary play-dolls. By the word "Naanaa Vidha' is denoted that there are many sub-divisions in each of these various offences. The word "Sarva" is used to include all and every offences in its fold. Karmas have the capacity to make a man unfit for Vaidic ceremonies, to make him suffer the consequence of his sinful acts and to create in him a tendency to commit similar sinful acts. With a view not to exclude any of these categories, the word 
"Aseshatha :" is used. 
Next, Ramanuja prays to the Lord that He should forgive acts in form meritorious, but really sinful that may be committed by him. 
Vipareetha Gnaana relating to Atman: this would consist of the knowledge that the Aatman and the world are entities that are not subject to control but independent entities by themselves, or that they are subject to the control of Gods other than Naraayana, or the idea that the things (which are really under the control of Bhagvaan) are under one's own service 
35 
or control. Even a meritorious act, if it arises out of the feeling that one's soul is an independent entity is one of perversity. When a man performs an act solely out of a desire for gain to himself or to his family, even that meritorious act as being the worship of Bhagvaan, Bhaagavatas, or other Gods, it is said to be Vipareetha Vrtta contained in the word 'Asesha.' 
66 
Adyapi Vartamaanam."-Even though clearly instructed by Acharya and though the knowledge gained is comprehensive, because of the inherited tendencies, which cannot be shaken off) Vipareetha Gnaana) and Vipareetha Vritta do result. Hence 
46 
Adyaapi."

13. Pray grant me forgiveness without reserve of All my sins without exception, sins of various kinds, committed, being committed or to be committed-endless and beginningless, i.e. commission of acts forbidden, omission of acts enjoined to be performed, all committed by mind, or tongue or body towards Thee or Thine Devotees - unforgivable (so many in number) whether connected with acts started or not so started. Forgive me, Oh, Lord, my (poor) knowledge or action, however,

COMMENTARY 
(14) Then, Sri Ramanuja goes on to describe the Moolaprakrti in the passage beginning with the word "Madeeya." Karma is called "Anaadi" on account of the Nyaaya "Tree from the seed (Beejaankura Nyaaya) "Tirodhaana Kareem" reminds us of the passage in Geeta-"Gunamaya Samaavrta." Vipareeta Gnana is that knowledge which comprehends Deha (Body) as Aatman (Soul). The passage "Dehendriya" connotes that the Prakrti manifests itself as Bhogya (Enjoyable thing) and Bhogopakarana (means for enjoyment). The 
"Daiveem" denotes that all these are for His word 
recreative purposes. Daasabhootam is adjective qualifying "maam". (The other reading is Daasabhuta: This is adopted by Sri Desika and he renders an interesting meaning to the words. Dasabhuta: denotes OM; Saranagatosmi denotes Nama :-Tavasmi Dasa: denotes Naaraayanaya). 
The first half of Dvayamantra is contained in its essence in Saranaagatosmi and the second half is in Tavaasmi Dasa: 
44 
37 
Vaktaaram: Even an utterance of the words Bhava saranam" gets one to salvation. Cf. "Bhava Saranam itieerayanti.”

14. “I am Thy servant. I have surrendered myself_unto Thee. Help me, Thy servant, Oh Lord! to cross over Thy Moolaprakruti, of Three Gunas which flow like a current of the beginningless and endless Karma which hides from my vision, Thy natural, Form and produces in me a perverted knowledge about Thee and a sense of (false) satisfaction in me in the enjoyment of material matters existing (in the world) in all manner of forms, subtle and gross-in body, senses and objects of enjoyment. 
The Desired End-Eternal service.

COMMENTARY 
(15) Next, Sri Ramanuja prays for the securing of the desired gains which are implied with the dative (fourth) case from Srimate Naarayanaaya contained in the Dvaya. Then a question arises as to whether in the case of a Prapanna (i.e., a person who has completely surrendered himself as a helpless person to Iswara), Parabhakti, Parag-nana and Paramabhakti are necessary steps for salvation. Because it is the accepted doctrine that by Prapatti alone Moksha is secured to the surrenderer. How then does Sri Ramanuja pray for Parabhakti etc.? Prapatti stands in the place of Parabhakti. In the previous passage "Maam Taaraya". Sri Ramanuja has made the surrender and so he is a Prapanna. So he does not intensely pray for Parabhatki but, only for the other two, i.e., Para Gnana and Paramabhakti so as to be obtainable by him during his life time here. Even in the case of a person engaged in Bhaktiyoga, these two are obtained by him during the time his connection with the body continues. They are, however, Upaaya (means) for salvation in his case. But in the case of a Prapanna they are not Upaayas but really gains (Upey as) obtainable just 
39 
before Moksha. Of these two, Paragnana is prayed for in the first instance by the passage Teshaam, etc. And by the next passage beginning with "Purusha: Sa Para:, Parama Bhakti is prayed for 
and not Para Bhakti. 
The words "Sthaana Traya" are used to denote that the passages are found disconnected and in three different places in Geeta. In the next sentence, he again refers to Parabhakti, Paragnana, Paramabhakti, but they are qualities attained by a Released soul only in the stage of Moksha. That is why, the qualification 
pointed natural qualification-a stage not attainable 
in Samsaara). 
Next, Sri Ramanuja prays for that feeling of satisfaction arising out of the conscious experience of the Lord and also for its consequence i.e., various services to the Lord. (The next passage has been Seshataika Rati Roopa" is a already explained). 
Bahuvrihi compound.

15. Please, Oh! Lord, favour me and make me a Gnaani like the one described in the following 
three Slokas: 
Slokas: 
(a) Of them (the four classes of Devotees), 
the one who is steadfast and concen-

trates his devotion on me only is above the others-for to him I am excessively dear: So also is he dear to Me. 
(b) Indeed, I consider: All these (the four classes) are generous; but of them the Gnani the wise is My Inner Self. He, being steadfast in his mind, rests on Me, as the Supreme Goal. 
(c) At the end of many births, a man having realised that Vasudeva is the All, comes 
to Me, He is Mahatma, rare indeed to find. 
Also make me endowed with Parabhakti described in the following three passages in Bhaghavad Geeta :- 
(i) Oh Arjuna! That Supreme (Person is attainable only by Bhakti undistracted. (ii) He is to be attained only by Bhakti which seeks no other benefit than that of attaining Him. 
(iii) He obtains that supreme devotion to Me." Make me also endowed with constant Para Bhakti, Para Gnaana and Parama Bhakati. I pray that I may become Thy servant in ever constant service to Thee-I having acquired the experience of the Lord, i.e., full and clear and constant, highly desired, having no other object in view and produced by Para Bhakti, Para Gnana and Parama Bhakti, a 
41 
service which is the result of great urge to perform services of all forms suited to the conditions and circumstances of the moment, which are produced by the unlimited love and devotion to Thee arising out of the experience as stated above.

COMMENTARY 
el foid b 16. In response to the prayer, the Lord grants the prayer by the passage following:-"Yevamboota 
99 
Heenopi" conveys in substance the purport of the meaning of the first paada of the Charama Sloka. "Sarva Dharmaan Parityajya." Avaklupta means injuncted by the Saastra-"Samasta Vastu Viheena: means though not qualified by having performed, Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga and not acquired the subsidiary qualifications mentioned in the Geeta (Amaanitvam). "Viheena" conveys the idea that the Devottee had already given up Dharmas as implied in the Tyaaga in the Charama all Sloka. By the words. the "Ananta, etc.", it is sought. to convey the idea ingrained in the preposition "Pari" in Parityaga.' (Pari 
(Pari means completely.) In fact, the helpless Prapanna is unable to perform the three Yogas on account of his sinful Karmas and hence he has to give them up on account of this inability (to do it even in future). 
Karmas which are enemies of salvation are so These sinful heinous in character that he has lost all hopes of being able to perform the Yogas at any time in future. All this is conveyed by the prefix 'Pari.' Yetat Kaarya Kaarana Bhoota' denotes the Nyaya "The tree from the seed", each is Kaarya and Kaarana also. The adjective Vipareeta is in connection with "Ahankaara" with the object of not excluding all Ahankaras, but some varieties of them (e.g. that body is the soul) For, some kinds of 
43- 
Ahankara are not objectionable. (e.g., 'I am Brahman i.e. that Brahman is the indweller in Me.") This is also found in the Sruti (Atha Atha: Ahankaara 
" 
Aadesa :) 
The nature 
"Vimoodha Aatma Swabhava:" of Atman (Finite Soul) is service-ship. This is hidden from the Jeeva. "Ubhaya Karya Karana"Ubhaya denotes both sin and ignorance "Sukha Duhkha Taddhetu: All undesirable things not fit to be enjoyed. 
"Gnaana Sankocha: Ignorance of the true natureof Paramaatman and Jeevatman. This ignorance and the enjoyment of material objects are the obstructions (Vighna) stated later on. Ena Kenaapi Prakaarena: Whether as a person in a hurry to attain Moksha (Aartha) or one who is willing to delay (till the end of his life). 'Kevalam' - Only by My Grace and Mercy" irrespective of the feeling of anxiety or repentance of the Devotee." Eva in Madeeyaya eva is used to emphasise that only His Grace is responsible for the Devotee's salvation and Madeeya connotes that He does not need any other agency for showing His Grace. Visthaara: is used to show that when the Devotee gets the direct vision of God, it is not only of some of His qualities but all. 
of them. 
Thus far 
the word Narayana has been expounded. Next follows the description of the-status of Jeeva, at the Moksha - a status which is 
44 
naturally his. - in the passage beginning with Aparoksha. 
Manniyaamyatva includes both ideas 
about Paramaatman-pervasiveness and support by Him Cf. "Oh! Gargi, Sun, Moon, etc. are supported by Him and controlled by Him." Thus, the idea that Jeevaatman is independant (of Him) is excluded. 
Madeka Anubhava: Generally, a man follows actions which are in conformity with the status in which he considers himself to be. Here, when a devotee thinks himself to be the servant of the Lord, he engages himself in worship, etc., and thus enjoys Him. Eka emphasises that the service is directed only to Him and not to anything or anybody else. 
Mad daasya eka Priya: Service to Him is pleasurable because the Lord is so High that He deserves all the worship that one can give Him. Eka emphasises that the Devotee will not desire for anything else but service. 
Evam Bhutosi is in answer to a question arising in the mind of the Devotee (Sri Ramanuja) as to when should the state of service start? The past tense denotes that you have already become one or can become at any time desired. This is the great boon and gain.

16. [Then the Lord answers the prayer and says to the Devotee :] 
"You may not have all the requisite qualifications for attaining the state of being in my such 
45 
service; you may even be beset with sins which stand in your way of attaining My service); you may have sinned grievously against Me or against My people (Bhaagavatas) or committed unto me extremely grievous wrongs unforgivable. Your a disposition which disposition may be such hides Me from your vision i.e., Ahankara which is the cause and result of the above sins. You may be even affected by begginingless and perverted impressions and tendencies (inherited from previous births) which are the cause and result of your sins and of Ahankaara. You may be connected with Prakrti You may be even set (the cause of the above All). upon by obstructions to Para Bhakti, Para Gnana and Parama Bhakti-a Bhakti constant and onepointed towards the lotus like feet of Mine which obstructions consist of limited knowledge due to the enjoyment of external (material) things which are the objects of pleasure and sorrow or of neither; caused by bodily organs and outside objects (of the earth or divine), all these due to connection with Prakrti. 
However, you have somehow or other uttered the words of Mantra, Dvaya. By My mere Mercy, you will be freed completely from the obstructions to Para Bhakti, Para Gnana, Parama Bhakti and You will also by My Grace obtain Para Bhakti, Para Gnana and Parama Bhakti and be favoured with the direct vision of Me, My Form My attributes, My Vibhootis and also of Moolaprakriti You will also realise which is My Playground.

COMMENTARY

(17) Then follow directions by the Lord as to how the Devotee should conduct himself or arrange to spend the rest of the days of his life. 
Du:kka and Vighna connote the same thing. The investigation into meaning of Dvaya and recitation of it are prescribed to avoid any attachment to 
47 
material things. If even for a minute, there is a vacant interval in this action, room will be given to the three kinds of afflictions. This mediation does not help as a means to Moksha; in fact, the mere utterance of Dvaya will do. This is however mentioned not as compulsory act to be performed but only as a way of spending the time fruitfully. 
Srirangam means not merely Srirangam but includes any place favoured by Gods and Godly 
men.

anything. 
Kevalam: Even if the Jeeva does not do Dayaayeva-eva here indicates the implies that the knowledge gained during one's lifetime is to be compared to darkness.

however, he may (at the time of his death) be like a log of wood, a piece of stone, etc., yet Iswara will remember him and favour him with high spiritual knowledge when his soul rests in Him. The Finite soul enters on its journey towards Iswara by the light shown by Him. The word "Maam" refers to Iswara with His natural personality, resplendent that at that time the Jeeva is not disturbed by any form, His attributes and His Vibhutis. Eva indicates 
other thoughts.

Translation of Text 
(17) Thus relieved and not troubled by the obstructions in the least degree, which are the cause of wordly or divine griefs and sorrows, always uttering Dwaya Mantra with full understanding of its meaning and significance, you shall reside in Sriranga till the body falls to the ground (death). 
You will, by My Grace, attain true knowledge with no diminution of your capacities of consciousness of desires (to go to heaven) and shaking off easily this mortal coil (body) both physical and subtle, you will at once attain the privilege of constant and ever service (as stated above). 
Assurance by the Lord.
