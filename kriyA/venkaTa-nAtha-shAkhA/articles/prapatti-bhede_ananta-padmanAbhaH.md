namO nArAyaNa!

 

Dear devotees,

 

One of the main differences between the Vadakalai and Thenkalai SampradAyams is their exposition on the nature of Prapatti. This article dwells upon this issue.

 

Earlier, there has been many articles about Bhakti and Prapatti that were posted to the net. Please refer the archives and also SrI Ahobila Muth Website (Link : About SrI VaishNavam). --------

 

## ThennAchArya SampradAya

 

According to SrI PuttUr SwAmi of ThennAchArya SampradAyam, the classification of muktAs according to his sampradAyam is as follows (*) :

 

1. Those who aspire for jIvAtma-anubhavam and completes jn~yAna yOga, attains Kaivalyam (for eternity), which is in the outskirts of SrI VaikuNTham. This is a type of moksha.

2. Those who perform upAsana as prescribed in Upanishads aspire for ParamAtma-anubhavam and obtain it at SrI VaikuNTham. But, they also have " selfishness " in the sense of 

(i) wishing to attain bliss for themselves ;  
(ii) Importantly, " wishing to enjoy ParamAtma " .


As a result, they obtain only the type of moksha which is predominant with " SwArtha-Mixed ParamAtmAnubhavam " (SMP) (ie. With " I " -ness still present in their ParamAtma anubhavam). For them, Kainkaryam (Service) is restricted to be secondrary in comparison with their SMP.

Basically, performing bhakti-yOga (ie.upAsana) is contradictory to the nature of a jIvAtma. Thus, those who adopt it still have ahankAra. As a result, in SrI VaikuNTham, the best type of moksha is not obtained by them.

3. Those who perform Prapatti as a upAya, has got rid of most of Swa-pravrutti (ie. Indulgence by oneself for obtaining moksham). In other words, their Swa-pravrutti is not as worse as that of those who perform bhakti yOga. As a result, they obtain the type of moksha at SrI VaikuNTham to perform SwArtha-mixed Kainkaryam (Existence of " I " -ness while performing kainkaryam), which is the overflow of ParamAtma-anubhavam. For them the performance of kainkaryam is primary and ParamAtma-anubhavam becomes secondrary.

 

Thus, SrIman nArAyaNa makes Swagata-sweekAram for those who adopt prapatti with the thinking of " Prapatti " as an upAya and He awards only the above state of moksha.

 

This is to make a point that Prapatti as followed by Vadagalai sampradAyam will result only in this state of moksham and that they can't obtain superior state of moksham.

 

Note: The anga GOptrutva varanam is a prayer towards SrIman nArAyaNa for attaining moksham / eternal kainkaryam. This is done during the act of Bhara-nyAsam and hence is different from other angAs which can be cultivated earlier in a general way. Ofcourse, the wish to attain moksha has to be there prior to obtaining moksham.

 

ThennAchAryas do not accept the " positive " act of prayer from the side of jIvAtmas to be the superior mode of achieving moksha.

 

4. Those who do not indulge in performing any act for their moksham are those who have got rid of Swa-pravrutti. They are aware that performce of acts such as upAsana etc is contradictory to their essential nature as jIvAtma.

 

These superior-most mumukshus leave also their SvArthabaram unto Lord. They are firm that, " what I perform is not upAya; What Lord Himself performs is the upAya " . For such mumukshus, Lord by His nirhEtuka kripa performs the Paragata SweekAram and awards them the superior-most state of moksha, which is the performance of ParArtha kainkaryam (kainkaryam for the sake of enjoyment of ParamAtma only). -------

 

(*) : Reference : Discussion in 18th Chapter of Bhagavad GIta - Commentary by SrI PuttUr SwAmi in Tamil - It reflects Bhagavad RAmAnuja's GIta BhAshyam and SwAmi DESikan's TAtparya Candrika; Ofcourse he states the views of ThennAchAryas when it is in conflict with SwAmi DESikan's exposition. ------------

 

Thus there are four types of muktas accordingly and this has some resemblance with the theory of Dwaitins, who uphold difference in the anubhavam(aananda) of muktas based upon the extent to which they have performed bhakti prior to obtaining moksham. ------------------------

 

 

Corresponding Viewpoints of Vadakalai AchAryas : **************************************************

 

1. Kaivalyam is not eternal. It is in the material world itself. Those who have attained kaivalyam can later attain SrI VaikuNTham.

 

2. The upAya viz. bhakti-yOga(upAsana) is not contradictory to the essential nature of a jIvAtma. Since there are strict injunctions in SAstras to perform it (eg: KrishNa commanding Arjuna says " mAm bhajasva " to attain Him ie. commanding him to perform bhakti-yOga) as a means to attain Lord, a mumushu with such adhikAram (qualification) should neccessarily perform bhakti-yOga.

 

Many rishis of great fame like Sage VasishTha, Sage ParAsara, Sage VyAsa, Sage Suka and others have adopted bhakti-yOga and they are not persons with dull-intellect to perform a upAya contradictory to their essential nature. Even grest SrI VaishNavas like SrI Thiruk-kurugaik-kAvalappan has performed upAsana to obtain moksham, after having duly obtained such upadEsam from SrI NAthamuni, who obtained such upadEsam on the secrets of " Bhakti-yOga " from NammAzhwAr. These great SrI VaishNava AchAryas wouldn't have performed such upadEsam and practiced such acts which are contradictory to one's own essential nature.

 

Actually, the mumukshu performing bhakti-yOga neccessarily observes SAtvIka-tyAga as explained well in Bhagavad GIta. They can't be accused of being the possesors of ahankAra. Though they perform a positive act, it is performed alongwith Kartrutva tyAga (a component of sAtvIka tyAga) and thereby they are still renunciants of the performance of the act. Similarly so are the implications of mamata and phala tyAga components.

 

3. Similarly, Prapatti is also a SAstric injunction ( " SaraNam Vraja " ) to be performed compulsarily by a mumukshu of certain qualification, in-order to obtain moksham. They also can't be accussed of having ahankAra and mamakAra since they also perform SAtvIka tyAga. Such Prapannas knows that the fruit of such Prapatti is for SrIman nArAyaNa only (with themselves obtaining the bliss, due to being a chEtana with knowledge and feelings, as per Lord's arrangement only). They know that SrIman nArAyaNa is their only (Siddha)upAya and Prapatti by itself is not the upAya.

 

4. Prapatti as a positive act (Essentiality of Goptrutva varanam etc) + How is this Prapatti a vyAja + Discussion on SahEtuka Kripa can be referred for the corresponding views of Vadagalai AchAryas to the fourth type of mukta/mumukshu considered by Then-AchAryas. In essence, this theory of ThennAchAryAs not acceptable for them as one leading to moksham.

 

5. There are no distinctions amongst muktAs. All muktAs are entitled to have selfless ParamAtma-anubhavam and its overflow namely selfless Kainkaryam (Divine Service) unto SrIman nArAyaNa. --

 

These theories of ThennAchAryas do not have support from SrI BhAshya, GIta BhAshya and even SaraNAgaThi Gadyam for that matter wherein a positive act is performed by EmperumAnAr. But, the reply from them is that in the midst of VEdAntins, BhAshyakArar has written about Bhakti (in SrI BhAshya and GIta BhAshya) to please them ; and SaraNAgathi Gadyam is for pleasing those who are suffering in general (incapable of understanding many esoteric concepts of nirhEtuka kripa of PerumAL etc, but have attained good enough knowledge to grasp general concepts on Prapatti). This reply stems from the ThennAchArya SrI PeriavAccAn PiLLai's (PVP) " Paranda Rahasyam " , wherein he states " arthOpacandanam gadyam bhAshyam tu para-ranjanam " \< arthasya-upacandanam => Speaking Very nice words etc unto those who are suffering, just for the sake of pleasing them\>. Thus, according to ThennAchAryas, their theory on the fourth type of mukta is a topmost rahasya and it is seen in sampradAya anushtAnam also for them.

 

Interestingly, DoDDayAchArya alias VAdUla SrInivAsAchArya alias MahAchArya, a great ThennAchArya of the 16th Century has supposed to have accepted Prapatti as NyAsa Vidya, with all the five angAs etc as explained by SwAmi DESikan. It is told that, during SamASrayanam, he would make the disciple recite NammAzhwAr's " akalakillEn ... " pAsuram in front of Divya Dampati after he recites it etc. This way, he used to perform " Ukti nishta " Prapatti it seems. 

Some Vadagalai AchAryas feel that, the above theories of ThennAchAryas (as presented by SrI PuttUr SwAmi now) has come into existence only within the recent three or four centuries. In the book " YatIndra Mata DIpikA " by SrInivAsAchArya, the ardent disciple of SrI DoDDayAchArya, the section on Prapatti lists the five angAs and eqautes it to a Brahma Vidya as a positive act and leaves the rest of the information to be attained through kAlakshEpam, since Prapatti is a rahasya. YatIndra-Mata - DIpika is an excellent manual on ViSishtAdvaita, following mainly SwAmi DESikan's NyAya-SiddhAnjanam. By the way, SrI DoDDAyAchArya was an ardent devotee of SwAmi DESikan and is highly evident through many sources. He wrote " SwAmi DESikan Vaibhava PrakASika " which describes very well the various life-events and achievements of SwAmi DESikan. SrI DoDDayAchArya pays very high tributes to SwAmi DESikan in it. He also wrote many works in VEdAnta, notable of which the famous CaNDamAruta, as a commentary to SatadUshaNi.

 

Also, SrI PVP in some places of his commentaries advocates anushtAnam of Prapatti as a positive act to be performed.

 

Anyway, the current theories as presented above, is one way of reconcilation by the thennAchAryas, based on the writings of their pUrvAchAryas. But, there are some Vadakalai AchAryas like SrI MadhurAntakam VeerarAghavAchArya of the last century who has written many articles to make the point that SrI - PiLLailOkAchArya has not advocated a concept of Prapatti which is different to that of SwAmi DESikan's. These Vadakalai AchAryas state that while PiLLai-lOkAchArya mostly wrote on a certain mode of Prapatti (BhAgavatha Nishta), SwAmi DESikan has given the whole picture about it. This is another way of re-concilation. SrI MadhurAntakam SwAmi has also written on the interpretations of certain key texts of PiLLai-lOkAchArya and has re-conciled it with that of SwAmi DESikan's advocation of Prapatti. But, it is to be noted that this re-concilation does not accept the fourth type of attaining moksham (as stated above) viz. NirhEtUka Kripa by itself is the means without any positive act as a Prapatti anushtAnam.
