- भस्मना तिर्यक्-पुण्ड्रम् (just the ease of application!)

## Depictions
Perumal idols with such namams are very late. They are found on pillars and walls first. As well as in the sculptures in the walls and pillars. Such depictions show both namams. Hampi temples show the state of affairs before 1565 and we see both types in these temples..  

Pre 1500 depictions are seen in hazara Rama temple and vitthala temple in hampi where you find majority of proper vdk  namams in former and majority of tk namams in latter. But the other style namams are also seen in both places.

(Claim made by people like Sri Vaishnava Sri Krishnamachari that tk namam is the only original one is proven wrong by this fact.) 

### viShNu
There developed some smriti vachanas prohibiting shUnya-lalATa for all people, due to which viShNu images too started sporting a decoration.

Originally viShNu idols did not wear the 3-line Urdhva-puNDra - which would make sense since they symbolize his foot and so befit vaiShNavas instead. 

Perumal idols with such are very late.

#### Old depictions
The diamond urdhvapundra used on devaraja of kanchi during one utsavam was apparently donated by achyutaraya as per inscription, iirc. So, the usage of such urdhvapundra on bhagavan Himself is definitely more than 5 centuries old -  No doubt. We see such usages in hampi as well. But not in the chola and pandya murtis.

We see puNDras in lepakshi Dashavatara murals for instance (eg. Mahavishnu with abhayahasta) - These are datable to Achyutaraya if not slightly before- so post-1526, perhaps?

And interestingly there seems to have been another variant of the Urdhvapundra for men, which today is restricted to women. Eg. Lakshminarayana and Kurmavatara 

i.e. the little shvetapundra crescent below (the diamondish mark for Kurma is usually made of javvadu or kasturi)


## sampradAya-difference
सच्-चरित्र-रक्षायां वेदान्त-देशिकेन दक्षिण-कलार्येषु प्रसिद्धं शूलष्पुण्ड्रम् नोल्लिखितम् इति बहवः।

I would go to the extent of saying that both types were in use and did not even determine which sampradaya you belonged to - till late 1600s perhaps. That one type became an identification for a particular sampradaya and another for the other sampradaya - is a later innovation. There is no evidence for a pundra difference based on sampradaya in the 1400s/1500s.
