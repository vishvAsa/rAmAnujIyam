      <description>&lt;p&gt;ONE The Rule Sanctioning Itinerant Asceticism&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OM-at the time of meditation we hear it proclaim Him! Vedas, that string of texts, are a ladder to reach Him! He is Hari! In Him we take refuge!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Śrī is His wife, the eagle is His banner. Lord of the Universe, victory is yours! Once He took up the ascetic emblem, and from heretic assaults He protected the Threefold Veda.1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There appears to have been a myth according to which Visnu, incarnate as a triple-staffed Brahmin renouncer, once protected the vedic tradition from heretical attacks; cf. Ch. 6.303. The historical reference, if any, of this statement, however, is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TWO Age of Eligibility of a Candidate for Itinerant Asceticism 1. We will now consider the candidate&amp;rsquo;s age of eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Renunciation after Marriage 2. According to one opinion, itinerant asceticism is permitted only after a person has lived as a forest hermit and not while a person is still a vedic student. 3. This view is supported by the following vedic texts: After giving to the teacher a gift that would please him, let him not cut off his line of offspring. [TU 1.11.1] 4. At his very birth a Brahmin [is born with three debts]. [TS 6.3.10.5: see Ch 1.14] Procreation is the very foundation. Spinning out well the thread of progeny, a man becomes free from his debt to the forefathers. [MNU 525] 5. Manu, likewise, states: Only after paying his three debts should a man set his mind on renunciation. Should he take to renunciation without paying them, he will fall.2 [MDH 6.35] 6. Yajnavalkya says: No one but a man who has studied the Veda, recited silent prayers, fathered sons, distributed food, established the sacred fire, and offered sacrifices according to his ability may set his mind on renunciation. [YDh 3.57] 1. The term &amp;ldquo;moksa&amp;rdquo; (lit., &amp;ldquo;liberation&amp;rdquo;) in Manu and in Yajnavalkya (below, Ch. 2.6) refers specifically to the renunciatory mode that constitutes the fourth order of life devoted exclusively to the pursuit of personal liberation. For an extensive discussion of the meaning of this term in Manu, see Olivelle 1993, 137-42.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THREE Examination of the Insignia 1. Now we will examine the insignia, which are of two types: the external and the bodily. The bodily insignia consist of the sacrificial string and having the head completely shaved or wearing just a topknot, while the external insignia are the staff, the water pot, and other such items. With reference to external insignia we employ the term &amp;ldquo;article.&amp;ldquo;1 Bodily Insignia 2. I will first describe the bodily insignia. Vasistha states: and: Wearing a sacrificial string and carrying a water pot in his hand. . . . [VaDh 10,31] Let him be shaven-headed, free from pride and anger, and without possessions. [VaDh 10.6] 3. Yama: He should always sleep on the bare ground and never stay long in the same place. His head shaven and always living in the wilderness, let him turn his mind incessantly to knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FOUR The Procedure of Renunciation 1. I will now describe the procedure of renunciation, explaining at the outset the procedure given by Saunaka. In the course of this explanation I will point out at the appropriate places certain indispensable details of the procedure not found in Saunaka but given elsewhere. 2. Katyayana gives its preliminary rites: People living outside the orders of life should perform four Krechra penances, while those living within an order should perform a single Krechra penance. In this manner one becomes fit for renunciation. On the twelfth day of the bright fortnight or on the full moon, he should announce his intention2 and get his head shaved. He should then perform the Śrāddha oblations-first to the gods, second to the seers, third to the divine beings, fourth to the male ancestors, fifth to the female ancestors, sixth to human beings, seventh to the elements, and eighth to the self.3 3. Blessed Vasistha the Elder says the same thing, with an identical statement beginning with &amp;ldquo;on the full moon day.&amp;ldquo;4 4. Saunaka states: 1. Those living outside the four orders of life are people such as bachelors who have completed their Vedic studentship and widowers. Four Krechra penances constitute what is technically known as a Prajapatya penance (see MDh 11.211; YDh 3.319). It consists of taking one meal a day for six days-a morning meal the first three days and an evening meal the second-eating what is received unasked during the next three days, and fasting during the last three. See GDh 26.1-5; ApDh 1.27.7; BDh 2.2.38; 4.5.6. A single Krechra penance is a quarter of the Prājāpatya, that is, doing the same four austerities for only one day each. Such a penance is called padakṛechra (&amp;ldquo;quarter penance&amp;rdquo;) at YDh 3.318. Regarding the &amp;ldquo;hot penance&amp;rdquo; (taptakṛechra) that some sources prescribe here, see Ch. 10.44 n. 9, and my translation of Ypra 6.2-3n.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FIVE Principal Activities 1. Next I will discuss the principal activities of ascetics. 2. In this connection, Uśanas writes: There are two kinds of vedic students, according to the scriptures: the temporary and the permanent; and likewise, two kinds of hermits: those who take their wives with them and those who leave their wives behind. 3. Mendicants likewise are of two types: mendicant renouncers and renouncers who abandon vedic rites; while there are numerous divisions of householders, such as Sālīna.&amp;rsquo; 4. Manu has declared only a twofold division of people belonging to the four orders of life. Out of these, listen now to the description of a mendicant renouncer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SIX Daily Practices 1. I describe next the daily practices of ascetics. If someone needs to find out about a practice that is not dealt with here, he should gather it from the corresponding practice of vedic students, following the rule that &amp;ldquo;when they do not run counter to the specific requirements of a particular order of life, these duties of vedic students apply also to people in other orders&amp;rdquo; [GDh 3.10]. When something is not found even there, one should gather it from the practices of householders. 2. Accordingly, the Blessed Vyasa states: When they are not mutually exclusive, all the practices of every order of life are applicable to every other order of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEVEN Proper Conduct 1. Now I will explain the rules of proper conduct. Manu writes in this connection: A sage should live without fire or house and enter a village to obtain food. He should remain disinterested, not acquisitive, and mentally composed. [MDh 6.43] 2. A begging bowl, dwelling at the foot of a tree, ragged clothes, a solitary life, and equanimity toward all-these are the marks of a renouncer.1 [MDh 6.44] 3. Let him long neither for death nor for life and await his appointed time, as a servant awaits his wages. [MDh 6.45] 4. He should place his foot on the ground after determining its purity by inspection. He should drink water that has been purified with a cloth strainer. He should speak words that are pure because true. And he should conduct himself with a pure heart. [MDh 6.46] 5. Let him bear insults patiently and never treat anyone with contempt. Let him, moreover, never quarrel with anyone just for the sake of this body. [MDh 6.47] 6. Toward a man who is angry at him let him not show anger in return; let him say kind words to those who revile him. In connection with any of the seven doors,2 moreover, let him not speak an untrue word. [MDh 6.48] 7. Finding joy in activities pertaining to his inner self, he should sit in meditation, free from concerns and desires, and go about alone during the day for the sake of bodily comforts.3 [MDh 6.49] 1. Manu uses the term moksa (lit., &amp;ldquo;liberation&amp;rdquo;) as a technical term for the order of life (aśrama) devoted to liberation, namely renunciation (see Ch. 2.5). The term &amp;ldquo;mukta&amp;rdquo; (lit., &amp;ldquo;liberated&amp;rdquo;) thus refers to one who has renounced. The most appropriate translations of these two terms, therefore, are &amp;ldquo;renunciation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;renouncer.&amp;rdquo; For a more detailed discussion of Manu&amp;rsquo;s use of this term, see Olivelle 1993, 137-42.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EIGHT Rules on Insignia and Related Penances 1. Now I will explain the rules on insignia, such as shaving, as well as the penances associated with them. In this connection, Saunaka writes: He should have himself shaved at the junctures between seasons, without cutting his topknot or shaving the hair of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Devala: The lunar day that falls between the fourteenth day of the bright lunar halfmonth and the first day of the dark half-month should be regarded as the juncture between two seasons. A person should have himself shaved on that day.1 3. Likhita: On every full-moon day falling at the juncture between seasons, except when it occurs during the four months of the rainy season, an ascetic should have his head shaved without cutting his topknot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NINE Wandering and Rain Residence 1. I will explain next the wandering and residence of ascetics. On this point, Gautama remarks: He should be celibate and keep a fixed residence during the rains. (GDh 3.11-12] 2. Medhātithi: He is seen in one place in the morning, at another place at noon, and at yet another at sunset; like the sun, he should remain without a home and free from attachment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TEN Penances 1. Now I will describe the penances. Vayu writes on this subject: Penances should be performed both for sins committed unintentionally and for sins deliberately committed. Even here others make the following observations 2. Sins, one should know, are of three kinds: sins committed by word, thought, and deed. Spread across day and night, they burn the people here. 3. Neither rites nor life lasts long-this is the highest truth the Veda teaches. So, while one is still alive, one should practice penances without any delay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ELEVEN The Procedure of an Ascetic&amp;rsquo;s Funeral 1. I will now describe the procedure of an ascetic&amp;rsquo;s funeral. In connection with this, Bodhāyana states: I will describe the complete procedure of an ascetic&amp;rsquo;s funeral. After purifying himself by taking a bath, a householder should perform the funeral of an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He should decorate the corpse with perfumes and garlands and place it on a bier. He should carry it toward the east or the north accompanied by the shouts of victory and the sound of drums and take it to a pure place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
