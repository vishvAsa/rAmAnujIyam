title = "17 Brahmotsavam or Car Festival"

+++
The Brahmotsavam ceremony in a temple is usually performed during a particular month, and this varies with the locality. For example the Brahmotsavam at Conjeeveram and Lakshmipuram (near Kuppam) is celebrated on the same day. It is performed during the month of Vaikasi every year. In this month the festival days are fixed with reference to the avabhrtasnanam or Tirtavāri day.

At Conjeeveram and Lakshmipuram the tīrtavari day is the "Sravanam", i.e., the day on which this star is predominant. This day is usually the ninth day of the festival.

In other words the festival is begun nine days prior to the Śravanam.

Utsavams are performed to God occasionally and also periodically.

The avabhṛtasnānam day may be fixed according to the nakshatra It may be fixed Oft "Śravanam," "Rohini" or "Punarvasu" It may be on the day on which pratishtha was done, or on the birthday of the Raja, It is also done on the Maha sankramaṇam day.

Utsavams may last any number of days from one to thirty days. If it lasts one to five days no dhvajārōhaṇam ceremony is performed. If the utsavam lasts longer and is from five days to thirty days then dhvajarohaṇam ceremony is performed.

Vishnu's Brahmotsavam should not run concurrently with that of any other deity. If the utsavam of any other deity has already commenced, the Vishnu utsavam may be begun subsequently. The utsavam of any other deity should not be begun after the beginning of the Vishnu utsavam and before its close.

The utsavam begins with the ankurarpaṇam ceremony. According to strict rules the ankurārpanam ceremony should be done at least a week before the beginning of the Brahmotsavam. But in practice, at the present time, the ankurarpaṇam ceremony is performed on the day just previous to the beginning of the utsavam. In fact the utsavam is begun with the performance of this ceremony.

The details of the ankurarpanam ceremony are the same as are described under the Diksha and Pratishtha ceremonies.

On the ankurārpaṇam day kaṅkanams are tied on to the berams (utsava Vigrahas)

and the Acharyas who take part in the worship of God The wrist thread has to be prepared by twisting five or seven threads. After twisting it it is placed along with a coconut, betel leaves, nuts on a settle of rice. Usually one thread is used for a person, and the coconuts should be equal in number to the number of threads or kankaṇams.

Then flowers, coconuts, plantains and betel with nuts are carried in procession round the prakāram once and these things are placed in front of the deity. During the procession, chatram and chamaram should be taken and "Śakunasūtra" is chanted. Vadyams are also sounded. Towards the close of the procession the wrist threads, coconuts and other things carried are kept down. The wrist threads are usually deposited on coconuts, one thread on each coconut and these coconuts are placed by the side of a settle of paddy or rice. The wrist threads and other articles should be placed by the side of God.

Punyāham is done and with this holy punyaham water the kankaṇams are sprinkled repeating the astramantra. The lower end of the thread is held down by the thumb and its neighbour of the left hand and with the fingers of the right hand the thread is smeared with sandal paste. Then placing the thread on the cocoanut, Ananta is avahanamed and upacharams are done to him.

The wrist threads or rakshais are purified by chanting the astramantra eight times.

The first śloka of the Jitante stotra is also repeated. Then the wrist thread is taken and it is tied to the wrist of the right hand of the male God (Vigraha). Then repeating the "Śrī sūktam" the wrist thread is tied to the left wrist of the Goddess. After tying the kankaṇams to God and Goddess the Archaka ties it on his right hand to the wrist.

Then the Archaka does nivedanam and upacharams to God. Lastly he offers śayanam to God. This offering of sayanam is usually done as in Pratishtha.

The selection of the Rtviks or persons to help the Acharya in the worship of God is done on the ankurārpaṇam day, during the night, [[१५६]]

The preparation of dhvajam (flag) for hoisting up on the pole (dhvajastambham) is usually done on the ankurārpaṇam day only. The dhvajam or the flag to be hoisted should be strictly speaking, ten yards long and five yards broad. The least is the length of the mūla beram (fixed idol in the temple) and the door way near the mūlavar.

The dhvajam should never be less than the height of the door way near the mūla vigraha.

The cloth is folded into four folds and the upper and the lower folds are left free and a figure of Garuda should be drawn in the middle (२nd and ३rd parts).

The colours in which the figure of Garuda is to be written is as follows:-spaṭikam, śonitam, pitam, dhūmram, raktambujiyam, pingalam, dhuhinam and brahmaraletam are the colours. An umbrella is to be drawn over the head, two chamaras on the two side and a lotus flower below the feet have to be drawn.

Below the lotus is to be drawn the pūrṇakumbham. By the sides of the kumbham paligais with seedlings should be drawn. Two lamps also are drawn, one on each side. The figure of Garuda has to be ready on the ankurarpaṇam dav.

The commencement of the utsavam.-God is roused from sleep by repeating the mantras "Uttishṭeti" and Sakuna Sūktam. God is then put on a palanquin or any seat repeating the mantra "Idam Vishnur vichakrame" and is taken round the prakaram in procession. Then God is seated in the mandapam. In the mandapam nine kalaśams are placed and tirumanjanam or snapanam is carried out in the usual way. Sometimes २०-A [[१५७]]
[[१५२]]

a kūrcha is made to represent God and then it is bathed instead of the image of God.

This is done often to save time, trouble and expense.

The Garuda dhvajam is taken out this day. It is placed near the dhvajastambham and then nivedanams and upacharams are done to the flag of Garuda. Repeating the mantra "Suparnositi " the flag is hoisted on the top of the flag staff in front of the door of the temple. After hoisting the flag the mantra "Khagēśa mala" is repeated Prayers are offered to Garuda that he should be present throughout the period of the utsavam. To Indra and the eight devatās of the eight cardinal points bali of pongal is offered. Every day during the festival Aradhanam is done to the flag-staff and the digdevatās.

The flag-staff should be between one hundred talams and the height a little more than that of the temple. It may be seventy talans or manāngulas. On the day on which the utsavam begins this flag-staff is sprinkled with punyaham water and water from the other kalaśams established and kept at the base of the flag-staff. Usually the flag-staff has some structure round it at the base, and also some structures near it.

Towards the close of the day arrangements are done for going through the bheritadanam ceremony (drum beating ceremony). When it is dark in the evening the utsava bēram is seated close to the flag-staff and to the south of it. Chakrat Azhvār is placed just in front of the dhvajastambham. Then Aradhanam and nivedanam to God are performed. Afterwards close to the dhvajam and in front of the God (the utsava bēram) paddy is spread on the ground. On this spread of paddy an ashţadaļa padmam or chakram is drawn by the Archaka. Then on this spread of paddy the drum used by the barber musicians or meļakkarans is deposited. This drum is covered over with a new cloth. Punyaham water is sprinkled over the drum now covered with the new cloth.

Then Vishnu is avahanamed on the southern side and on the northern or left side Śrī is made to be present by avahanam. The centre of the drum, which is really a mixture of satva, rajas and tamas, prakṛti is āvāhanamed. Then the bheritadana stick is sprinkled with punyaham water. Some upacharam also is done to it afterwards. Next the "Saptatanmātra mantram is chanted over the bhērt and it is beaten and sounded three times with the stick. While striking the drum with this stick the trimūrti mantram is chanted. The beating of the bheri is began on the right side. The drummer is then called over and as soon as he comes punyaham water is sprinkled over him He is then allowed to take on his bhert and he is then expected to play on the bherr to the accompaniment of nagaswarams.

Just in front of the utsava vigraha a settle of rice is made on the floor. Over it a kumbham (pot) is placed. This pot or kumbham is filled with water and decorated in the usual way. The following devatās are invoked and they are requestd to be present:- Indrādis, divyayudhās, vaikunthanityas, parivārams of Vishnu, kumudadis, marichyadi rshis, Brahma, dwellers in the fourteen lokas, vidyas and vedas.

These devatas are avahanamed in their proper places and bali is given to each of them in order. The music (ragam and talam) should be the ones appropriate to each, but in practice this is ignored and only the ordinary drum is sounded. The giving of bali is done only after the homam and before the procession of God.

The invitation to Vishnu is made only after placing the kumbham on the settle of paddy.
