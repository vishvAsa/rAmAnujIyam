title = "11 1 ABHIGAMANA ĀRĀDHANAM"

+++

The worshipper, before entering the temple, wears flowers, sandal and clothing, cleanses his mouth by means of water after chewing betel-leaf and nuts and cleans his hands and feet. As soon as he enters the temple, he stands at a distance and prostrates before God. Getting up and with the permission of the two dvārapālakās he enters the temple precincts to near God and while doing so he repeats the following :—“ Kausalya suprajā Rāma Pūrvāsandhya pravartate ūttishtha naraśārdūla kartavyam daivāmahnikam Vīra saumya vibuddhyāswa kausalyānandavardhana jagaddhi sarvam svapititvayi supte parantapa॥ Yāminyapaiti yadunātha vimuncha nidrām unmeśhaṁṛcchati tavōnmīshitē na viśvam . jātasvyaṁ khalu jagaddhitamēva kartum dharmapravartana dhiyā dharaṇītalesmin." This when translated runs thus:----"Oh Rama! Kausalya is very fortunate in having a good son. The morning twilight is dawning in the East.

Rise up, Oh tiger among men. The divine daily routine has to be gone through Oh Hero of benign qualities and who increases the happiness of Kausalya, wake up. Oh destroyer of foes, when you sleep the whole world will go to sleep. Oh Lord of Yadu! the night is gone, wake up from your sleep. The whole universe wakes up when you wake up. You are indeed born yourself in this world with the intention of spreading dharma in order to do good to the whole world." Instead of this other ślōkas which rouse God may be repeated. Then he does ārādhana offering tulasī flowers and fruits. He prostrates freely on the floor with bhakti and stands with the hands in a prayerful posture.

While thus standing he repeats the dvaya mantra and then recites the gadya in which the meanings of dvaya are included. Then he prays to God that all things that have to be done should be properly performed and ended well and does śaraṇagati. In the end he looks at auspicious things such as mirror, etc. Afterwards repeating "Saurabheyāś- sarvahitaḥ pavitraḥ punyarāśayaḥ . pratigr̥hṇantvimam grāsaṁ gāvastrailokya mataraḥ ॥" he gives a handful of grass to the cow of others. The above passage when translated into English runs thus:--" Let the cows accept the handful of grass, the cows who are the mothers of the three worlds, who have descended from Surabhi or Kamadhēnu, who are good to all, who are pure and who are a heap of virtue." Afterwards obeisance is to be done to Āchāryas and other elderly men.

If one is not able to do "Abhigamanam" as stated above he may do obeisance to his Āchārya and do bharanyāsam. If he is unable to do even this, then he may repeat "Tirumantra" and think of God. If he is under any pollution he must think of these things in his mind. He should not repeat the usual things then, but he may repeat ordinary Tamil verses or Sanskrit ślōkas other than the above and think of God. From a distance he has to do añjali to God.

Towards the end he repeats the following:--" Bhagavānēva Kṛtancha abhigamakhyam kartāvan" and does sātvikatyāgaṁ and then concludes as follows :- “ ābhigamanēna Vasudēvaḥ ॥." II-A [[०८९]]
