yogākhyam kārayati." He repeats after this "Amalanādipiran, Śrī Vaikuntha gadya, Bhagavaddhyāna Sopānam, etc. and contenplates on God's greatness and his good doings. As soon as he feels sleepy he lies down believing that he is placing his head at the feet of God. If he wakes from sleep till he sleeps again he contemplates on God. Sleep is to be considered as rest to enable one to be able to do Bhagavad āradhana, etc., during the day as usual.

For one who does Bhagavadarādhana during the five periods of the day, all duties become services to God. He does not waste even a second. All the good things one is enjoying becomes part of God's enjoyment only. An orthodox man is expected to spend his time in this manner.
