+++

The performer cleans his hand and feet with water and then does achamanam and sankalpam to perform the Devarshi and Pitr tarpanams as follows:--" Śrīman Narayana pprītyartham snānāngam dēvarshi pitr tarpaṇam karishye." He performs the tarpanam believing that devatas, rshis and pitrs have in them the amsam of God. That is to say he should believe that the spirit of God is in all these.

Then repeating the following mantras he does tarpaṇam, l.e., leaves water mixed with rice and sesamum in his hands as described below :--- "Brahmādayō yēdēvāstān dēvāmstarpayami . sarvān dēvāmstarpayāmi . sarvadēva ganāmstarpayāmi . sarva dēva patnīstarpayāmi . sarvadeva ganapatnīstarpayami." This in English means "I please all Devas from Brahma downwards by the libations of water. I please all Devas by these libations of water. I please all troops of Devas by these libations of water. I please all the wives of the Devas by these libations of water.

I please all the wives of the troops of Devas by these libations of water." Repeating the above he does his tarpanam through the tips of his fingers. Now he has his sacred thread in the usual way, t.e., in the proper way.

He then puts on his sacred thread round his neck with both the hands outside the thread (i e. as nivIt!) and holding with both the thumbs the sacred thread does tarpanam repeating the following. That is he pours water mixed with rice and sesamum while repeating the mantras.

"Om Krishna dvaipayanādayō yē rshayah tan rshīmstarpayāmi . sarvan rshimstarpayāmi . sarva rshi gaṇāmstarpayāmi . sarva rshipatnīstarpayāmi . sarva rshi gana patnīstarpayami . ".

This when translated runs thus:-- "I please all sages from Vyasa onwards by these libations of water. I please all sages or hymn singers by these libations of water. I please the whole host of patriarchal sages by these libations of water. I please all the wives of the sages by these libations of water. I please all the wives of the whole host of patriarchal sages by these libations of water." Then with the sacred thread (yajñōpavita) as prachinaviti (i.e., putting on the sacred thread on the right shoulder and placing the left hand through so that the sacred thread passes round the right shoulder above and the lower portion of the thread passes on the left side below the left shoulder) he proceeds with the tarpaṇam as detailed below. He repeats the following mantra while doing the tarpaṇam:-- "Somahpitsman yamōngirasvan agnikavya vahanadayo ye pitarah tan pitrmstarpayami . sarvān pitrmstarpayami . sarvapitrganāmstarpayaini . sarvapitṛpatnīstarpayāmi . sarva pitsganapatnīstarpayāmi." This means "I please all the Manes commencing from Soma, pitrman, yama, Angirasvan, agni, kavyavahana and others by these libations of water. I please all the Manes by these libations of water. I please ८-A [[०६५]]

the whole class of Manes by these libations of water. I please the wives of the Manes by these libations of water. I please the wives of the whole class of Manes by these libations of water." The above tarpaṇam is performed by pouring water mixed with rice and sesamum between the thumb and the index finger.

Then repeating the following mantra "Urjam vahantīramṛtam ghrtam payah kilalam pariśṛtam svadhasta tarpayatame piton" water is thrown three times after taking the water round in a pradakshina manner on the left side. This water must be thrown thrice on the bank saying each time "Trpyata, trpyata and trpyata." The meaning of the above passage iS May these waters please my Manes, those waters which contain the essence, issuing from flowers, which may be classed as essence of food, ghee and milk which are capable of curing all diseases, preventing death and relieving the bondage of man." Then putting on the yajñopavita in the proper way he does achamanam.

This deva-rshi-pitr-tarpaṇam should not be performed when one does not bathe fully immersing wholly under water or when he is under pollution due to the death of some near relation.
