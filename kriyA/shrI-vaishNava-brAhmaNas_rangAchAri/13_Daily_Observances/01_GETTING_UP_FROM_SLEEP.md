title = "01 GETTING UP FROM SLEEP"

+++

The first thing that one does every day during the early part of the day is the getting up from his bed. He is expected, under ordinary circumstances, to wake up at least half an hour before sunrise and then he is to pronounce the name of God as Hari! Hari! at least six times. Then the person is expected to repeat the ślokas describing the coming of God as Hari and destroying the distress of Gajendra, the chief of the elephants.

God is expected to remove all the sins and since he came out as Hari and destroyed the sorrows of Gajendra, this fact is clearly pointed out in the ślokas repeated. If the person getting up from his bed is strong enough and capable of commanding his time he may repeat the dhyāna ślokas of the १०८ tirupathis, the daśāvatāra stotras, the larger gadya, other stotras of God loudly and in a manner pleasant to be heard by others.

Then sitting in the same bed he thinks of the days that have passed without doing him any good and feels sorry for his not obtaining the moksha so much expected by him.

If the man is one who has not gone through the prapatti ceremony, he should feel for his present position of being an akīnchana, a sinner incapable of getting rid of his sins. Seeing his inability to get rid of his sins and realising his low and incapable position, he feels very sorry. In the case of a prapanna, he should feel for his bondage, but as he is sure of his salvation having surrendered himself to God, he should feel ४

glad of it. Though he may feel dissatisfaction of not having attained moksha he should not be over-powered by that feeling so as to prevent him from attending to his other legitimate duties such as doing service to God. So he must think of his future duties to God as stated in the pasuram "Gatattirku sōkiyādē varugira nirukku aṇaikōlum kaṇakkile". This means "not feeling much for what is past, preparing for the future by proper means." He must spend his time by worshipping God. "Tarittezudi vāsittum kēţţum vanangi vazipattum pūjittum pōkkinen pōdu." When translated this means "I spent my time by writing, reading, hearing, praying and worshipping God." The person then does 'Śrotrachamana' touching his right ear with his right hand and repeats the mantra for 'satvikatyaga', and is believed to become a dependent of God and so prays to Him that his kainkaryas (works to God) may be properly done and then he repeats some stotras (praises) of God well and loudly. If time permits he may repeat portions of his Vedas, such as tiruvais of the same.

"
On getting from his bed he is to repeat the mantra Om namah kshitidharaya".

This means "Oh I pray to you the supporter of this earth." He then prays to Varahamūrti who is supporting the world. He then places his right foot on the floor repeating a prayer to Bhadevi. He then prays to Trivikrama thus:-"Vishnōhkramosi" and walks on.
