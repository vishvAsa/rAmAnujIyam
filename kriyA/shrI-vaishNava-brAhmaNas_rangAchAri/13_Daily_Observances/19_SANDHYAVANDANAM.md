title = "19 SANDHYAVANDANAM"

+++

Towards evening one should change his cloths by wearing fresh ones and do the evening sandhyavandanam. The performer is expected to clean his hands and feet and do prāṇāyāmam. Then he does sankalpam repeating "Śrībhagavadajñaya Śrīman Nārāyaṇaprītyartham sayam sandhyamupāsishyē". Prokshana, etc., are done as in the morning sandhyāvandanam. He does nyasam by repeating "Agniśchētyanuvākasya Suryarshiḥ . devīgayatricchandah . agnirdevatā." Then he takes water in his right hand as if for achamana and says "Apām prāśaně viniyogah" He then says the mantra "Agni- ścha māmanyuaścha manyupatayaścha manyukrtebhyaḥ . pāpēbhyorakshantam yadahnā papama kārsham . manasā vāchā hastābhyām padbhyā mudarēna śiśnā . ahastadavalumpatu yat kincha duritam mayi idamaham mamamrtayōnau . satyējyotishi juhō- mi svāhā " and drinks the water in his hand. (Same meaning as the mantra Sūryascha but some words are changed and they are "agniścha" = fire; "ahna"= day time (in the day time); aha=day time, "satye"== in the form of satyam. The arghya is done facing the west now. Other things are done as in the morning sandhyā.)

Then Japam is begun and the sankalpam should begin with the words usually repeated and it should refer to "Sayam sandhya" instead of "Pratassandhya." In this after repeating "āyātu varadādēvi aksharam brahma sammitam . Gayatrim āvāhayami" he does avahanam and repeats "Sayam sarasvatim śyāmām ravimandala madhyagam . samavedam vyāharantīm chakrayudha dharam śubhām ॥ Dhyāyāmi Vishnudaivatyam vrddhām garudavahanam . " (I contemplate on Sarasvati, as black in colour, repeating Sama Vedam, with chakram in hand, as old, with garuda as vahanam, as Vishnu, devata.)

He repeats the usual upasthāna mantra until "Gaccha dēvi yathā sukham" and after this he does nyasam repeating "Imammalti pancharchasya Devarāta rshih . gayatri trishtup, gāyatri jagati trishtubhaschandāmsi savitā dēvatā." (For the five riks in the mantra Imam me the Rshi is Devaratar; chandas is Gayatri, etc. Devata is the Sun.)

Then he does sankalpam for upasthanam and for it repeats the mantra "Imam me varuna srudhihavamadyacha mrdaya . tvamavasyu rachake . tatvāyāmi brahmanā vanda māna stadāśāste yajamāno havirbhiḥ . Ahedamano Varuṇēha bōdhyuruśagm samāna ayuhpramoshiḥ ॥ yacchiddhi të visðyathā pradeva varunavratam . minimasidyavidyavi . yat kinchēdam varunadaivyē janë abhidroham manushyāścharāmasi . [[१३]]

achitti yattava dharmāyuyōpima manastasmā dēnasō dēvarIrishah ॥ Kitavāsō yadri- ripur nadivi yadvāghā satya mutayanna vidma . sarvātā vishya śithirēva devāthātesyāma varuna priyāsaḥ." Translation:-Oh Varuna! Listen to this prayer of mine. You should make me a happy being now alone. Desiring my protection I am praying to you for my satisfaction.

Therefore I am becoming your slave by praising you by means of Vedas. One who does yaga by the offering of purōdāśa, etc., prays for what he wants Oh Varuna! In this world you should listen and accept my prayers. One who has a big reputation, please do not destroy my life (ayus). Oh Varunadeva! That vrata which is done daily for you daily like men we become destroyers. Oh devata! do not trouble us with those sins which we as human beings by ignorance may have done towards devatās and those sins by which we destroyed your dharmas (good things). Kindly destroy all those sins of ours that were done by us as hypocrites, those sins committed by us knowing them to be sins, and those committed by us without our knowledge Let those sins be destroyed Then we become people well known to you and liked by you.

The remaining part is similar to that done in the morning.

After sandhyāvandanam he does the aupasanam in the evening also as was done in the morning. If possible he does pūja to God as in the morning or day time. He does everything from alankarāsanam to śayanāsanam as already described. During "Bhojyāsanam" all things prepared for the use in the night should be placed before God for nivedanam. Then he does Vaiśvadēvam by doing only the six ahutis and the homam.

Then he eats the food observing all the rules and regulations already described.

After food does Vedadhyayanam, reads Puranas, etc. In the end he does Satvikatyāgam as usual and prays as usual to God.
