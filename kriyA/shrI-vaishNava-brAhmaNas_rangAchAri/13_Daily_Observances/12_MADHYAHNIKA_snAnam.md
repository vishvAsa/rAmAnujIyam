title = "12 MADHYAHNIKA SNĀNAM"

+++

For this snānam also some mantras are repeated as for bathing in the morning.

Just before the bath he repeats the following:-" Avāhayāmi tvām devi snānārthamiha sundari ehigange namastubhyam sarvatirthasamanvite." This when translated runs thus:-" Oh beautiful Goddess! I invite you here for my bathing Oh Ganga! salutation to thee, who possess all the sacred waters of the world." The usual sankalpa, bala mantra and satvikatyāga mantra are repeated before the above mantra. Repeating the above āvāhana mantra he takes water in both his hands and invokes Ganga to come over there. Then arghyam is given repeating "Vishnu vāmā padāngushtha nakhaśrōtō vinisrute . tadbhakti vighna rūpāt tvam gange mam mochayainasah ॥." This in English runs thus:-" Oh Ganga that came out from the nail of the left great toe of Vishnu! Please release me from the sins which stand as obstacles to his devotions." He then bathes for the midday as for the morning and dresses himself as usual after the bath.

Urdhvapingam, etc., are put on the face and various parts of the body.
